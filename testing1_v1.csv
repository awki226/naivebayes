"Tobacco smoking and colorectal cancer: a population-based case-control study in Newfoundland and Labrador. OBJECTIVE: Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) has the highest incidence rate of both colorectal cancer (CRC) and smoking prevalence in Canada. The objective of this study was to examine if CRC is associated with smoking in this population. METHODS: Newly diagnosed cases identified between 1999 and 2003 were frequency-matched by 5-year age group and sex with controls selected from the residents of NL through random digit dialing. A total of 702 cases and 717 controls consented to participate in the study and completed a set of self-administered questionnaires. Measures of tobacco use included type of tobacco, age of initiation of smoking, years of smoking, years since started smoking, number of cigarettes smoked daily, pack years, and years since abstention from smoking. Odds ratios were estimated using multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: In comparison with non-smokers, former and current smokers were at a significantly elevated risk of CRC with corresponding odds ratios of 1.36 and 1.96. The risk significantly increased with cigarette smoking years, the amount of cigarettes smoked daily, and cigarette pack years. The risk significantly decreased with years of abstention from smoking cigarettes. This association was stronger among drinkers and in men. In addition, this effect was observed to be slightly stronger for rectum than colon cancer. DISCUSSION: In summary, cigarette smoking increased the risk of CRC in the NL population. The risk of CRC associated with cigarette smoking varies by sex, drinking status, and site of CRC.",cancer
"Clinicopathological study of male breast cancer in Nigerians and a review of the literature. BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is rare in men, accounting for approximately 1% of all cases of breast carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the incidence, presentation, histopathological types, management and outcome of male patients with breast cancer treated at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria. METHODS: A 20 year (1987-2006) retrospective study of all male patients with breast cancer was done. Clinic demographic data regarding age, sex, clinical information, treatment and follow up were obtained from request cards and case files. Slides were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology and reviewed. RESULTS: Sixteen cases of male breast cancer were encountered. This comprised 18.4% of the breast lesions in males and 2.8% of all breast cancers seen in the Department during the 20 year study period. The ages of patients ranged from 35-90 years with a mean age of 64.4 years. Delay in patient presentation to physician ranged from 14-49 months. Clinically, patients presented mostly with a self-detected lump (87.5%), or ulceration (68.8%), nipple discharge (43.8%) and nipple bleeding (25.0%). Unilaterality was observed in 87.5% of cases were while 12.5% of cases were bilateral (metachronous). Invasive ductal carcinoma (81.25%) was the predominant histological type of cancer. Stage IV disease was most commonly encountered (43.8%). Eleven (68.8%) patients had modified radical mastectomy. Only 31.3% patients came for follow-up, for a median duration of 10 months. CONCLUSION: Male breast cancer is rare and patients present late with advanced disease. Education needs to be intensified to increase awareness of the disease.",cancer
"Detection of micrometastases in lymph nodes using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for cytokeratin 20 (CK-20)--a pilot study. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to detect micrometastases in lymph nodes in patients with rectal cancer following neoadjuvant therapy, staged node negative by routine histology. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Mesenteric lymph nodes from patients who have undergone neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer were harvested during surgery. Nodes were bisected and one half was sent for haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and evaluated by a single pathologist. The other half was examined for CK20 by RT-PCR. The technique was validated by testing mesenteric lymph nodes with known metastases and nodes from patients without cancer. Twenty one lymph nodes from 6 patients (median age 46 years, range 25-55) which were negative for tumour deposits by H & E stain were assessed for micro-metastases. RESULTS: All 21 nodes which were histologically negative for metastases were positive for micrometastases. Two nodes with known metastases were positive for CK20 and 3 nodes from non cancer patients were negative for CK20. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of CK20 is accurate in identification of rectal cancer micro-metastasing to lymph nodes. Assessment of nodes by H & E histology risks under staging.",cancer
"Epiglottoplasty for reconstruction of defects after laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy. OBJECTIVES: We present a novel use of sliding epiglottoplasty as an alternative method for closing mucosal defects in selected laryngectomies with partial pharyngectomy. METHODS: Sliding epiglottoplasty as described and advocated by Sedlacek, Bouche, Kambic, and Tucker for reconstruction in partial laryngectomies was used to close the defects after laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy in 17 patients with advanced hypopharyngeal cancers as primary therapy (16 patients) and as post-radiochemotherapy therapy (1 patient). RESULTS: All reconstructions were successful. Primary closures were achieved without additional morbidity, there were no pharyngocutaneous fistulas, and all patients resumed deglutition. Ten patients acquired esophageal speech, speech valves were inserted in 5 cases, and 2 patients required the use of an electrolarynx. CONCLUSIONS: If the oncological circumstances allow its preservation in laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy, the epiglottis is an ideal structure for closing the defect; it is a local tissue with shape, thickness, rigidity, and borders that match the recipient site. In comparison to distant pedicled or free microvascular flaps, the epiglottoplasty is a shorter procedure, requires a smaller surgical team, results in less trauma, has a lower incidence of complications, and enables faster recovery. It is surprising that this elegant, successful, and generally accepted larynx preservation procedure has not been recognized as useful for larger reconstructions.",cancer
"Prevalence of acoustic neuroma associated with each configuration of pure tone audiogram in patients with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss. OBJECTIVES: The criteria have not yet been established for identifying the configuration of a pure tone audiogram constituting abnormal results that warrant further investigation. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of acoustic neuroma associated with each configuration of the pure tone audiogram in patients with asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of 500 patients 15 years of age or older who had asymmetric SNHL and had undergone magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: The prevalence of acoustic neuroma in these patients was 2.6% (13 of 500). The prevalence of acoustic neuroma in each audiometric configuration was as follows: 7.1% (3 of 42) for a basin-shaped loss (odds ratio [OR] versus overall prevalence, 2.88; p = 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 10.54), 4.7% (5 of 107) for a flat loss, 3.4% (2 of 58) for total deafness, 2.9% (1 of 34) for a high-frequency sloping audiogram, and 2.5% (2 of 81) for a high-frequency steep audiogram. The prevalence in patients with nonimproving idiopathic sudden deafness was 8.1% (OR, 3.29; p = 0.06; 95% CI, 1.13 to 9.55). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 2.9% to 8.1% of patients with a characteristic configuration of the pure tone audiogram and symptoms of nonimproving or progressive idiopathic sudden deafness may have acoustic neuroma.",cancer
"Natural history of incidental World Health Organization grade II gliomas. OBJECTIVE: Seizure is the presenting symptom in most of World Health Organization grade II gliomas (GIIGs). Rarely, a GIIG is discovered incidentally on imaging. Little is known about the natural course and prognosis of incidental GIIGs. The aim of the present study is to characterize their natural history and to investigate whether their clinical and radiological behaviors differ from those of symptomatic GIIGs. METHODS: The clinical and radiological findings, treatments, and outcomes of 47 histologically-proven incidental GIIGs were compared with those of 1249 symptomatic GIIGs. RESULTS: Incidental GIIGs differ significantly from symptomatic GIIGs: they have a female predominance (p = 0.05), smaller initial tumor volumes (p < 0.001), lower incidence of contrast enhancement (p = 0.009), and are more likely to undergo gross total surgical removal (p < 0.001). Proliferation rates were similar to that observed among symptomatic GIIGs. Younger age at the time of discovery, frontal lobes, and noneloquent brain regions were associated with incidental GIIGs, as compared to their symptomatic counterparts. When not treated, incidental GIIGs demonstrated radiological growth (median velocity of diametric expansion at 3.5 mm/year), and became symptomatic at a median interval of 48 months after radiological discovery. Overall, incidental discovery was associated with a significant survival benefit (p = 0.04). INTERPRETATION: Incidental GIIGs are progressive tumors leading to clinical transformation toward symptomatic GIIGs. They may represent an earlier step in the natural history of a glioma than the symptomatic GIIGs.",cancer
"Utilizing targeted cancer therapeutic agents in combination: novel approaches and urgent requirements. The rapid development of new therapeutic agents that target specific molecular pathways involved in tumour cell proliferation provides an unprecedented opportunity to achieve a much higher degree of biochemical specificity than previously possible with traditional chemotherapeutic anticancer agents. However, the lack of specificity of these established chemotherapeutic drugs allowed a relatively straightforward approach to their use in combination therapies. Developing a paradigm for combining new, molecularly targeted agents, on the other hand, is substantially more complex. The abundance of molecular data makes it possible, at least in theory, to predict how such agents might interact across crucial growth control networks. Initial strategies to examine molecularly targeted agent combinations have produced a small number of successes in the clinic. However, for most of these combination strategies, both in preclinical models and in patients, it is not clear whether the agents being combined actually hit their targets to induce growth inhibition. Here, we consider the initial approach of the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) to the evaluation of combinations of molecularly targeted anticancer agents in patients and provide a description of several new approaches that the NCI has initiated to improve the effectiveness of combination-targeted therapy for cancer.",cancer
"Dueling models in head and neck tumor formation. The two leading models that have been used to explain tumor progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are the stochastic clonal evolution model, in which many tumor cells are individually capable of recapitulating the entire tumor mass, and the cancer stem hierarchy model, in which only rare totipotential tumor stem cells can recapitulate the tumor. In this issue, Cameron et al use cell surface marker and clonal cell analyses in combination with a xenotransplant approach to provide data that support the stochastic clonal evolution model in HNSCC. This interpretation is subject, however, to limitations inherent in the experimental approach employed. Understanding the basis of tumor progression in HNSCC as well as other cancers should be further explored because of important implications for effective treatments.",cancer
"A biochemical mechanism for the oncogenic potential of the p110beta catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Class I PI3-kinases signal downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors and have been implicated in tumorigenesis. Although the oncogenic potential of the PI3-kinase subunit p110alpha requires its mutational activation, other p110 isoforms can induce transformation when overexpressed in the wild-type state. In wild-type p110alpha, N345 in the C2 domain forms hydrogen bonds with D560 and N564 in the inter-SH2 (iSH2) domain of p85, and mutations of p110alpha or p85 that disrupt this interface lead to increased basal activity and transformation. Sequence analysis reveals that N345 in p110alpha aligns with K342 in p110beta. This difference makes wild-type p110beta analogous to a previously described oncogenic mutant, p110alpha-N345K. We now show that p110beta is inhibited by p85 to a lesser extent than p110alpha and is not differentially inhibited by wild-type p85 versus p85 mutants that disrupt the C2-iSH2 domain interface. Similar results were seen in soft agar and focus-formation assays, where p110beta was similar to p110alpha-N345K in transforming potential. Inhibition of p110beta by p85 was enhanced by a K342N mutation in p110beta, which led to decreased activity in vitro, decreased basal Akt and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) activation, and decreased transformation in NIH 3T3 cells. Moreover, unlike wild-type p110beta, p110beta-K342N was differentially regulated by wild-type and mutant p85, suggesting that the inhibitory C2-iSH2 interface is functional in this mutant. This study shows that the enhanced transforming potential of p110beta is the result of its decreased inhibition by p85, due to the disruption of an inhibitory C2-iSH2 domain interface.",cancer
"Gene therapy-mediated delivery of targeted cytotoxins for glioma therapeutics. Restricting the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents by targeting receptors exclusively expressed on tumor cells is critical when treating infiltrative brain tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). GBMs express an IL-13 receptor (IL13Ralpha2) that differs from the physiological IL4R/IL13R receptor. We developed a regulatable adenoviral vector (Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE) encoding a mutated human IL-13 fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin (mhIL-13-PE) that specifically binds to IL13Ralpha2 to provide sustained expression, effective anti-GBM cytotoxicity, and minimal neurotoxicity. The therapeutic Ad also encodes mutated human IL-4 that binds to the physiological IL4R/IL13R without interacting with IL13Ralpha2, thus inhibiting potential binding of mhIL-13-PE to normal brain cells. Using intracranial GBM xenografts and syngeneic mouse models, we tested the Ad.mhIL-4.TRE.mhIL-13-PE and two protein formulations, hIL-13-PE used in clinical trials (Cintredekin Besudotox) and a second-generation mhIL-13-PE. Cintredekin Besudotox doubled median survival without eliciting long-term survival and caused severe neurotoxicity; mhIL-13-PE led to approximately 40% long-term survival, eliciting severe neurological toxicity at the high dose tested. In contrast, Ad-mediated delivery of mhIL-13-PE led to tumor regression and long-term survival in over 70% of the animals, without causing apparent neurotoxicity. Although Cintredekin Besudotox was originally developed to target GBM, when tested in a phase III trial it failed to achieve clinical endpoints and revealed neurotoxicity. Limitations of Cintredekin Besudotox include its short half-life, which demanded frequent or continued administration, and binding to IL4R/IL13R, present in normal brain cells. These shortcomings were overcome by our therapeutic Ad, thus representing a significant advance in the development of targeted therapeutics for GBM.",cancer
"Improving outcomes for patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most commonly occurring form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the western world. Until the mid 1990s the incidence of DLBCL increased in both sexes, across racial categories, and across all age groups except the very young, the etiology of most cases remains unknown. DLBCL is associated with an aggressive natural history, but it can be cured with combination chemotherapy regimens like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), which has been the mainstay of therapy for several decades. Remarkable progress has been made in understanding the biological heterogeneity of DLBCL and in improving survival for DLBCL patients with novel combinations of chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Gene expression profiling (GEP) has uncovered DLBCL subtypes that have distinct clinical behaviors and prognoses, and the addition of the monoclonal antibody, rituximab, to CHOP has markedly improved outcomes. Future approaches to DLBCL management will use molecular signatures identified through GEP to provide prognostic information and to isolate therapeutic targets that are being evaluated for DLBCL patients who relapse or those with high risk disease.",cancer
"Mechanism of synergistic antitumor effect of sorafenib and interferon-alpha on treatment of renal cell carcinoma. PURPOSE: The multikinase and tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib has antitumor activity in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma. Recent reports show the ability of sorafenib to synergize with interferon-alpha, leading to greater antitumor activity. We examined the underlying mechanism of sorafenib and interferon-alpha synergism for renal cell carcinoma treatment in vitro and in tumor bearing murine models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used murine and human renal cell carcinoma cell lines for in vitro cell proliferation assay. ACHN (ATCC(R)) and RENCA tumors were subcutaneously transplanted into NCr-nu/nu and syngeneic BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Yokohama, Japan), respectively. Mice were treated with sorafenib and/or interferon-alpha, and tumor growth was monitored. Immunological assays were done in the RENCA model. RESULTS: In the ACHN and RENCA cell lines combination index analysis clearly revealed the synergistic antiproliferative effects of interferon-alpha and sorafenib in vitro. In the ACHN NCr-nu/nu model we clearly noted the synergistic antitumor effects of interferon-alpha and sorafenib, indicating the synergistic direct effects of each drug on tumor growth. In the RENCA BALB/c model flow cytometry showed no change in the proportion of lymphocytes. However, while sorafenib alone did not induce natural killer or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity against RENCA in that model, interferon-alpha alone or combined with sorafenib induced natural killer and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the synergistic activity of interferon-alpha and sorafenib. These findings provided the rationale for combination therapy with interferon-alpha and sorafenib in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.",cancer
"Histone deacetylase inhibitor potentiates anticancer effect of docetaxel via modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins and tubulin in hormone refractory prostate cancer cells. PURPOSE: We evaluated the antitumor effects of docetaxel (Sigma(R)) and histone deacetylase inhibitors in hormone refractory prostate cancer cells, and analyzed the mechanism by which combination treatment induced cell death. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 cells (ATCC(R)) to evaluate the in vitro apoptotic effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors and their combinations with docetaxel as well as the molecular mechanisms. The DU145 xenograft model was used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of PXD101 combined with docetaxel. RESULTS: Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid or PXD101 inhibited the growth of hormone dependent LNCaP cells, and hormone independent DU145 and PC3 cells. It increased sub-G1 population and activated caspase-8, 9 and 3, indicating apoptosis induction. Pretreating DU145 cells with docetaxel followed by histone deacetylase inhibitors showed significant synergistic cytotoxicity compared with that of simultaneous co-treatment or reverse sequential treatment. Pretreatment with docetaxel followed by histone deacetylase inhibitors increased the apoptotic sub-G1 population, caspase activation and tubulin acetylation compared with that of docetaxel alone. Combination treatment decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-xl, and increased t-Bid, Bik and Bim. Combined docetaxel and PXD101 reduced tumor size with efficacy equivalent to that of a double dose of docetaxel alone in the DU145 xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: These preclinical results indicate that the sequential combination of docetaxel and histone deacetylase inhibitors led to a synergistic increase in the death of hormone refractory prostate cancer cells via intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways by modulating Bcl-2 family proteins and tubulin in vitro and in vivo. Results suggest that this combination may be a new therapeutic modality in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer.",cancer
"DNA damage-mediated induction of a chemoresistant niche. While numerous cell-intrinsic processes are known to play decisive roles in chemotherapeutic response, relatively little is known about the impact of the tumor microenvironment on therapeutic outcome. Here, we use a well-established mouse model of Burkitt's lymphoma to show that paracrine factors in the tumor microenvironment modulate lymphoma cell survival following the administration of genotoxic chemotherapy. Specifically, IL-6 and Timp-1 are released in the thymus in response to DNA damage, creating a ""chemo-resistant niche"" that promotes the survival of a minimal residual tumor burden and serves as a reservoir for eventual tumor relapse. Notably, IL-6 is released acutely from thymic endothelial cells in a p38-dependent manner following genotoxic stress, and this acute secretory response precedes the gradual induction of senescence in tumor-associated stromal cells. Thus, conventional chemotherapies can induce tumor regression while simultaneously eliciting stress responses that protect subsets of tumor cells in select anatomical locations from drug action.",cancer
"Preparation and evaluation of carborane analogues of tamoxifen. A stereoselective synthesis of closo carborane analogues of tamoxifen was developed where the products represent a new approach to developing metabolically robust SERMs. The A-ring found in the backbone of tamoxifen was replaced with an ortho carborane cluster; the product was determined to be the desired Z isomer, which showed superior chemical stability to tamoxifen both in solution and in the solid state. By use of microwave heating, it was possible to convert some of the Z carborane tamoxifen analogue to the corresponding E isomer. Cell growth assays using both isomers and a carborane that is known to target the ER were conducted using estrogen receptor (ER) positive and ER negative human breast cancer cells with and without the presence of estradiol (E2). The Z carborane isomer was able to inhibit cell proliferation better than tamoxifen in an E2 free environment, while the E isomer inhibited cell growth better than tamoxifen when E2 was present.",cancer
"Familial pleuropulmonary blastoma in Australia. We present three cases of pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) in Australian children. Each had a family history of childhood tumors which collectively included PPB, infant lung cyst, cystic nephroma, medullo-epithelioma and a Sertoli-Leydig ovarian tumor. Two of the patients also had additional malignancies: a concurrent bladder rhabdomyosarcoma and a post therapy non-PPB malignant lung tumor. In two cases, the family histories were elicited years after the PPB diagnosis. Archived pathology material allowed revision of pathologic diagnoses from decades earlier. These cases illustrate the importance of detailed inquiry into family medical history and the pleiotropy of the PPB-related familial cancer predisposition syndrome, which appears to result from heterozygous DICER1 mutations.",cancer
"Bilateral conjunctival extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma. Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (EMZLs), while relatively common in adults, are rare entities in the pediatric population. A subclass of the typically aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas, the few reported pediatric cases indicate that, as in adults, these tumors tend to be indolent. We present a case of EMZL arising in the conjunctivae in a 9-year-old male with bilateral disease. The patient was treated with surgical excision alone and has remained disease-free 6 years after the operation.",cancer
"Child-related determinants of health-related quality of life in children with brain tumours 1 year after diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: Infratentorial tumour site and health-related quality of life (HRQL) 1 month after diagnosis have been shown to predict HRQL 1 year after diagnosis in children with brain tumours. This study aimed to identify additional early child-related determinants of parent- and child-report HRQL. METHODS: Longitudinal prospective study. Semi-structured interviews took place approximately 1 and 12 months after diagnosis. HRQL was measured using the self- and parent-report Pediatric Quality of Life Scales (PedsQL 4.0) Total Scale Score and Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) multi-attribute utility function. Child variables included performance and verbal IQ, general memory, selective attention executive function, behaviour problems, adaptive behaviour, symptoms of depression and anxiety and event related anxiety. Univariate analyses were used to identify potential early predictors of HRQL. Regression analysis was then used to identify the most important determinants of HRQL at 1 year. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients completed the 12-month interviews. Multivariate analysis showed infratentorial tumour site remained an important determinant of HRQL 1 year after diagnosis. Infratentorial tumour site and selective attention at 1 month generally best predicted poor self- and parent-report HRQL at 12 months. Adaptive behaviour and performance IQ may be important. CONCLUSION: Selective attention and infratentorial tumour site are most important in predicting both parent- and self-report HRQL at 1 year after diagnosis. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings. Cognitive remediation or/and pharmacological intervention, particularly aimed at children with infratentorial tumours may improve attention and subsequently HRQL and both merit further investigation.",cancer
"Nutritional intake of long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: evidence for bone health interventional opportunities. BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are vulnerable to exaggeration of the aging process including decreased bone mineral density (BMD). As little is known about their dietary or nutrient intake that may affect their long-term bone health, we examined nutrient intake in long-term survivors of childhood ALL. PROCEDURE: Survivors (n = 164) of childhood ALL who had completed treatment for at least 5 years and were in continuous remission, completed a 110-item food questionnaire that reflected dietary intake over the previous year. The analyzed cohort comprised 34 females and 38 males younger than 19 years and 45 females and 47 males at least 19 years. Reported nutrient intake and food selection were compared with age-specific Recommended Dietary Allowance and USDA Pyramid Food Guide. Body mass index was compared to the general US population, adjusted for age, gender, Tanner stage and race. RESULTS: Less than 30% of participants met recommended dietary intakes for vitamin D, calcium, potassium, or magnesium regardless of age. Mean daily caloric intake was 2,204 kcal (51% from carbohydrates) for younger and 2,160 kcal (49% from carbohydrates) for older participants. Energy intake from sweets was 70% higher than recommended. Participants < 19 years were less likely to have a healthy weight (odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.79); > 19 years more likely to be overweight (odds ratio 1.95, 95% CI 1.11-3.32, P < 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood ALL need careful dietary intervention to optimize long-term health.",cancer
"Correlation between pre- or postoperative MRI findings and cerebellar sequelae in patients with medulloblastomas. INTRODUCTION: Immediate and delayed cerebellar dysfunction may be expected after surgical resection of a medulloblastoma. We investigated whether pre-operative and delayed post-operative MRI may correlate with such sequelae. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data of 31 patients in continuous complete remission after removal of medulloblastoma, irradiation and chemotherapy, were retrospectively reviewed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was analyzed for the following items: preoperative MRI (ratio of the surface of the tumor/posterior fossa, presence of ventricular dilatation or tonsilar hernia, involvement of the dentate nucleus) and delayed post-operative MRI (amount of cerebellar parenchyma removed, degree of cerebellar atrophy, presence of T1 hypointense regions in remaining cerebellar area and removal of region containing dentate nucleus). These data were correlated with immediate and long-term cerebellar syndrome and daily life repercussions. RESULTS: On preoperative MRI, the ratio of the surface of the tumor/posterior fossa and the presence of tonsilar hernia were significantly correlated with long-term sequelae on speech (respectively P = 0.027 and P = 0.05). Initial supratentorial ventricular dilatation was correlated with ability to sustain adequately daily tasks (P = 0.002). On delayed MRI, cerebellar atrophy was inversely correlated with ability to sustain daily tasks (P = 0.002). Hypointense T1 territory in remaining cerebellar parenchyma significantly correlated with immediate post-operative cerebellar syndrome (P = 0.01) and showed a tendency for post-operative mutism (P = 0.087) but was not correlated with any long-term sequelae. CONCLUSION: Increased cranial pressure on initial MRI and cerebellar atrophy detected on subsequent MRI studies correlated with immediate and long-term cerebellar sequelae.",cancer
"KIR receptor-ligand incompatibility predicts killing of osteosarcoma cell lines by allogeneic NK cells. BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) incompatible, alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells has been primarily documented in hematological malignancies following stem-cell transplant. This effect has not been thoroughly evaluated for pediatric solid tumors. In this study, we evaluated KIR receptor-ligand incompatibility of NK cells against osteosarcoma cell lines. PROCEDURE: Following the KIR receptor-ligand mismatch model, MHC I cell surface expression and KIR ligand mRNA content of 3 osteosarcoma cell lines was determined by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. NK cells were isolated from healthy volunteer donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and KIR surface expression determined by flow cytometry. An Annexin-V based flow cytometric killing assay was used to determine % of dying osteosarcoma target cells by donor NK effector cells. RESULTS: One of seven healthy volunteer donors tested lacked phenotypic expression of one KIR. However, variable expression of KIR ligands was observed in 3 osteosarcoma cell lines. The highest rates of dying cells were seen in osteosarcoma cells with the lowest KIR ligand expression. Following down-regulation of KIR ligand expression, an increased susceptibility to NK cell-mediated killing was observed in a previously NK-resistant osteosarcoma cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Variable MHC I and KIR ligand expression was observed in osteosarcoma cell lines and this resulted in variable susceptibility to NK cell-mediated killing predicted by the degree of KIR receptor-ligand incompatibility. Collectively, these data provide rationale for the study of KIR incompatible stem-cell transplant for osteosarcoma, although further studies with fresh osteosarcoma samples are necessary.",cancer
"Monitoring of minimal residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia with frequent and rare patient-specific NPM1 mutations. Nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations in exon 12 are the most common genetic alternation in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). Although mutation types A, B, and D represent the majority of cases, rare mutation variants of the NPM1 gene in individual patients do occur. In this study, we have evaluated a novel, DNA-based real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) for the detection of three of the most commonly occurring mutations and for six rare patient-specific mutation types, which represent 28% of all of the NPM1 mutations in our group of 25 CN-AML patients. Furthermore, the prognostic relevance of NPM1-based monitoring of minimal residual disease (MRD) in peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), and in specific cell subsets (CD34(+), CD34(-), CD34(dim)) of BM were evaluated. In 80% of the evaluable patients, a molecular relapse preceded a hematological relapse. Moreover, in this subset of patients, the molecular relapse occurred at a median of 97 days before the hematological relapse. Our compartment analysis showed a strong correlation between BM and PB (r = 0.907, P < 0.001) as well as a high copy number of mutated NPM1 in CD34(+) BM cells. In conclusion, we have demonstrated applicability of our presented RQ-PCR method for a large percentage of mutated NPM1 patients with CN-AML as well as the usefulness for long-term follow-up monitoring of MRD and the prediction of hematological relapse.",cancer
"Distant metastasis occurs late during the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer. Metastasis, the dissemination and growth of neoplastic cells in an organ distinct from that in which they originated, is the most common cause of death in cancer patients. This is particularly true for pancreatic cancers, where most patients are diagnosed with metastatic disease and few show a sustained response to chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Whether the dismal prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to patients with other types of cancer is a result of late diagnosis or early dissemination of disease to distant organs is not known. Here we rely on data generated by sequencing the genomes of seven pancreatic cancer metastases to evaluate the clonal relationships among primary and metastatic cancers. We find that clonal populations that give rise to distant metastases are represented within the primary carcinoma, but these clones are genetically evolved from the original parental, non-metastatic clone. Thus, genetic heterogeneity of metastases reflects that within the primary carcinoma. A quantitative analysis of the timing of the genetic evolution of pancreatic cancer was performed, indicating at least a decade between the occurrence of the initiating mutation and the birth of the parental, non-metastatic founder cell. At least five more years are required for the acquisition of metastatic ability and patients die an average of two years thereafter. These data provide novel insights into the genetic features underlying pancreatic cancer progression and define a broad time window of opportunity for early detection to prevent deaths from metastatic disease.",cancer
"The patterns and dynamics of genomic instability in metastatic pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a five-year mortality of 97-98%, usually due to widespread metastatic disease. Previous studies indicate that this disease has a complex genomic landscape, with frequent copy number changes and point mutations, but genomic rearrangements have not been characterized in detail. Despite the clinical importance of metastasis, there remain fundamental questions about the clonal structures of metastatic tumours, including phylogenetic relationships among metastases, the scale of ongoing parallel evolution in metastatic and primary sites, and how the tumour disseminates. Here we harness advances in DNA sequencing to annotate genomic rearrangements in 13 patients with pancreatic cancer and explore clonal relationships among metastases. We find that pancreatic cancer acquires rearrangements indicative of telomere dysfunction and abnormal cell-cycle control, namely dysregulated G1-to-S-phase transition with intact G2-M checkpoint. These initiate amplification of cancer genes and occur predominantly in early cancer development rather than the later stages of the disease. Genomic instability frequently persists after cancer dissemination, resulting in ongoing, parallel and even convergent evolution among different metastases. We find evidence that there is genetic heterogeneity among metastasis-initiating cells, that seeding metastasis may require driver mutations beyond those required for primary tumours, and that phylogenetic trees across metastases show organ-specific branches. These data attest to the richness of genetic variation in cancer, brought about by the tandem forces of genomic instability and evolutionary selection.",cancer
"Promoter polymorphisms in the beta-2 adrenergic receptor are associated with drug-induced gene expression changes and response in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We investigated whether genetic polymorphisms in the promoter region of the proapoptotic beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene (ADRB2) influence treatment-induced changes in ADRB2 expression in leukemia cells and response to chemotherapy. The ADRB2 promoter region was genotyped in germline DNA from 369 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). For 95 of the patients, sufficient RNA was available before and after in vivo treatment to assess treatment-induced gene expression changes in ALL cells. After treatment, the median ADRB2 mRNA expression was ninefold lower in leukemia cells of patients who ultimately relapsed as compared with patients who remained in continuous complete remission (CCR). Polymorphisms in the ADRB2 promoter were significantly linked to methotrexate (MTX)-induced upregulation in ADRB2 gene expression in ALL cells. Moreover, the ADRB2 promoter haplotype was significantly related to early treatment response in 245 children with ALL who received uniform treatment. We conclude that germline polymorphisms in ADRB2 are linked to the antileukemic effects of ALL chemotherapy.",cancer
"Endoxifen, a new cornerstone of breast cancer therapy: demonstration of safety, tolerability, and systemic bioavailability in healthy human subjects. Endoxifen is an active metabolite of tamoxifen, a drug used in the treatment of breast cancer. In order to be clinically effective, tamoxifen must be converted to endoxifen by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). A study involving single escalating oral doses was conducted in humans to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of endoxifen. This is the first study demonstrating that single oral doses of endoxifen are safe and well tolerated and have sufficient bioavailability to reach systemically effective levels in human subjects. Furthermore, it was found that endoxifen is rapidly absorbed and systemically available and that it displays dose proportionality in peak drug concentrations in plasma (C(max)) and area under the concentration-time curve extrapolated from 0 to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) over the dose range 0.5-4.0 mg.",cancer
"A phase I study of the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of oral pazopanib with a high-fat or low-fat meal in patients with advanced solid tumors. Pazopanib is an oral angiogenesis inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and cytokine receptor. This open-label, randomized, crossover, phase I study evaluated the effect of low- and high-fat meals on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pazopanib in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients participated in either the lead-in cohort or randomized food-effect cohort. Patients in the lead-in cohort were administered a single dose of pazopanib 400 mg with a high-fat meal. Patients in the food-effect cohort were randomized to receive single doses of pazopanib 800 mg in fed condition (high- or low-fat meal) or fasting condition, in random sequence 14 days apart. After completion of the study, patients were given the opportunity to continue treatment with daily pazopanib 800 mg. Administration of pazopanib with both low- and high-fat meals increased maximum observed plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by approximately twofold as compared with the corresponding values when administered to patients in the fasted condition. Therefore, pazopanib should be administered to patients in the fasted state so as to minimize within- and between-day variability in the systemic exposure to pazopanib in patients with cancer.",cancer
"Correlation between imatinib pharmacokinetics and clinical response in Japanese patients with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Despite the outstanding results generally obtained with imatinib mesylate (IM) in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), some patients show a poor molecular response. To evaluate the relationship between steady-state trough plasma IM concentration (IM-C(min)) and clinical response in CML patients, we integrated data from six independent Japanese studies. Among 254 CML patients, the mean IM-C(min) was 1,010.5 ng/ml. Importantly, IM-C(min) was significantly higher in patients who achieved a major molecular response (MMR) than in those who did not (P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that an MMR was associated with both age (odds ratio (OR) = 0.97 (0.958-0.995); P = 0.0153) and with IM-C(min) (OR = 1.0008 (1.0003-1.0015); P = 0.0044). Given that patients with IM-C(min) values >1,002 ng/ml had a higher probability of achieving an MMR in our large cohort (P = 0.0120), the data suggest that monitoring of IM levels in plasma may improve the efficacy of IM therapy for CML patients.",cancer
"Rye whole grain and bran intake compared with refined wheat decreases urinary C-peptide, plasma insulin, and prostate specific antigen in men with prostate cancer. Rye whole grain and bran intake has shown beneficial effects on prostate cancer progression in animal models, including lower tumor take rates, smaller tumor volumes, and reduced prostate specific antigen (PSA) concentrations. A human pilot study showed increased apoptosis after consumption of rye bran bread. In this study, we investigated the effect of high intake of rye whole grain and bran on prostate cancer progression as assessed by PSA concentration in men diagnosed with prostate cancer. Seventeen participants were provided with 485 g rye whole grain and bran products (RP) or refined wheat products with added cellulose (WP), corresponding to ~50% of daily energy intake, in a randomized controlled, crossover design. Blood samples were taken from fasting men before and after 2, 4, and 6 wk of treatment and 24-h urine samples were collected before the first intervention period and after treatment. Plasma total PSA concentrations were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP, with a mean treatment effect of -14% (P = 0.04). Additionally, fasting plasma insulin and 24-h urinary C-peptide excretion were lower after treatment with RP compared with WP (P < 0.01 and P = 0.01, respectively). Daily excretion of 5 lignans was higher after the RP treatment than after the WP treatment (P < 0.001). We conclude that whole grain and bran from rye resulted in significantly lower plasma PSA compared with a cellulose-supplemented refined wheat diet in patients with prostate cancer. The effect may be related to inhibition of prostate cancer progression caused by decreased exposure to insulin, as indicated by plasma insulin and urinary C-peptide excretion.",cancer
"Is soy consumption good or bad for the breast? Genistein in soy activates estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and ERbeta and acts as an estradiol in multiple target tissues. Because estrogens increase breast cancer risk and genistein promotes the growth of ER-positive human breast cancer cells, it has remained unclear whether this isoflavone or soy is safe. Results reviewed here suggest that women consuming moderate amounts of soy throughout their life have lower breast cancer risk than women who do not consume soy; however, this protective effect may originate from soy intake early in life. We also review the literature regarding potential risks genistein poses for breast cancer survivors. Findings obtained in 2 recent human studies show that a moderate consumption of diet containing this isoflavone does not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence in Western women, and Asian breast cancer survivors exhibit better prognosis if they continue consuming a soy diet. The mechanisms explaining the breast cancer risk-reducing effect of early soy intake or the protective effect in Asian breast cancer survivors remain to be established. We propose that the reduction in risk involves epigenetic changes that result in alterations in the expression of genes that regulate mammary epithelial cell fate, i.e. cell proliferation and differentiation. Lifetime soy consumption at a moderate level may prevent breast cancer recurrence through mechanisms that change the biology of tumors; e.g. women who consumed soy during childhood develop breast cancers that express significantly reduced Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 levels. More research is needed to understand why soy intake during early life may both reduce breast cancer risk and risk of recurrence.",cancer
"Effect of repeated invitations on uptake of colorectal cancer screening using faecal occult blood testing: analysis of prevalence and incidence screening. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effects of prevalence and incidence screening on uptake and detection of cancer in an ongoing, dynamic programme for colorectal screening using faecal occult blood testing. DESIGN: Analysis of prevalence and incidence screening. SETTING: Three rounds of biennial colorectal screening using the guaiac faecal occult blood test in east and north east Scotland, March 2000 to May 2007. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged 50-69. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Uptake of screening, test positivity (percentage of those invited who returned a test that was positive and triggered an invitation for colonoscopy), positive predictive value, and stage of cancer. RESULTS: Of 510 990 screening episodes in all three rounds, 248 998 (48.7%) were for prevalence, 163 483 (32.0%) were for first incidence, and 98 509 (19.3%) were for second incidence. Uptake of a first invitation for prevalence screening was 53% and for a second and third invitation was 15% and 12%. In the cohort invited for the first round, uptake of prevalence screening rose from 55% in the first round to 63% in the third. The uptake of first incidence screening on a first invitation was 54% and on a second invitation was 86% and on a first invitation for second incidence screening was 46%. The positivity rate in prevalence screening was 1.9% and the uptake of colonoscopy was 87%. The corresponding values for a first incidence screen were 1.7% and 90% and for a second incidence screen were 1.1% and 94.5%. The positive predictive value of a positive faecal occult blood test result for cancer was 11.0% for prevalence screening, 6.5% for the first incidence screen, and 7.5% for the second incidence screen. The corresponding values for the positive predictive value for adenoma were 35.5%, 29.4%, and 26.7%. The proportion of cancers at stage I dropped from 46.5% for prevalence screening to 41% for first incidence screening and 35% for second incidence screening. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat invitations to those who do not take up the offer of screening increases the number of those who accept, for both prevalence screening and incidence screening. Although the positive predictive value for both cancer and adenomas fell between the prevalence screen and the first incidence screen, they did not fall between the first and second incidence screens. The deterioration in cancer stage from prevalence to incidence screening suggests that some cancers picked up at incidence screening may have been missed on prevalence screening, but the stage distribution is still favourable. These data vindicate the policies of continuing to offer screening to those who fail to participate and continuing to offer biennial screening to those who have accepted previous offers.",cancer
"The neurodevelopmental sequelae of childhood leukaemia and its treatment. The overall survival of childhood leukaemia has increased dramatically over recent decades. With the increasing number of survivors, chemotherapy protocols are designed not only to improve cure rates but also to minimise long-term sequelae. Central-nervous-system-directed therapy given as intrathecal chemotherapy and/or cranial irradiation plays a crucial part in acute leukaemia treatment but can also result in adverse effects on the developing brain. The elimination of cranial irradiation from current treatment protocols has improved the neurocognitive outcome without compromising survival rates. Although neurodevelopmental long-term sequelae after chemotherapy-only central-nervous-system-directed therapies may be more subtle, survivors of childhood leukaemia will continue to require methodical follow-up and appropriate rehabilitation.",cancer
"Management of giant hemangioma of the liver: resection versus observation. BACKGROUND: Management of patients with giant hemangiomas of the liver encounters persistent controversy. Although recent case series suggest a low complication rate with nonoperative management, the classic paradigm of preventive operative resection remains. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 492 patients with giant hepatic hemangioma (>4 cm in size) diagnosed between 1985 and 2005 at Mayo Clinic Rochester. Long-term outcomes were assessed by patient survey, with a follow-up of 11 +/- 6.4 years. RESULTS: Of 492 patients, 289 responded to the survey. In the nonoperative group (n = 233), 20% had persistent or new onset of hemangioma-associated symptoms, including potentially life-threatening complications in 2%. In the operative group (n = 56), perioperative complications occurred in 14%, including potentially life-threatening complications in 7%. None of the operative patients had persistent or new onset of hemangioma-associated symptoms after resection of the dominant hemangioma. In group comparison, the rate of adverse events was similar (20% versus 14%; p = 0.45) with an overall low risk for potentially life-threatening complications (2% versus 7%; p = 0.07). Size of hemangiomas was not associated with adverse events in either group. Subjective health status and quality of life at follow-up were similar in both groups (p > 0.54). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical observation of patients with giant hemangioma of the liver has a similar rate of complications compared with operative management, but might prevent the need for invasive interventions in some patients. Clinical observation is preferred in most patients and operative treatment should be reserved for patients with severe symptoms or disease-associated complications.",cancer
"Surgical resection for locoregional esophageal cancer is underutilized in the United States. BACKGROUND: Although esophagectomy provides the highest probability of cure in patients with esophageal cancer, many candidates are never referred for surgery. We hypothesized that esophagectomy for esophageal cancer is underused, and we assessed the prevalence of resection in national, state, and local cancer data registries. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical stage, surgical and nonsurgical treatments, age, and race of patients with cancer of the esophagus were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry (1988 to 2004), the Healthcare Association of NY State registry (HANYS 2007), and a single referral center (2000 to 2007). SEER identified a total of 25,306 patients with esophageal cancer (average age 65.0 years, male-to-female ratio 3:1). HANYS identified 1,012 cases of esophageal cancer (average age 67 years, M:F ratio 3:1); stage was not available from NY State registry data. A single referral center identified 385 patients (48 per year; average age 67 years, M:F 3:1). For SEER data, logistic regression was used to examine determinants of esophageal resection; variables tested included age, race, and gender. RESULTS: Surgical exploration was performed in 29% of the total and only 44.2% of potentially resectable patients. Esophageal resection was performed in 44% of estimated cancer patients in NY State. By comparison, 64% of patients at a specialized referral center underwent surgical exploration, 96% of whom had resection. SEER resection rates for esophageal cancer did not change between 1988 and 2004. Males were more likely to receive operative treatment. Nonwhites were less likely to undergo surgery than whites (odds ratio 0.45, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical therapy for locoregional esophageal cancer is likely underused. Racial variations in esophagectomy are significant. Referral to specialized centers may result in an increase in patients considered for surgical therapy.",cancer
"ZEB1-responsive genes in non-small cell lung cancer. The epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a developmental process enabling epithelial cells to gain a migratory mesenchymal phenotype. In cancer, this process contributes to metastases; however the regulatory signals and mechanistic details are not fully elucidated. Here, we sought to identify the subset of genes regulated in lung cancer by ZEB1, an E-box transcriptional repressor known to induce EMT. Using an Affymetrix-based expression database of 38 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we identified 324 genes that correlated negatively with ZEB1 and 142 that were positively correlated. A mesenchymal gene pattern (low E-cadherin, high Vimentin or N-cadherin) was significantly associated with ZEB1 and ZEB2, but not with Snail, Slug, Twist1 or Twist2. Among eight genes selected for validation, seven were confirmed to correlate with ZEB1 by quantitative real-time RT-PCR in a series of 22 NSCLC cell lines, either negatively (CDS1, EpCAM, ESRP1, ESRP2, ST14) or positively (FGFR1, Vimentin). In addition, over-expression or knockdown of ZEB1 led to corresponding changes in gene expression, demonstrating that these genes are also regulated by ZEB1, either directly or indirectly. Of note, the combined knockdown of ZEB1 and ZEB2 led to apparent synergistic responses in gene expression. Furthermore, these responses were not restricted to artificial settings, since most genes were similarly regulated during a physiologic induction of EMT by TGF-beta plus EGF. Finally, the absence of ST14 (matriptase) was linked to ZEB1 positivity in lung cancer tissue microarrays, implying that the regulation observed in vitro applies to the human disease. In summary, this study identifies a new set of ZEB-regulated genes in human lung cancer cells and supports the hypothesis that ZEB1 and ZEB2 are key regulators of the EMT process in this disease.",cancer
"Resolution of mesangial light chain deposits 3 years after high-dose melphalan with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. A 52-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for treatment of nephrotic syndrome. Funduscopic findings showed fundal hemorrhage and soft exudates, and serologic analysis showed a monoclonal serum component that was identified as Bence Jones protein-k type. A bone marrow biopsy showed diffuse proliferation of atypical plasma cells, while a renal biopsy showed diffuse and nodular mesangial proliferation. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the presence of k chains along the glomerular basement membrane and in mesangial areas. The patient was diagnosed as multiple myeloma (Bence Jones k type) with light chain deposition disease (LCDD). After high-dose melphalan and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), the multiple myeloma and nephrotic syndrome were in complete remission; her renal function was improved, but a renal biopsy performed 6 months after PBSCT showed the persistence of diffuse and nodular lesions. By contrast, a renal biopsy performed 3 years later showed complete resolution of the diffuse and nodular mesangial proliferation.",cancer

To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of chemotherapy triggering pneumothoraces in a woman with lymphangioleiomyomatosis.",cancer
"Radiation dose to patients and clinicians during fluoroscopically-guided biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions. BACKGROUND: Fluoroscopic guidance may be utilized in some bronchoscopic procedures, including ultrasound-guided bronchoscopy for investigation of peripheral pulmonary lesions. Some authors have suggested this procedure may be performed without fluoroscopy, to minimize risks due to radiation exposure. However, the radiation dose has never been quantified, so the risk remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To determine the patient and clinician radiation exposure from fluoroscopy during bronchoscopy. METHODS: We recorded exposure parameters during 45 consecutive ultrasound bronchoscopies with fluoroscopic guidance with a mobile C-arm fluoroscopy system. We calculated the patient effective radiation dose with Monte Carlo computer simulations. Passive personal film dosimeters were placed on 4 sites on both the proceduralist and the primary nursing assistant. RESULTS: The mean fluoroscopy screening time was 96 +/- 55 s. Patients received a median effective radiation dose of 0.49 +/- 0.37 milli-Sieverts (mSv) (range 0.16-1.3 mSv). Only the film dosimeters worn outside the clinicians' protective aprons recorded measurable radiation doses. Based on typical attenuation properties of the protective garments across the diagnostic x-ray energy range, we estimate that the effective radiation dose per procedure to the proceduralist was 0.4 micro-Sieverts (muSv) and to the assistant was 0.2 muSv. CONCLUSIONS: Patients are exposed to relatively small amounts of radiation from fluoroscopy during bronchoscopy. Clinically indicated fluoroscopic guidance during bronchoscopy should not be precluded on the basis of radiation safety concerns. Adequate shielding of clinicians results in negligible radiation doses during ultrasound bronchoscopy.",cancer
"EML4-ALK mutations in lung cancer that confer resistance to ALK inhibitors. The EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4)-ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) fusion-type tyrosine kinase is an oncoprotein found in 4 to 5% of non-small-cell lung cancers, and clinical trials of specific inhibitors of ALK for the treatment of such tumors are currently under way. Here, we report the discovery of two secondary mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK in tumor cells isolated from a patient during the relapse phase of treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Each mutation developed independently in subclones of the tumor and conferred marked resistance to two different ALK inhibitors.

"Crizotinib in ALK-rearranged inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a distinctive mesenchymal neoplasm characterized by a spindle-cell proliferation with an inflammatory infiltrate. Approximately half of IMTs carry rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) locus on chromosome 2p23, causing aberrant ALK expression. We report a sustained partial response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066, Pfizer) in a patient with ALK-translocated IMT, as compared with no observed activity in another patient without the ALK translocation. These results support the dependence of ALK-rearranged tumors on ALK-mediated signaling and suggest a therapeutic strategy for genomically identified patients with the aggressive form of this soft-tissue tumor.

"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibition in non-small-cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: Oncogenic fusion genes consisting of EML4 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are present in a subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancers, representing 2 to 7% of such tumors. We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. METHODS: After screening tumor samples from approximately 1500 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer for the presence of ALK rearrangements, we identified 82 patients with advanced ALK-positive disease who were eligible for the clinical trial. Most of the patients had received previous treatment. These patients were enrolled in an expanded cohort study instituted after phase 1 dose escalation had established a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy. RESULTS: Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements, and most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco and had adenocarcinomas. At a mean treatment duration of 6.4 months, the overall response rate was 57% (47 of 82 patients, with 46 confirmed partial responses and 1 confirmed complete response); 27 patients (33%) had stable disease. A total of 63 of 82 patients (77%) were continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of data cutoff, and the estimated probability of 6-month progression-free survival was 72%, with no median for the study reached. The drug resulted in grade 1 or 2 (mild) gastrointestinal side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The inhibition of ALK in lung tumors with the ALK rearrangement resulted in tumor shrinkage or stable disease in most patients.

"The science and practice of bone health in oncology: managing bone loss and metastasis in patients with solid tumors. Cancer and its treatment can compromise bone health, leading to fracture, pain, loss of mobility, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Bone metastasis occurs frequently in advanced prostate and breast cancers, and bony manifestations are commonplace in multiple myeloma. Osteoporosis and osteopenia may be consequences of androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, aromatase inhibition for breast cancer, or chemotherapy-induced ovarian failure. Osteoporotic bone loss and bone metastasis ultimately share a pathophysiologic pathway that stimulates bone resorption by increasing the formation and activity of osteoclasts. Important mediators of pathologic bone metabolism include substances produced by osteoblasts, such as RANKL, the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand, which spurs osteoclast differentiation from myeloid cells. Available therapies are targeted to various steps in cascade of bone metastasis.",cancer
"Sex chromosome changes after sex-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation can mislead the chimerism analysis. A 12-year-old male with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia with cryptic BCR/ABL rearrangement underwent sex-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT). Contradictory results were provided by various chimerism analyses 3 months later. Y-chromosome-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sex chromosome-specific interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (i-FISH) showed complete donor chimerism. Analysis of autosomal short tandem repeats (A-STR), BCR/ABL i-FISH test, and X-STR haplotype indicated relapse. Metaphase-FISH and combined BCR/ABL and sex chromosome-specific i-FISH patterns revealed loss of the Y-chromosome and duplication of the X-chromosome in the host cells. Sex chromosome changes after allo-BMT can cause significant difficulties in chimerism analysis.",cancer
"Evaluation of cytarabine against Ewing sarcoma xenografts by the pediatric preclinical testing program. Treatment with the nucleoside analog cytarabine has been shown to mimic changes in gene expression associated with downregulation of the EWS-FLI1 oncogene in Ewing sarcoma cell lines, selectively inhibit their growth in vitro, and cause tumor regression in athymic nude mice. For this report cytarabine was studied in vitro against a panel of 23 pediatric cancer cell lines and in vivo against 6 Ewing sarcoma xenografts. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines were the most sensitive to cytarabine in vitro (median IC(50) 9 nM), while Ewing sarcoma cell lines showed intermediate sensitivity (median IC(50) 232 nM). Cytarabine at a dose of 150 mg/kg administered daily 5x failed to significantly inhibit growth of five xenograft models, but reduced growth rate of the A673 xenograft by 50%. Cytarabine shows no differential in vitro activity against Ewing sarcoma cell lines and is ineffective in vivo against Ewing sarcoma xenografts at the dose and schedule studied.",cancer

"Presumptive treatment for malaria is not justified in children receiving cancer chemotherapy. BACKGROUND: Predominant etiologies of febrile neutropenia (FN) during the course of cancer chemotherapy include infections with bacteria, fungi, and viruses. Infection with malarial parasite is a possibility in regions that are endemic for malaria. Over-diagnosis and over-treatment of malaria is increasingly being recognized as a serious concern in malaria endemic regions. Aim was to determine the incidence of malarial infection in episodes of FN in children receiving chemotherapy for malignant disorders. METHODS: Children, with malignant disorders, on chemotherapy, who fulfilled the definition of FN were enrolled prospectively. Standard microscopy, quantitative buffy coat, and antigen detection (OptiMAL) were performed in each episode of FN. RESULTS: One hundred episodes of FN involving 82 children were investigated. The age ranged from 2 to 13 years (mean: 5.8 +/- 2.8). Eighty-one episodes were in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 15 in acute myeloid leukemia, and remaining 4 in other malignancies. Evidence for malaria was not found in any case by any of the three methods. CONCLUSIONS: Malaria was not found to be a causative agent for FN in children with various malignant disorders, in a region with low endemicity for malaria. Presumptive administration of antimalarials in children with FN is unjustified. Pediatric oncologists constantly face the challenge of managing febrile illnesses in immunocompromised patients. Those practicing in malaria endemic regions can effectively exploit diagnostic tools for malaria for a rational decision.",cancer
"Optic pathway glioma: long-term visual outcome in children without neurofibromatosis type-1. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the visual outcome of children affected by an optic pathway glioma (OPG). PROCEDURES: We evaluated the long-term visual outcome of 32 consecutive children affected by OPG without neurofibromatosis type-1 referred to the Pediatric Department of Padua University and managed according to standardized strategies. RESULTS: Eight children received chemotherapy, 10 radiotherapy, 7 both chemotherapy and radiotherapy, whereas 7 were untreated. At presentation, visual acuity (VA) was normal in 22 children (13 unilaterally and 9 bilaterally), and reduced in 10. At follow-up, VA had improved in 6 patients; it was stable in 8 and worse in 18. Visual field, assessed in 29 children, was normal in 9 and reduced in 20. The number of children with some grade of visual impairment increased from 7 to 10 during follow-up. Of the 17 children in whom the tumor became significantly smaller, VA improved in 6, was stable in 3, and worse in 8. Of the 6 children with improved VA, 5 received radiotherapy, and their papilla was normal or mildly pale. After a median follow-up of 6 years, 26 patients are alive with stable disease. CONCLUSIONS: The visual prognosis of children with OPG is unsatisfactory. Older children treated with radiotherapy seem to have a better visual outcome than younger children. Severe optic pallor at diagnosis or during follow-up may be indicative of a negative prognosis.",cancer
"PET imaging for pediatric oncology: an assessment of the evidence. Positron emission tomography (PET) has shown potential benefits when used in therapeutic clinical trials for children with cancer.

"Expanding options to improve outcomes following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers a curative option for children with a number of potentially lethal malignant and non-malignant conditions. Decisions regarding the appropriateness of HSCT for a given patient involve careful consideration of the risks associated with HSCT and the likelihood of cure. This is particularly important as the procedure is being used with increasing frequency for diagnoses such as high-risk sickle cell anemia where the disease is associated with shortened lifespan but death generally occurs in adulthood. Recent advances in supportive care such as improved anti-microbial agents, the use of reduced intensity conditioning regimens and high-resolution HLA typing that allows for better donor selection have all contributed to improved outcomes. However, the risk of treatment-related mortality remains approximately 5-10%, in part due to complications such as veno-occlusive disease (VOD) for which there has been less progress.",cancer
"Clinical features, molecular diagnosis, and treatment outcome of infants with leukemia in Taiwan. BACKGROUND: Infant leukemia is rare and quite distinct from other childhood leukemias. Differentiating between leukemia and transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) in phenotypically normal infants is sometimes difficult. The clinical features and molecular analyses for the fusion transcripts of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangement in infant leukemia have not been well documented in the Chinese population. PROCEDURE: Forty-five consecutive infants diagnosed with leukemia between 1995 and 2007 in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan were studied. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was diagnosed in 23 infants, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in 21 (including TMD in 4), and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) in 1. RESULTS: The median white count at diagnosis was higher in ALL than in AML (154.4 x 10(9)/l vs. 58.3 x 10(9)/l, P = 0.05). Chromosome 11q23/MLL abnormalities were present in 77% of ALL and 31% of AML. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) in infant ALL and AML showed no difference (18% vs. 12%, respectively). The only independent predictor of an adverse prognosis among infants diagnosed with ALL was high presenting white count >/= 100 x 10(9)/l (P = 0.05). However, no factor was associated with an adverse outcome for infants with AML. CONCLUSIONS: The molecular assessments and prognostic factors of infant leukemia in Taiwan mirror those in developed Western countries. Continued molecular investigations and development of more effective therapies are needed.",cancer
"Quality management and accreditation of research tissue banks: experience of the National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT) Heidelberg. Tissue banks are key resource and technology platforms in biomedical research that address the molecular pathogenesis of diseases as well as disease prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Due to the central role of tissue banks in standardized collection, storage, and distribution of human tissues and their derivatives, quality management and its external assessment is becoming increasingly relevant for the maintenance, acceptance, and funding of tissue banks. Little experience exists regarding formalized external evaluation of tissue banks, especially regarding certification and accreditation. Based on the accreditation of the National Center of Tumor Diseases (NCT) tissue bank in Heidelberg (Germany), criteria, requirements, processes, and implications were compiled and evaluated. Accreditation formally approved professional competence and performance of the tissue bank in all steps involved in tissue collection, storage, handling as well as macroscopic and histologic examination and final (exit) examination of the tissue and transfer supervised by board-certified competent histopathologists. Thereby, accreditation provides a comprehensive measure to evaluate and document the quality standard of tissue research banks and may play a significant role in the future assessment of tissue banks. Furthermore, accreditation may support harmonization and standardization of tissue banking for biomedical research purposes.",cancer
"Pancreatic neuroma-like lesions after upper abdominal surgery: a clinicopathological postmortem study. To elucidate poorly understood pancreatic neural changes after upper abdominal surgery (UAS), we histologically examined 57 postmortem pancreases after gastrectomy, esophagectomy, and esophageal transection, and also investigated each clinical manifestation. Six pancreases (10.5%) had unique histopathological lesions composed of prominently thickened and/or proliferated neural fascicles. They focally or multifocally involved the pancreatic lobules and/or interlobular septa and mimicked traumatic neuroma. Three of the six lesions were accompanied by moderate to severe chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic fibrosis. All six patients were asymptomatic, although only one exhibited a low-echoic pancreatic mass. There were no statistically significant associations between the pancreatic neural lesions and the patients' sex, age, the time interval between the surgery and the patients' death, impaired glucose tolerance, the presence of hyalinized pancreatic islets, or the presence of moderate to severe chronic pancreatitis/pancreatic fibrosis. No similar prominent neural lesions were identified in an additional 57 age- and sex-matched control pancreases. We concluded that these prominent neural lesions were pancreatic neuroma-like lesions following UAS. This study failed to demonstrate the distinct pathogenesis of the neuroma-like lesions and further investigation may be needed. However, this report is the first to delineate that asymptomatic neuroma-like lesions can occur following UAS. Consideration of this possible development would be useful for accurate follow-up of patients who undergo UAS, although its occurrence may be infrequent.",cancer
"A systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between body size and testicular cancer. BACKGROUND: Studies assessing the relationships of anthropometry and testicular germ-cell tumour (TGCT) have reported heterogeneous findings. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between adult height, weight, body mass index (BMI), and testicular cancer. Search strategies were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science on 26 May 2009. Studies that met our inclusion criteria were included in meta-analytic models using STATA 11. RESULTS: A total of 3255 references were retrieved, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. Random effects meta-analysis found adult height (odds ratio (OR) per 5-cm increase 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-1.19, P<0.001) and weight (OR overweight vs normal 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.98, P=0.011) to be associated with TGCT. The meta-analysis of weight and TGCT produced a summary estimate, which indicated no association, although an analysis restricted studies to North American was suggestive of association (OR per 1-kg increase 1.01, 95% CI 1.00-1.01, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis has found evidence for a positive association of adult height and TGCT, and tentative evidence for an inverse association of BMI and TGCT.",cancer
"Pathological complete response and survival according to the level of HER-2 amplification after trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer. BACKGROUND: We analysed whether the level of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) amplification significantly influenced either pathological complete response (pCR) or recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) after trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS: In all, 99 patients with an HER-2-amplified breast tumour treated with trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy were included. Tumours were classified as low amplified (LA; 6-10 signals per nuclei) or highly amplified (HA; >10 signals). Pathological response was assessed according to Chevallier's classification (pCR was defined as grade 1 or 2). Median follow-up lasted 46 months (6-83). Cox uni- and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: In all, 33 tumour samples were LA and 66 were HA. The pCR in HA tumours was significantly higher than in LA tumours (55% vs 24%, P=0.005), whereas no association was found between the pCR rate and tumour stage, grade or hormone receptor status. In multivariate analysis, the pathological nodal status (P=0.005) and adjuvant trastuzumab (P=0.037) were independently associated with RFS, whereas the level of HER-2 amplification nearly reached statistical significance (P=0.057). There was no significant difference between LA and HA tumours for OS (P=0.22, log-rank). CONCLUSION: The level of HER-2 gene amplification significantly influenced pCR but not RFS or OS in non-metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy. However, RFS in patients with HA tumours tended to be shorter.",cancer
"Maternal vitamin and iron supplementation and risk of infant leukaemia: a report from the Children's Oncology Group. BACKGROUND: Prenatal supplementation has been inversely associated with childhood, but not with infant, leukaemia. METHODS: Mothers of 443 cases of infant leukaemia diagnosed during 1996-2006 and 324 frequency-matched controls completed interviews. Associations were evaluated by unconditional logistic regression. RESULTS: We observed no associations between prenatal vitamin (odds ratio (OR)=0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.44-1.42) or iron supplementation (OR=1.07, 95% CI: 0.75-1.52) and infant leukaemia after adjustment for race/ethnicity and income. Similar results were observed for leukaemia subtypes analysed separately. CONCLUSION: The observed null associations may be attributable to high supplementation rates and/or national fortification programmes.",cancer
"A 50% higher prevalence of life-shortening chronic conditions among cancer patients with low socioeconomic status. BACKGROUND: Comorbidity and socioeconomic status (SES) may be related among cancer patients. METHOD: Population-based cancer registry study among 72,153 patients diagnosed during 1997-2006. RESULTS: Low SES patients had 50% higher risk of serious comorbidity than those with high SES. Prevalence was increased for each cancer site. Low SES cancer patients had significantly higher risk of also having cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, tuberculosis, dementia, and gastrointestinal disease. One-year survival was significantly worse in lowest vs highest SES, partly explained by comorbidity. CONCLUSION: This illustrates the enormous heterogeneity of cancer patients and stresses the need for optimal treatment of cancer patients with a variety of concomitant chronic conditions.",cancer
"Inhibition of renin-angiotensin system affects prognosis of advanced pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine. BACKGROUND: The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is thought to have a role in carcinogenesis, and RAS inhibition may prevent tumour growth. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated the impact of angiotensin I-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II type-1 receptor blockers (ARBs) in 155 patients with pancreatic cancer receiving gemcitabine monotherapy. Patients were divided into three groups: the ACEI/ARB group (27 patients receiving an ACEI or ARB for hypertension (HT)), the non-ACEI/ARB with HT group (25 patients receiving antihypertensive drugs other than ACEIs or ARBs), and the non-HT group (103 patients receiving no antihypertensive drugs). RESULTS: Patient characteristics were not different, except for age and HT medications. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 8.7 months in the ACEI/ARB group, 4.5 months in the non-ACEI/ARB with HT group, and 3.6 months in the non-HT group. Overall survival (OS) was 15.1 months in the ACEI/ARB group, 8.9 months in the non-ACEI/ARB with HT group, and 9.5 months in the non-HT group. The use of ACEIs/ARBs was a significant prognostic factor for both PFS (P=0.032) and OS (P=0.014) in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The ACEIs/ARBs in combination with gemcitabine might improve clinical outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Prospective trials are needed to test this hypothesis.",cancer
"Increased NOS2 predicts poor survival in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer patients. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) is involved in wound healing, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis. NOS2 upregulation and increased nitric oxide (NO) production affect the redox state of cells and can induce protein, lipid, and DNA modifications. To investigate whether NOS2 levels influence survival of breast cancer patients, we examined NOS2 expression and its association with tumor markers and survival in 248 breast tumors. In multivariable survival analysis, increased NOS2 predicted inferior survival in women with estrogen receptor alpha-negative (ER-negative) tumors. Microdissected tumor epithelium from ER-negative tumors with high NOS2 had increased IL-8 and a gene expression signature characteristic of basal-like breast cancer with poor prognosis. In cell culture, NO only induced selected signature genes in ER-negative breast cancer cells. ER transgene expression in ER-negative cells inhibited NO-induced upregulation of the stem cell marker CD44 and other proteins encoded by signature genes, but not of IL-8. Exposure to NO also enhanced cell motility and invasion of ER-negative cells. Last, pathway analysis linked the tumor NOS2 gene signature to c-Myc activation. Thus, NOS2 is associated with a basal-like transcription pattern and poor survival of ER-negative patients.",cancer
"The cyclin E regulator cullin 3 prevents mouse hepatic progenitor cells from becoming tumor-initiating cells. Cyclin E is often overexpressed in cancer tissue, leading to genetic instability and aneuploidy. Cullin 3 (Cul3) is a component of the BTB-Cul3-Rbx1 (BCR) ubiquitin ligase that is involved in the turnover of cyclin E. Here we show that liver-specific ablation of Cul3 in mice results in the persistence and massive expansion of hepatic progenitor cells. Upon induction of differentiation, Cul3-deficient progenitor cells underwent substantial DNA damage in vivo and in vitro, thereby triggering the activation of a cellular senescence response that selectively blocked the expansion of the differentiated offspring. Positive selection of undifferentiated progenitor cells required the expression of the tumor suppressor protein p53. Simultaneous loss of Cul3 and p53 in hepatic progenitors turned these cells into highly malignant tumor-initiating cells that formed largely undifferentiated tumors in nude mice. In addition, loss of Cul3 and p53 led to the formation of primary hepatocellular carcinomas. Importantly, loss of Cul3 expression was also detected in a large series of human liver cancers and correlated directly with tumor de-differentiation. The expression of Cul3 during hepatic differentiation therefore safeguards against the formation of progenitor cells that carry a great potential for transformation into tumor-initiating cells.",cancer
"Gene therapy using genetically modified lymphocytes targeting VEGFR-2 inhibits the growth of vascularized syngenic tumors in mice. Immunotherapies based on adoptive cell transfer are highly effective in the treatment of metastatic melanoma, but the use of this approach in other cancer histologies has been hampered by the identification of appropriate target molecules. Immunologic approaches targeting tumor vasculature provide a means for the therapy of multiple solid tumor types. We developed a method to target tumor vasculature, using genetically redirected syngeneic or autologous T cells. Mouse and human T cells were engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) targeted against VEGFR-2, which is overexpressed in tumor vasculature and is responsible for VEGF-mediated tumor progression and metastasis. Mouse and human T cells expressing the relevant VEGFR-2 CARs mediated specific immune responses against VEGFR-2 protein as well as VEGFR-2-expressing cells in vitro. A single dose of VEGFR-2 CAR-engineered mouse T cells plus exogenous IL-2 significantly inhibited the growth of 5 different types of established, vascularized syngeneic tumors in 2 different strains of mice and prolonged the survival of mice. T cells transduced with VEGFR-2 CAR showed durable and increased tumor infiltration, correlating with their antitumor effect. This approach provides a potential method for the gene therapy of a variety of human cancers.",cancer
"The cytomegalovirus-encoded chemokine receptor US28 promotes intestinal neoplasia in transgenic mice. US28 is a constitutively active chemokine receptor encoded by CMV (also referred to as human herpesvirus 5), a highly prevalent human virus that infects a broad spectrum of cells, including intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). To study the role of US28 in vivo, we created transgenic mice (VS28 mice) in which US28 expression was targeted to IECs. Expression of US28 was detected in all IECs of the small and large intestine, including in cells expressing leucine rich repeat containing GPCR5 (Lgr5), a marker gene of intestinal epithelial stem cells. US28 expression in IECs inhibited glycogen synthase 3beta (GSK-3beta) function, promoted accumulation of beta-catenin protein, and increased expression of Wnt target genes involved in the control of the cell proliferation. VS28 mice showed a hyperplastic intestinal epithelium and, strikingly, developed adenomas and adenocarcinomas by 40 weeks of age. When exposed to an inflammation-driven tumor model (azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate), VS28 mice developed a significantly higher tumor burden than control littermates. Transgenic coexpression of the US28 ligand CCL2 (an inflammatory chemokine) increased IEC proliferation as well as tumor burden, suggesting that the oncogenic activity of US28 can be modulated by inflammatory factors. Together, these results indicate that expression of US28 promotes development of intestinal dysplasia and cancer in transgenic mice and suggest that CMV infection may facilitate development of intestinal neoplasia in humans.",cancer
"Association of KRAS p.G13D mutation with outcome in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab. CONTEXT: Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who have KRAS codon 12- or KRAS codon 13-mutated tumors are presently excluded from treatment with the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that KRAS codon 13 mutations are associated with a better outcome after treatment with cetuximab than observed with other KRAS mutations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We studied the association between KRAS mutation status (p.G13D vs other KRAS mutations) and response and survival in a pooled data set of 579 patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab between 2001 and 2008. Patients were included in the CO.17, BOND, MABEL, EMR202600, EVEREST, BABEL, or SALVAGE clinical trials or received off-study treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses, adjusting for possible prognostic factors and data set, were performed. The effect of the different mutations was studied in vitro by constructing isogenic cell lines with wild-type KRAS, p.G12V, or p.G13D mutant alleles and treating them with cetuximab. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main efficacy end point was overall survival. Secondary efficacy end points were response rate and progression-free survival. RESULTS: In comparison with patients with other KRAS-mutated tumors, patients with p.G13D-mutated tumors (n = 32) treated with cetuximab had longer overall survival (median, 7.6 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 5.7-20.5] months vs 5.7 [95% CI, 4.9-6.8] months; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.81; P = .005) and longer progression-free survival (median, 4.0 [95% CI, 1.9-6.2] months vs 1.9 [95% CI, 1.8-2.8] months; adjusted HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81; P = .004). There was a significant interaction between KRAS mutation status (p.G13D vs other KRAS mutations) and overall survival benefit with cetuximab treatment (adjusted HR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14-0.67; P = .003). In vitro and mouse model analysis showed that although p.G12V-mutated colorectal cells were insensitive to cetuximab, p.G13D-mutated cells were sensitive, as were KRAS wild-type cells. CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis, use of cetuximab was associated with longer overall and progression-free survival among patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer with p.G13D-mutated tumors than with other KRAS-mutated tumors. Evaluation of cetuximab therapy in these tumors in prospective randomized trials may be warranted.",cancer
"In vivo imaging of inflammation- and tumor-induced lymph node lymphangiogenesis by immuno-positron emission tomography. Metastasis to regional lymph nodes (LN) is a prognostic indicator for cancer progression. There is a great demand for sensitive and noninvasive methods to detect metastasis to LNs. Whereas conventional in vivo imaging approaches have focused on the detection of cancer cells, lymphangiogenesis within tumor-draining LNs might be the earliest sign of metastasis. In mouse models of LN lymphangiogenesis, we found that systemically injected antibodies to lymphatic epitopes accumulated in the lymphatic vasculature in tissues and LNs. Using a (124)I-labeled antibody against the lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor-1 (LYVE-1), we imaged, for the first time, inflammation- and tumor-draining LNs with expanded lymphatic networks in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). Anti-LYVE-1 immuno-PET enabled visualization of lymphatic vessel expansion in LNs bearing metastases that were not detected by [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, which is clinically applied to detect cancer metastases. Immuno-PET with lymphatic-specific antibodies may open up new avenues for the early detection of metastasis, and the images obtained might be used as biomarkers for the progression of diseases associated with lymphangiogenesis.",cancer
"EGFR promotes lung tumorigenesis by activating miR-7 through a Ras/ERK/Myc pathway that targets the Ets2 transcriptional repressor ERF. MicroRNAs (miRNA) mediate distinct gene regulatory pathways triggered by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation, which occurs commonly in lung cancers with poor prognosis. In this study, we report the discovery and mechanistic characterization of the miRNA miR-7 as an oncogenic ""oncomiR"" and its role as a key mediator of EGFR signaling in lung cancer cells. EGFR activation or ectopic expression of Ras as well as c-Myc stimulated miR-7 expression in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent manner, suggesting that EGFR induces miR-7 expression through a Ras/ERK/Myc pathway. In support of this likelihood, c-Myc bound to the miR-7 promoter and enhanced its activity. Ectopic miR-7 promoted cell growth and tumor formation in lung cancer cells, significantly increasing the mortality of nude mice hosts, which were orthotopically implanted with lung cancers. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that miR-7 decreased levels of the Ets2 transcriptional repression factor ERF, the coding sequence of which was found to contain a miR-7 complementary sequence. Indeed, ectopic miR-7 inhibited production of ERF messages with a wild-type but not a silently mutated coding sequence, and ectopic miR-7 rescued growth arrest produced by wild-type but not mutated ERF. Together, these results identified that ERF is a direct target of miR-7 in lung cancer. Our findings suggest that miR-7 may act as an important modulator of EGFR-mediated oncogenesis, with potential applications as a novel prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in lung cancer.",cancer
"Heparanase enhances local and systemic osteolysis in multiple myeloma by upregulating the expression and secretion of RANKL. Excessive bone destruction is a major cause of morbidity in myeloma patients. However, the biological mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of myeloma-induced bone disease are not fully understood. Heparanase, an enzyme that cleaves the heparan sulfate chains of proteoglycans, is upregulated in a variety of human tumors, including multiple myeloma. We previously showed that heparanase promotes robust myeloma tumor growth and supports spontaneous metastasis of tumor cells to bone. In the present study, we show, for the first time, that the expression of heparanase by myeloma tumor cells remarkably enhances bone destruction locally within the tumor microenvironment. In addition, enhanced heparanase expression in the primary tumor also stimulated systemic osteoclastogenesis and osteolysis, thus mimicking the systemic osteoporosis often seen in myeloma patients. These effects occur, at least in part, as the result of a significant elevation in the expression and secretion of receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) by heparanase-expressing myeloma cells. Moreover, analysis of bone marrow biopsies from myeloma patients reveals a positive correlation between the level of expression of heparanase and RANKL. Together, these discoveries reveal a novel and key role for heparanase in promoting tumor osteolysis and show that RANKL is central to the mechanism of heparanase-mediated osteolysis in myeloma.",cancer
"Nuclear receptor COUP-TFII controls pancreatic islet tumor angiogenesis by regulating vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 signaling. The significance of angiogenesis in cancer biology and therapy is well established. In this study, we used the prototypical RIP-Tag model of multistage pancreatic islet tumorigenesis to show that the nuclear receptor COUP-TFII is essential to regulate the balance between pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules that influence the angiogenic switch in cancer. Conditional ablation of COUP-TFII in the tumor microenvironment severely compromised neoangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis during pancreatic tumor progression and metastasis. We found that COUP-TFII plays a cell-autonomous role in endothelial cells to control blood vessel sprouting by regulating cell proliferation and migration. Mechanistic investigations revealed that COUP-TFII suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) signaling by transcriptionally repressing the expression of VEGFR-1, thereby curtailing a central angiogenic driver of vascular growth. Taken together, our results implicate COUP-TFII as a critical factor in tumor angiogenesis through regulation of VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling, suggesting COUP-TFII as a candidate target for antiangiogenic therapy.",cancer
"A major role of p95/611-CTF, a carboxy-terminal fragment of HER2, in the down-modulation of the estrogen receptor in HER2-positive breast cancers. Current classification of breast cancers depends in great part on the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, and estrogen receptor (ER), the nuclear receptor for estrogen. In addition to reliable biomarkers, these receptors are targets of effective and widely used antitumor drugs. During malignant progression, HER2 and ER can establish an intricate cross-talk. In some cases, HER2 overexpression leads to the downregulation of ER and undermining of anti-ER therapies. A subgroup of HER2-positive breast cancer patients with poor prognosis expresses a heterogeneous collection of HER2 carboxy-terminal fragments (CTF) collectively known as p95HER2. One of these fragments, 611-CTF, is oncogenic in a variety of preclinical models. However, because of the lack of an appropriate tool to specifically analyze its levels in the clinical setting, the value of 611-CTF as a biomarker has not been established yet. Here, we show that 611-CTF induces resistance to antiestrogen therapy and a more pronounced down-modulation of ER than that induced by full-length HER2. To validate this effect in breast cancer samples, we developed specific anti-611-CTF antibodies. With these antibodies, we showed that, whereas the frequency of ER positivity in HER2-positive/611-CTF-negative tumors (72.6%) is similar to that reported for HER2-negative tumors (70-80%), the number of ER-positive tumors in the 611-CTF-positive subgroup is very low (31.2%). These results reveal a mechanism of ER regulation mediated by HER2, which suggests a new strategy to improve responses to endocrine therapy in breast cancer.",cancer
"Differential effects of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 inhibition on tumor metastases based on host organ environment. Tumors induce new blood vessel growth primarily from host organ microvascular endothelial cells (EC), and microvasculature differs significantly between the lung and liver. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF or VEGF-A) promotion of tumor angiogenesis is thought to be mediated primarily by VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2). In this study, VEGFR-2 antibody (DC101) inhibited growth of RenCa renal cell carcinoma lung metastases by 26%, whereas VEGFR-1 antibody (MF-1) had no effect. However, VEGFR-2 neutralization had no effect on RenCa liver metastases, whereas VEGFR-1 neutralization decreased RenCa liver metastases by 31%. For CT26 colon carcinoma liver metastases, inhibition of both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 was required to induce growth delay. VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 inhibition decreased tumor burden not by preventing the establishment of micrometastases but rather by preventing vascularization and growth of micrometastases by 55% and 43%, respectively. VEGF induced greater phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in lung ECs and of VEGFR-1 in liver ECs. EC proliferation, migration, and capillary tube formation in vitro were suppressed more by VEGFR-2 inhibition for lung EC and more by VEGFR-1 inhibition for liver EC. Collectively, our results indicate that liver metastases are more reliant on VEGFR-1 than lung metastases to mediate angiogenesis due to differential activity of VEGFRs on liver EC versus lung EC. Thus, therapies inhibiting specific VEGFRs should consider the targeted sites of metastatic disease.",cancer
"Targeted radiosensitization of cells expressing truncated DNA polymerase {beta}. Ionizing radiation (IR) is an effective anticancer treatment, although failures still occur. To improve radiotherapy, tumor-targeted strategies are needed to increase radiosensitivity of tumor cells, without influencing normal tissue radiosensitivity. Base excision repair (BER) and single-strand break repair (SSBR) contribute to the determination of sensitivity to IR. A crucial protein in BER/SSBR is DNA polymerase beta (polbeta). Aberrant polbeta expression is commonly found in human tumors and leads to inhibition of BER. Here, we show that truncated polbeta variant (polbeta-Delta)-expressing cells depend on homologous recombination (HR) for survival after IR, indicating that a considerable fraction of polbeta-Delta-induced lesions are subject to repair by HR. Increased sensitization was found not to result from involvement in DNA-dependent protein kinase-dependent nonhomologous end joining, the other major double-strand break repair pathway. Caffeine and the ATM inhibitor Ku55933 cause polbeta-Delta-dependent radiosensitization. Consistent with the observed HR dependence and the known HR-modulating activity of ATM, polbeta-Delta-expressing cells showed increased radiosensitization after BRCA2 knockdown that is absent under ATM-inhibited conditions. Our data suggest that treatment with HR modulators is a promising therapeutic strategy for exploiting defects in the BER/SSBR pathway in human tumors.",cancer
"Characterization of a candidate tumor suppressor gene uroplakin 1A in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is increasing in incidence, but the knowledge of the genetic underpinnings of this disease remains limited. In this study, we identified the tetraspanin cell surface receptor uroplakin 1A (UPK1A) as a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG), and we investigated its function and mechanism in ESCC cells. UPK1A downregulation occurred in 68% of primary ESCCs examined, where it was correlated significantly with promoter hypermethylation (P < 0.05). Ectopic expression of UPK1A in ESCC cells inhibited cell proliferation, clonogenicity, cell motility, and tumor formation in nude mice. Mechanistic investigations suggested that these effects may be mediated by inhibiting nuclear translocation of beta-catenin and inactivation of its downstream targets, including cyclin-D1, c-jun, c-myc, and matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7). Cell cycle arrest elicited by UPK1A at the G(1)-S checkpoint was associated with downregulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 4, whereas metastasis suppression was associated with reduction of MMP7. These findings were consistent with evidence derived from clinical samples, where UPK1A downregulation was correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.009), stage (P = 0.015), and overall survival (P < 0.0001). Indeed, multivariate cyclooxygenase regression analysis showed that UPK1A was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. Taken together, our findings define a function for UPK1A as an important TSG in ESCC development.",cancer
"MicroRNA expression and clinical outcomes in patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy after complete resection of non-small cell lung carcinoma. This study determined whether expression levels of a panel of biologically relevant microRNAs can be used as prognostic or predictive biomarkers in patients who participated in the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial (IALT), the largest randomized study conducted to date of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with radically resected non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Expression of miR-21, miR-29b, miR-34a/b/c, miR-155, and let-7a was determined by quantitative real-time PCR in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 639 IALT patients. The prognostic and predictive values of microRNA expression for survival were studied using a Cox model, which included every factor used in the stratified randomization, clinicopathologic prognostic factors, and other factors statistically related to microRNA expression. Investigation of the expression pattern of microRNAs in situ was performed. We also analyzed the association of TP53 mutation status and miR-34a/b/c expression, epidermal growth factor receptor and KRAS mutation status, and miR-21 and Let-7a expression. Finally, the association of p16 and miR-29b expression was assessed. Overall, no significant association was found between any of the tested microRNAs and survival, with the exception of miR-21 for which a deleterious prognostic effect of lowered expression was suggested. Otherwise, no single or combinatorial microRNA expression profile predicted response to adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Together, our results indicate that the microRNA expression patterns examined were neither predictive nor prognostic in a large patient cohort with radically resected NSCLC, randomized to receive adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus follow-up only.",cancer
"Association of adherence to lifestyle recommendations and risk of colorectal cancer: a prospective Danish cohort study. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between a simple lifestyle index based on the recommendations for five lifestyle factors and the incidence of colorectal cancer, and to estimate the proportion of colorectal cancer cases attributable to lack of adherence to the recommendations. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: General population of Copenhagen and Aarhus, Denmark. PARTICIPANTS: 55 487 men and women aged 50-64 years at baseline (1993-7), not previously diagnosed with cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Risk of colorectal cancer in relation to points achieved in the lifestyle index (based on physical activity, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol intake, and diet (dietary fibre, energy percentage from fat, red and processed meat, and fruits and vegetables)) modelled through Cox regression. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9.9 years, 678 men and women had colorectal cancer diagnosed. After adjustment for potential confounders, each additional point achieved on the lifestyle index, corresponding to one additional recommendation that was met, was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer (incidence rate ratio 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.96). In this population an estimated total of 13% (95% CI 4% to 22%) of the colorectal cancer cases were attributable to lack of adherence to merely one additional recommendation among all participants except the healthiest. If all participants had followed the five recommendations 23% (9% to 37%) of the colorectal cancer cases might have been prevented. Results were similar for colon and rectal cancer, but only statistically significant for colon cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to the recommendations for physical activity, waist circumference, smoking, alcohol intake, and diet may reduce colorectal cancer risk considerably, and in this population 23% of the cases might be attributable to lack of adherence to the five lifestyle recommendations. The simple structure of the lifestyle index facilitates its use in public health practice.",cancer
"A decision aid to support informed choices about bowel cancer screening among adults with low education: randomised controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a decision aid designed for adults with low education and literacy can support informed choice and involvement in decisions about screening for bowel cancer. DESIGN: Randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Areas in New South Wales, Australia identified as socioeconomically disadvantaged (low education attainment, high unemployment, and unskilled occupations). PARTICIPANTS: 572 adults aged between 55 and 64 with low educational attainment, eligible for bowel cancer screening. INTERVENTION: Patient decision aid comprising a paper based interactive booklet (with and without a question prompt list) and a DVD, presenting quantitative risk information on the possible outcomes of screening using faecal occult blood testing compared with no testing. The control group received standard information developed for the Australian national bowel screening programme. All materials and a faecal occult blood test kit were posted directly to people's homes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Informed choice (adequate knowledge and consistency between attitudes and screening behaviour) and preferences for involvement in screening decisions. RESULTS: Participants who received the decision aid showed higher levels of knowledge than the controls; the mean score (maximum score 12) for the decision aid group was 6.50 (95% confidence interval 6.15 to 6.84) and for the control group was 4.10 (3.85 to 4.36; P<0.001). Attitudes towards screening were less positive in the decision aid group, with 51% of the participants expressing favourable attitudes compared with 65% of participants in the control group (14% difference, 95% confidence interval 5% to 23%; P=0.002). The participation rate for screening was reduced in the decision aid group: completion of faecal occult blood testing was 59% v 75% in the control group (16% difference, 8% to 24%; P=0.001). The decision aid increased the proportion of participants who made an informed choice, from 12% in the control group to 34% in the decision aid group (22% difference, 15% to 29%; P<0.001). More participants in the decision aid group had no decisional conflict about the screening decision compared with the controls (51% v 38%; P=0.02). The groups did not differ for general anxiety or worry about bowel cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored decision support information can be effective in supporting informed choices and greater involvement in decisions about faecal occult blood testing among adults with low levels of education, without increasing anxiety or worry about developing bowel cancer. Using a decision aid to make an informed choice may, however, lead to lower uptake of screening.

"The Sir Hans Krebs Lecture. How a lipid mediates tumour suppression. Delivered on 29 June 2010 at the 35th FEBS Congress in Gothenburg, Sweden. Phosphorylated derivatives of the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), known as phosphoinositides (PIs), regulate membrane-proximal cellular processes by recruiting specific protein effectors involved in cell signalling, membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal dynamics. Two PIs that are generated through the activities of distinct PI 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are of special interest in cancer research. PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), generated by class I PI3Ks, functions as tumour promotor by recruiting effectors involved in cell survival, proliferation, growth and motility. Conversely, there is evidence that PtdIns3P, generated by class III PI3K, functions in tumour suppression. Three subunits of the class III PI3K complex (Beclin 1, UVRAG and BIF-1) have been independently identified as tumour suppressors in mice and humans, and their mechanism of action in this context has been proposed to entail activation of autophagy, a catabolic pathway that is considered to mediate tumour suppression by scavenging damaged organelles that would otherwise cause DNA instability through the production of reactive oxygen species. Recent studies have revealed two additional functions of PtdIns3P that might contribute to its tumour suppressor activity. The first involves endosomal sorting and lysosomal downregulation of mitogenic receptors. The second involves regulation of cytokinesis, which is the final stage of cell division. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of tumour suppression mediated by class III PI3K and PtdIns3P will identify novel Achilles' heels of the cell's defence against tumourigenesis and will be useful in the search for prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers in cancer.",cancer
"Structure and function of human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (HAMLET)-type complexes. Human alpha-lactalbumin made lethal to tumor cells (HAMLET) and equine lysozyme with oleic acid (ELOA) are complexes consisting of protein and fatty acid that exhibit cytotoxic activities, drastically differing from the activity of their respective proteinaceous compounds. Since the discovery of HAMLET in the 1990s, a wealth of information has been accumulated, illuminating the structural, functional and therapeutic properties of protein complexes with oleic acid, which is summarized in this review. In vitro, both HAMLET and ELOA are produced by using ion-exchange columns preconditioned with oleic acid. However, the complex of human alpha-lactalbumin with oleic acid with the antitumor activity of HAMLET was found to be naturally present in the acidic fraction of human milk, where it was discovered by serendipity. Structural studies have shown that alpha-lactalbumin in HAMLET and lysozyme in ELOA are partially unfolded, 'molten-globule'-like, thereby rendering the complexes dynamic and in conformational exchange. HAMLET exists in the monomeric form, whereas ELOA mostly exists as oligomers and the fatty acid stoichiometry varies, with HAMLET holding an average of approximately five oleic acid molecules, whereas ELOA contains a considerably larger number (11- 48). Potent tumoricidal activity is found in both HAMLET and ELOA, and HAMLET has also shown strong potential as an antitumor drug in different in vivo animal models and clinical studies. The gain of new, beneficial function upon partial protein unfolding and fatty acid binding is a remarkable phenomenon, and may reflect a significant generic route of functional diversification of proteins via varying their conformational states and associated ligands.",cancer
"Natural and amyloid self-assembly of S100 proteins: structural basis of functional diversity. The S100 proteins are 10-12 kDa EF-hand proteins that act as central regulators in a multitude of cellular processes including cell survival, proliferation, differentiation and motility. Consequently, many S100 proteins are implicated and display marked changes in their expression levels in many types of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The structure and function of S100 proteins are modulated by metal ions via Ca(2+) binding through EF-hand motifs and binding of Zn(2+) and Cu(2+) at additional sites, usually at the homodimer interfaces. Ca(2+) binding modulates S100 conformational opening and thus promotes and affects the interaction with p53, the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts and Toll-like receptor 4, among many others. Structural plasticity also occurs at the quaternary level, where several S100 proteins self-assemble into multiple oligomeric states, many being functionally relevant. Recently, we have found that the S100A8/A9 proteins are involved in amyloidogenic processes in corpora amylacea of prostate cancer patients, and undergo metal-mediated amyloid oligomerization and fibrillation in vitro. Here we review the unique chemical and structural properties of S100 proteins that underlie the conformational changes resulting in their oligomerization upon metal ion binding and ultimately in functional control. The possibility that S100 proteins have intrinsic amyloid-forming capacity is also addressed, as well as the hypothesis that amyloid self-assemblies may, under particular physiological conditions, affect the S100 functions within the cellular milieu.",cancer
"Human papillomavirus type 16 variants in paired enrollment and follow-up cervical samples: implications for a proper understanding of type-specific persistent infections. Prospective studies of the persistence of human papillomavirus (HPV) variants are rare and typically small. We sequenced HPV-16 variants in longitudinal pairs of specimens from 86 women enrolled in the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study. A change of variants was identified in 4 women (4.7% [95% confidence interval, 1.3%-11.5%]). Among women with intervening HPV results (n = 60), a variant switch occurred in 2 of 11 who had evidence of intervening negativity for HPV-16, compared with 1 of 49 who consistently tested positive (P = .11). These results suggest the possibility that rare misclassification of transient infections as persistent infections occurs in natural history studies of type-specific HPV infections.",cancer
"Nonopioid anesthesia for awake craniotomy: a case report. Awake craniotomy is becoming more popular as a neurosurgical technique that allows for increased tumor resection and decreased postoperative neurologic morbidity. This technique, however, presents many challenges to both the neurosurgeon and anesthetist. An ASA class II, 37-year-old man with recurrent oligodendroglioma presented for repeated craniotomy. Prior craniotomy under general anesthesia resulted in residual neurologic deficits. An awake craniotomy was planned to allow for intraoperative testing for maximum tumor resection and avoidance of neurologic morbidity. The patient was sedated with propofol, and bupivacaine was infiltrated for placement of Mayfield tongs and skin incision. Following exposure of brain tissue, propofol infusion was discontinued to allow for patient cooperation during the procedure. Speech, motor, and sensory testing occurred during tumor resection until resection stopped after onset of weakness in the right arm. The propofol infusion was resumed while the cranium was closed and Mayfield tongs removed. The patient was awake, alert, oriented, and able to move all extremities but had residual weakness in the right forearm. Awake craniotomy requires appropriate patient selection, knowledge of the surgeon's skill, and a thorough anesthesia plan. This case report discusses the clinical and anesthetic management for awake craniotomy and reviews the literature.",cancer
"Laryngeal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor in a man: a case report. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a pseudosarcomatous lesion occurring in soft tissue and organs. It is known under a wide number of terms, such as inflammatory pseudotumor, plasma cell granuloma, pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferation. IMT is most commonly located in the lung, while laryngeal location is rarely described. Due to its biology it can be misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor. We present a case of IMT of larynx, recognized in time and treated with laser ablation. Our case demonstrates the importance of timely IMT recognition in order to avoid overtreatment. This diagnosis should also alert clinicians to close follow-up of these patients.",cancer

Having acknowledged the relatively favorable evolution of our patient's malignant disease, we were not deterred by its presence from pursuing surgical treatment of his aortic dissection.",cancer
"The role of the nutrition in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This paper aims at evaluating the role of improper nutrition in the pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Barrett's oesophagus (BE), and oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EADC). It also tries to examine the influence of the alcohol, nicotine and coffee consumption in the development of the mentioned diseases. There were 180 subjects included in the trial, 109 males and 71 females, which were divided in the four groups (70 patients with GERD, 20 patients with BE, 20 patients with EADC, and 70 healthy examinees composing a control group). Their dietary habits were investigated by the usage of the dietary questionnaires. The results show that the fast eating and the insufficient mastication were present in 64.3-85.0% patients with GERD, BE, and EADC in comparison with only 15% of the examinees from the control group. Furthermore, very hot was preferred by 25.0-42.9% of the mentioned patients in comparison with only 12.9% from the control group. Similarly, 60.0-75.0% of them preferred strongly spiced food on contrary with 17.1% of the healthy examinees. Moreover, strong alcoholic beverages were consumed three or more times per week by 55.0-75.0% of the mentioned patients in comparison with only 15.7% from the control group. Finally, there were 15.7-55.0% heavy smokers among the patients with GERD, BE, and EADC contrary to 1.4% in the control group.",cancer
"Gorski Kotar--an endemic region for primary gastric non-hodgkin lymphoma? Primary gastric non Hodgkin lymphoma (PGNHL) is a distinct group of extranodal lymphomas with interesting geographical distribution and variable prevalence in different countries. We analysed epidemiological data of our patients with PGNHL in Primorsko-goranska County. Clinical data of 30 patients with PGNHL diagnosed and treated in Clinical Hospital Center of Rijeka, Croatia between January 1995 and December 2005 were prospectively analyzed. We used statistical analysis (t-test, chi2-test) for small groups. Out of 30 pts with PGNHL, 19 were born in Primorsko-goranska County, part of Croatia situated by the Adriatic sea which consists of three regions: City of Rijeka, Islands and Gorski Kotar. 6 of 19 patients (31.6%) were originally from Gorski Kotar which made incidence rate of PGNHL in Gorski Kotar 7 times higher than in other two regions. Many authors emphasized that relative frequency of PGNHL is very variable in various countries and regions. Geographical distribution of our patients was very surprising because Gorski Kotar is the region with lowest number of citizens, rural area without any known pollutants, and ecologically one of the most preserved microsystem in this part of Croatia. Gorski Kotar is known to be an endemic region for multiple sclerosis and lyme borreliosis. Is it for PGNHL too?",cancer
"Screening with mammography organized by family physicians teams: what have we learnt? The mammography, recommended as standard method for screening on breast cancer, can reveal suspicious lesions early enough to anable cancer elimination in entirely. Experience with women of the target population, 50-69 years old, included in the mass screening programs, show the reduction in the specific mortality by 30%. One of the main problem in organizing the preventive programs is how to increase responsiveness of subjects to screening. In the study, based on the large sample of over 1000 of subjects and 20 family medicine practices, included in the investigation, we showed that it is possible, by a pro-active involvement of family physicians teams and intensive educational and motivational activities, to achieve high level of over 80% of responsiveness to mammography screening. Analysis of the reasons of nonresponsiveness can contribute to better understanding of the mental processes included in a self-decision making. This, as the final aim, can help family physicians in their efforts to overcome many hidden barriers which obstruct their patients to accept the mammography screening.",cancer
"Skin cancers in Croatia, 2003-2005: epidemiological study. This study presents the incidence of major nonmelanoma skin cancers (major NMSCs), other nonmelanoma skin cancers (other NMSCs) and malignant melanoma (MM) in Croatia. The skin cancers recorded between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Until 2003, the incidence of major NMSCs and other NMSCs was not estimated in Croatia. Incident cases of NMSCs were identified by the use of a questionnaire distributed to dermatology departments in Croatia and then collected at the University Department of Dermatology and Venereology, Zagreb University Hospital Center, and from the records kept at the National Cancer Registry. Incident cases of MM were extracted from the National Cancer Registry. During the 3-year period, 9,479 cases of major NMSCs are recorded, 4,622 (49%) in male and 4,857 (51%) in female patients. The crude incidence rate was 72.1/100,000 for males and 70.3/100,000 for females. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) was the most common major NMSC in both sexes. In the total number of major NMSCs, there were 7,244 cases of BCC. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was the second most common major NMSC. There were 1,860 SCC cases. The crude incidence rate was 54.9/100,000 for BCC in males, 53.9/100,000 in females, and 14.6/100,000 for SCC in male and 13.4/100,000 in female patients. Other NMSCs were registered in 119 cases (53% male and 47% female). The crude incidence rate was 0.9/100,000 for male and 0.8/100,000 for female patients. MM was registered in 1,427 cases (48% male and 52% female.) The crude incidence rate was 10.7/100,000 for males and females. These results will serve as reference for studying the patterns of descriptive epidemiology of major NMSCs, other NMSCs and MM in Croatia and Europe in the forthcoming years.",cancer
"Effect of reimbursement changes on erythropoiesis-stimulating agent utilization and transfusions. Cancer patients frequently develop chemotherapy-induced anemia, which can be treated with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. These agents have shifted the standard of chemotherapy-induced anemia treatment away from the previous mainstay of red blood cell transfusions. In July 2007, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued a National Coverage Decision restricting reimbursement for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to those chemotherapy patients who have hemoglobin levels <10 g/dL at initiation of therapy. This decision was hypothesized to place a greater reliance on transfusions for chemotherapy-induced anemia treatment. This observational study examined transfusions and erythropoiesis-stimulating agent utilization rates within defined episodes of chemotherapy care using electronic medical records from seven practices consisting of 39 sites of care across seven states. We compared the frequency of myelosuppressive chemotherapy treatment, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent administrations, and red blood cell transfusions before and after the National Coverage Decision in oncology patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia. Although exposure to myelosuppressive chemotherapy was not different, erythropoiesis-stimulating agent administrations significantly decreased and blood transfusions significantly increased after implementation of the National Coverage Decision. The 31% increase in transfusions for patients aged 65 years and older was significant (P = 0.007) and higher than the 8% increase for patients younger than 65 years (P = 0.358). Changes in practice patterns for chemotherapy-induced anemia treatment that followed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reimbursement decision for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents seem to be impacting practice patterns. Further research is necessary to determine whether these changes represent a widespread and durable shift in patient treatment.",cancer
"The dystonia gene DYT1 is repressed by the transcription factor THAP1 (DYT6). Mutations in THAP1 have been associated with dystonia 6. THAP1 encodes a transcription factor with mostly unknown targets. We tested the hypothesis that THAP1 regulates the expression of DYT1 (TOR1A), another dystonia-causing gene. After characterization of the TOR1A promoter, we demonstrate that THAP1 binds to the core promoter of TOR1A. Further, we report that wild type THAP1 represses the expression of TOR1A, whereas dystonia 6-associated mutant THAP1 results in decreased repression of TOR1A. Our data demonstrate that THAP1 regulates the transcription of TOR1A, suggesting transcriptional dysregulation as a cause of dystonia.",cancer
"Safety of sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer patients who receive a second radioisotope injection after visualization failure in lymphoscintigraphy. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A failure to visualize axillary sentinel nodes in lymphoscintigraphy may lead to an unsuccessful sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and subsequent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). To avoid unnecessary ALND, a second radioisotope injection may be given but has been considered hazardous. We investigated the axillary recurrence rate after tumor-negative SNB in breast cancer patients who received a second tracer injection after axillary visualization failure in lymphoscintigraphy. METHODS: Altogether 1,309 breast cancer patients who underwent a tumor-negative SNB without an ALND were included. Two hundred seven (15.8%) patients received a second tracer injection due to visualization failure in lymphoscintigraphy and 1,102 (84.2%) did not. All patients received a blue dye injection prior to the SNB. The median follow-up time was 43 months. RESULTS: No isolated cancer recurrences were diagnosed in the ipsilateral axilla among patients who received two radioisotope injections. Disease-free survival and overall survival were similar among patients with one or two radioisotope injections (P = 0.122 and P = 0.200, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Additional radiocolloid tracer injection after axillary non-visualization in lymphoscintigraphy is safe and does not increase axillary recurrence risk after tumor-negative SNB. The results suggest that such patients can be safely managed with SNB without a need to perform an ALND.",cancer
"Cytoplasmic overexpression with membrane accentuation of stratifin in intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma after hepatectomy: correlation with clinicopathologic features and patient survival. PURPOSE: Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal malignancy that afflicts thousands of patients worldwide. Stratifin has been shown to participate in mediating G2 arrest in several cancers, and cells that express stratifin could contribute to the chemo- and radioresistance of cancers and poor prognosis. However, the clinical impact of stratifin on clinicopathological features of mass forming (MF)-CCA is still unclear. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with MF-CCA who had undergone hepatectomy were selected for an immunohistochemical study of stratifin. Sixteen clinicopathological variables were used for the survival analyses. RESULTS: Seventy-eight MF-CCA patients (36 men and 42 women) were studied. Cytoplasmic immunostaining with membrane prominence was found in 52.6% (41/78) of patients with MF-CCA after hepatectomy; this was significantly associated with elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels. During the median follow-up duration of 13.6 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 14.9%. Univariate analysis showed that an absence of clinical symptoms, better nutritional status, lower alkaline phosphatase, smaller tumor, negative lymph node metastasis, negative stratifin staining, and curative hepatic resection were associated with favorable OS rate for MF-CCA patients after hepatectomy. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis showed that the absence of clinical symptoms, negative lymph node metastasis, and curative hepatectomy independently predicted MF-CCA patients with favorable OS rate after hepatectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of stratifin was significantly associated with elevated CEA levels in patients with MF-CCA. The favorable OS for MF-CCA patients depends on the absence of clinical symptoms, negative lymph node metastasis, and curative hepatectomy.",cancer
"Surgical management in metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients after imatinib mesylate treatment. PURPOSE: Imatinib mesylate (IM) demonstrates substantial efficacy in most patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). However, progression of GIST eventually develops and emerges as a challenge. To assess the role of surgery in the multidisciplinary management of GISTs, we studied the surgical outcomes in GIST patients receiving IM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2001 and May 2009, 161 metastatic GIST patients received IM. Among them, 35 patients undergoing 38 surgeries were investigated. Patients were categorized based on extent of disease before surgery (responsive or stable disease (PR, SD), local progression (LP), and generalized progression (GP)). Each tumor was investigated for genetic alteration before and after surgery. RESULTS: Disease status before surgery was significantly associated with surgical result. Gross tumor clearance was achieved in 42.9% of patients with responsive disease, but only 4.8% of those with focal resistance and 0% of those with disease progression (P = 0.022). GIST patients with PR, SD, and LP had significant better 2-year progression-free survival and overall survival than those with GP. Secondary mutations tended to be found more frequently in GIST patients with LP after surgery than those with response (10/21 (47.6%) vs. 2/14 (14.3%); P = 0.07), indicating that surgery may prevent potential development of secondary mutation in GIST patients with response. Secondary kit mutations were also found more frequently with primary exon 11 mutation than those with exon 9 mutation (38.7% vs. 16.7%; P = 0.394). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery may benefit selected GIST patients with PR, SD, and LP, especially for patients with LP because patients with LP had comparable survival to that of patients with responsive lesion. Surgery may prevent potential development of secondary mutations in selected patients with response after IM treatment. Secondary kit mutation was found more frequently in GIST patients with a primary kit exon 11 mutation than those with a primary kit exon 9 mutation.",cancer
"Accuracy and clinical relevance of computed tomography scan interpretation of peritoneal cancer index in colorectal cancer peritoneal carcinomatosis: a multi-institutional study. BACKGROUND: Evaluation of peritoneal metastases by computed tomography (CT) scans is challenging and has been reported to be inaccurate. METHODS: A multi-institutional prospective observational registry study of patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from colorectal cancer was conducted and a subset analysis was performed to examine peritoneal cancer index (PCI) based on CT and intraoperative exploration. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (mean age 52.6 +/- 12.4 years) from 16 institutions were included in this study. Inaccuracies of CT-based assessment of lesion sizes were observed in the RUQ (P = 0.004), LLQ (P < 0.0005), RLQ (P = 0.003), distal jejunum (P = 0.004), and distal ileum (P < 0.0005). When CT-PCI was classified based on the extent of carcinomatosis, 17 cases (33%) were underestimations, of which, 11 cases (21%) were upstaged from low to moderate, 4 cases (8%) were upstaged from low to severe, and 2 cases (4%) were upstaged from moderate to severe. Relevant clinical discordance where an upstage occurred to severe carcinomatosis constituted a true inaccuracy and was observed in six cases (12%). CONCLUSIONS: The actual clinical impact of inaccuracies of CT-PCI was modest. CT-PCI will remain as a mandatory imaging tool and may be supplemented with other tools including positron emission tomography scan or diagnostic laparoscopy, in the patient selection for cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.",cancer

In this review, the currently available data on this topic are critically evaluated, while ongoing studies and future perspective are discussed.",cancer
"Obstructions of portal veins and tumor numbers are associated with humped hepatocellular carcinoma. Tumor protrusion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the risk signs of tumor rupture. Despite curative tumor treatments, HCC recurrences sometimes occur with rapidly growing humped or ruptured HCC in small sized tumors. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of humped HCC clinically and radiologically associated with tumor progression, liver damage, and treatment. The subjects were 179 consecutive HCC patients who underwent angiographic examination. Dynamic studies, using helical computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were assessed, and the HCC area were measured. The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage differed significantly between the humped and non-humped HCC groups. Humped HCC was more frequently observed in the right lobe (29.3% of right-lobe HCCs) than in the left (10.1%; p=0.003). Analysis of recurrent HCC revealed that patients with multiple treatments of >4 sessions had more humped HCC (33.8%) than those with 1-3 sessions (16.7%; p=0.042). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that tumor invasion in the portal vein, rather than large tumor size, was significantly associated with tumor protrusion. HCC recurrence with humped HCC occurs often in patients with multiple treatments. Tumor factors of the TNM classification, especially tumor invasion in the portal vein, might be associated with the mechanisms of tumor protrusion.",cancer
"Cancer of unknown primary site: a review of 28 cases and the efficacy of cisplatin/docetaxel therapy at a single institute in Japan. We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin/docetaxel (CDDP/TXT) chemotherapy and identified prognostic factors in Japanese patients with cancer of unknown primary site (CUP). Twenty-eight consecutive patients seen at a single institute were reviewed retrospectively. Sixteen patients were treated with TXT 80 mg/m2, followed by CDDP 75 mg/m2. The overall response rate to CDDP/TXT treatment was 62.5%, with a median survival time (MST) of 22.7 months. Common adverse reactions were myelosuppression and hyponatremia. The MST of all 28 patients with CUP was 8.3 months, and the 1-year overall survival rate was 45.6%. Univariate analysis identified 5 prognostic factors:performance status, liver involvement, bone involvement, pleural involvement, and lymph node involvement. In conclusion, CDDP/TXT chemotherapy is effective with tolerable toxicity in patients with CUP. Japanese patients with CUP might be chemosensitive and may survive longer.",cancer
"Epigenetic choreographers of neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain. Epigenetic mechanisms regulate cell differentiation during embryonic development and also serve as important interfaces between genes and the environment in adulthood. Neurogenesis in adults, which generates functional neural cell types from adult neural stem cells, is dynamically regulated by both intrinsic state-specific cell differentiation cues and extrinsic neural niche signals. Epigenetic regulation by DNA and histone modifiers, non-coding RNAs and other self-sustained mechanisms can lead to relatively long-lasting biological effects and maintain functional neurogenesis throughout life in discrete regions of the mammalian brain. Here, we review recent evidence that epigenetic mechanisms carry out diverse roles in regulating specific aspects of adult neurogenesis and highlight the implications of such epigenetic regulation for neural plasticity and disorders.",cancer
"Well-differentiated osteosarcoma of the jaw bones: a clinicopathologic study of 15 cases. Well-differentiated osteosarcoma of the jaw bones is rare, and is often confused with a variety of benign fibroosseous lesions. To better understand its clinicopathologic features, we reviewed our experience with 15 cases. The patients included 7 males and 8 females (age range 14 to 66 y; mean 42.8 y). Six of the tumors arose in the mandible, and 9 in the maxilla. Microscopically, the tumors were infiltrative, relatively hypocellular, and consisted of monomorphic, minimally atypical spindle cells that were usually arranged in fascicles. The tumor cells were intimately related to the surfaces of elongated trabeculae of neoplastic woven bone that lacked osteoblastic rimming. Nine patients were treated with wide excision, 2 patients with marginal excision, and 2 patients with excision and radiation therapy. After definitive therapy, there were no reports of recurrence or metastasis over an average follow-up of 34 months (range 1 to 80 mo). Well-differentiated gnathic osteosarcoma is a low-grade malignancy that may be successfully treated with wide local excision. The prognosis in our series was excellent.",cancer
"Invasive ductal carcinomas of the breast showing partial reversed cell polarity are associated with lymphatic tumor spread and may represent part of a spectrum of invasive micropapillary carcinoma. Invasive micropapillary carcinomas (IMPC) of the breast are aggressive tumors frequently associated with lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis even when micropapillary (MP) differentiation is very focal within the tumors. We have noticed that some breast carcinomas showing lymphatic spread but lacking histologic features of IMPC have occasional tumor cell clusters reminiscent of those of IMPC without the characteristic prominent retraction artifact. To study the clinicopathologic significance of such features, we prospectively selected 1323 invasive ductal carcinomas and determined the presence and extent of MP differentiation and retraction artifact in the tumors. One representative tumor block per case was used for immunostaining for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Partial reverse cell polarity (PRCP) was defined as prominent linear EMA reactivity on at least part of the periphery of tumor cell clusters usually associated with decreased cytoplasmic staining. The clinicopathologic features of carcinomas with PRCP were compared with IMPC and invasive ductal (no special type) carcinomas without this feature. Of the 1323 cases, 96 (7.3%) and 92 (7.0%) showed MP features and the presence of PRCP, respectively. We found that the presence of both PRCP and MP features were strongly associated with decreased cytoplasmic EMA immunoreactivity and the presence of lymphatic invasion and nodal metastasis, even if such features were present only very focally. Our results suggest that breast carcinomas with PRCP may have the same implication as MP differentiation and these tumors may represent part of a spectrum of IMPC. Complete or partial reversal of cell polarity may play a significant role in lymphatic tumor spread.",cancer
"Steatohepatitic hepatocellular carcinoma (SH-HCC): a distinctive histological variant of HCC in hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis with associated NAFLD/NASH. In explant livers with chronic hepatitis C (HCV-C) we have noted a distinctive histologic variant that we have termed steatohepatitic hepatocellular carcinoma (SH-HCC) with features resembling non-neoplastic steatohepatitis, including large droplet steatosis, ballooning of malignant hepatocytes, Mallory-Denk bodies, inflammation, and pericellular fibrosis. This study was undertaken to further describe the characteristics and prevalence of this histologic variant in HCV-C and any possible association with underlying risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We selected two 2-year periods (mid-2003 to mid-2005 and 2007 to 2008), from which selected explant livers with HCV-C and HCC were examined to determine the characteristics and frequency of SH-HCC. The underlying cirrhotic liver was also reassessed for steatosis and evidence of steatohepatitis. Clinical records were consulted for concomitant NAFLD and NASH risk factors. The SH-HCC variant was found in a total of 22 of 62 HCC cases (35.5%). Fourteen of the 22 patients with SH-HCC (63.6%) had at least one known risk factor for NAFLD/NASH including diabetes (6 of 22, 27.3%), obesity (6 of 22, 27.3%), hypertension (11 of 22, 50%), and hyperlipidemia (5 of 22, 27.8%). In 14 of the 22 cases (63.6%) of SH-HCC, the non-neoplastic liver showed changes of NAFLD/NASH superimposed on otherwise typical features of HCV-C. In conclusion, in our series of HCV-C explants, approximately one-third of HCCs show a distinctive histological variant termed SH-HCC. Underlying risk factors for NAFLD and for NASH were identified in 63.6% of our cases. Moreover, non-neoplastic tissue in HCV-C explants showed changes of NAFLD/NASH in 63.6% of cases. These results suggest a possible NAFLD/NASH pathway leading to SH-HCC in the setting of HCV-C which requires further investigation in the future.",cancer
"The purpose of this study is to explore the smoking-related behaviors of people >=60 years of age with respiratory diseases in Shangqiu area. A total of 550 patients with respiratory diseases >=60 years old who were treated at the First People's Hospital of Shangqiu from April 2015 to April 2017 were selected as the survey subjects through random sampling. Among them, there were 351 males and 199 females; the age ranged from 60 to 86 (72.85+-5.71) years old. Follow-up until April 2020, and the follow-up was 3 years or more and related information and death information were also collected. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to analyze the influence of smoking behavior in the survey subjects on the death risk of people with respiratory diseases >= 60 years old. A total of 550 cases were included in the survey, and 25 cases were lost to follow-up. The effective number was 525, and the survey effective rate was 95.45%. Among the 525 patients, 336 (64.00%) were males and 189 (36.00%) were females. The age ranged from 60 to 86 (72.69+-5.64) years old. The education level was mainly high school and technical secondary school, accounting for 39.24% of the total population. The primary diseases included tracheitis/bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia, COPD and lung cancer. Among 525 patients with respiratory diseases >=60 years old, non-smokers accounted for 11.05% (58/525), smokers accounted for 68.00% (357/525), and quitters accounted for 20.95% (110/525). The duration of smoking was more than 20 years, accounting for 33.33% (175/525). The smoking intensity was mainly moderate, accounting for 33.90% (178/525). The duration of smoking cessation was mainly<5 years, accounting for 8.76% (46/525). Follow-up until April 2020, the mortality rate of 525 patients with respiratory diseases >=60 years old was 14.10% (74/525). Cox regression analysis showed that smoking duration, smoking intensity, cumulative smoking amount, and duration of smoking cessation were the influencing factors of death in patients with respiratory diseases >=60 years old in Shangqiu area (P<0.05). It can be seen that smoking duration, smoking intensity, cumulative smoking amount, and smoking cessation duration may be independent risk factors for death in patients with respiratory diseases >= 60 years old in Shangqiu area, and may increase the relative risk of death.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Epitope prediction is a useful approach in cancer immunology and immunotherapy. Many computational methods, including machine learning and network analysis, have been developed quickly for such purposes. However, regarding clinical applications, the existing tools are insufficient because few of the predicted binding molecules are immunogenic. Hence, to develop more potent and effective vaccines, it is important to understand binding and immunogenic potential. Here, we observed that the interactive association constituted by human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-peptide pairs can be regarded as a network in which each HLA and peptide is taken as a node. We speculated whether this network could detect the essential interactive propensities embedded in HLA-peptide pairs. Thus, we developed a network-based deep learning method called DeepNetBim by harnessing binding and immunogenic information to predict HLA-peptide interactions. RESULTS: Quantitative class I HLA-peptide binding data and qualitative immunogenic data (including data generated from T cell activation assays, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding assays and MHC ligand elution assays) were retrieved from the Immune Epitope Database database. The weighted HLA-peptide binding network and immunogenic network were integrated into a network-based deep learning algorithm constituted by a convolutional neural network and an attention mechanism. The results showed that the integration of network centrality metrics increased the power of both binding and immunogenicity predictions, while the new model significantly outperformed those that did not include network features and those with shuffled networks. Applied on benchmark and independent datasets, DeepNetBim achieved an AUC score of 93.74% in HLA-peptide binding prediction, outperforming 11 state-of-the-art relevant models. Furthermore, the performance enhancement of the combined model, which filtered out negative immunogenic predictions, was confirmed on neoantigen identification by an increase in both positive predictive value (PPV) and the proportion of neoantigen recognition. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a network-based deep learning method called DeepNetBim as a pan-specific epitope prediction tool. It extracted the attributes of the network as new features from HLA-peptide binding and immunogenic models. We observed that not only did DeepNetBim binding model outperform other updated methods but the combination of our two models showed better performance. This indicates further applications in clinical practice.",nocancer
"Within the intestinal epithelium, regulation of intracellular protein and vesicular trafficking is of utmost importance for barrier maintenance, immune responses, and tissue polarity. RAB11A is a small GTPase that mediates the anterograde transport of protein cargos to the plasma membrane. Loss of RAB11A-dependent trafficking in mature intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) results in increased epithelial proliferation and nuclear accumulation of Yes-Associated Protein (YAP), a key Hippo-signaling transducer that senses cell-cell contacts and regulates tissue growth. However, it is unclear how RAB11A regulates YAP intracellular localizations. In this report, we examined the relationship of RAB11A to epithelial junctional complexes, YAP, and the associated consequences on colonic epithelial tissue repair. We found that RAB11A controls the biochemical associations of YAP with multiple components of adherens and tight junctions, including alpha-catenin, beta-catenin, and Merlin, a tumor suppressor. In the absence of RAB11A and Merlin, we observed enhanced YAP-beta-catenin complex formation and nuclear translocation. Upon chemical injury to the intestine, mice deficient in RAB11A were found to have reduced epithelial integrity, decreased YAP localization to adherens and tight junctions, and increased nuclear YAP accumulation in the colon epithelium. Thus, RAB11A-regulated trafficking regulates the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway for rapid reparative response after tissue injury.",nocancer
"Studies demonstrate a role for neurotensin (NT) in obesity and related comorbidities. Bile acid (BA) homeostasis alterations are associated with obesity. We determined the effect of NT on BA metabolism in obese and non-obese conditions. Plasma and fecal BA profiles were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in male and female NT+/+ and NT-/- mice fed low-fat (LFD) or high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks (early stage of obesity) or greater than 20 weeks (late stage of obesity). The nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and BA transporter mRNA expression were assessed in ileum, mouse enteroids, and human cell lines. HFD decreased plasma primary and secondary BAs in NT+/+ mice; HFD-induced decrease of plasma BAs was improved in NT-deficient mice. In NT+/+ mice, HFD inhibited ileal FXR and BA transporter expression; HFD-decreased expression of FXR and BA transporters was prevented in NT-/- mice. Compared with LFD-fed NT+/+ mice, LFD-fed NT-/- mice had relatively lower levels of ileal FXR and BA transporter expression. Moreover, NT stimulates the expression of FXR and BA transporters in Caco-2 cells; however, stimulated expression of BA transporters was attenuated in NT-/- enteroids. Therefore, we demonstrate that HFD disrupts the BA metabolism and ileal FXR and BA transporter axis which are improved in the absence of NT, suggesting that NT contributes to HFD-induced disruption of BA metabolism and plays an inhibitory role in the regulation of ileal FXR and BA transporter signaling under obese conditions. Conversely, NT positively regulates the expression of ileal FXR and BA transporters under non-obese conditions. Therefore, NT plays a dual role in obese and non-obese conditions, suggesting possible therapeutic strategies for obesity control.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to translate the Shoulder Rating Questionnaire (SRQ-T) into Turkish and to determine the validity and reliability of the translated version in patients shoulder pain. METHODS: The Turkish version of the SRQ-T was applied to patients after translation from English into Turkish. Patients with various shoulder pain complaint were included into the study if they were over 18 years. The patients with mixed-type pain, cancer pain, headache, substance abuse, severe depression, and fibromyalgia syndrome were excluded. The musculoskeletal and neurological examinations of the patients were performed. The Turkish version of the SRQ-T and Disabilities of arm, shoulder, hands-T (DASH-T) were applied to all patients. RESULTS: 122 patients were included in the study, and then patients are divided into two groups: Group 1, working group (n = 72); Group 2, non- working group (n = 50). The reliability and consistency of SRQ-T for all the samples were acceptable with a Cronbach's coefficient of 0.979. The test-retest method was used to determine reliability of the scale. Cronbach's alpha was measured pre-assessment and post- assessment; the values were 0.815 and 0.770, respectively. The correlation analysis was determined for all the samples and calculated as 0.780. Also, the test-retest method with Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used to determine reliability of the SRQ- T and its domains in group 1 and group 2. CONCLUSION: The Turkish version of the SRQ-T seems to be a valid and reliable self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the shoulder pain in Turkish patients.

"Pyrazolothiazole-substituted pyridine conjugates are an important class of heterocyclic compounds with an extensive variety of potential applications in the medicinal and pharmacological arenas. Therefore, herein, we describe an efficient and facile approach for the synthesis of novel pyrazolo-thiazolo-pyridine conjugate 4, via multicomponent condensation. The latter compound was utilized as a base for the synthesis of two series of 15 novel pyrazolothiazole-based pyridine conjugates (5-16). The newly synthesized compounds were fully characterized using several spectroscopic methods (IR, NMR and MS) and elemental analyses. The anti-proliferative impact of the new synthesized compounds 5-13 and 16 was in vitro appraised towards three human cancer cell lines: human cervix (HeLa), human lung (NCI-H460) and human prostate (PC-3). Our outcomes regarding the anti-proliferative activities disclosed that all the tested compounds exhibited cytotoxic potential towards all the tested cell lines with IC50 = 17.50-61.05 microM, especially the naphthyridine derivative 7, which exhibited the most cytotoxic potential towards the tested cell lines (IC50 = 14.62-17.50 microM) compared with the etoposide (IC50 = 13.34-17.15 microM). Moreover, an in silico docking simulation study was performed on the newly prepared compounds within topoisomerase II (3QX3), to suggest the binding mode of these compounds as anticancer candidates. The in silico docking results indicate that compound 7 was a promising lead anticancer compound which possesses high binding affinity toward topoisomerase II (3QX3) protein.",nocancer
"Protein-energy wasting (PEW) is associated with adverse outcomes in hemodialysis patients. This study compares the simplified creatinine index (SCI) and circulating inflammatory markers as nutritional screening tools for hemodialysis patients. Maintenance hemodialysis patients (230 total patients, 34.8% women, 64.0 +- 14.3 years old) from a tertiary medical center were assessed for demographic data, body composition analysis, biochemistry tests, and circulating inflammatory biomarkers. The SCI was calculated using Canaud's formula. Reduced fat-free mass index (FFMI), a surrogate of lean body mass, was identified according to the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism guidelines. Nutritional status was assessed by the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) and International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM) criteria. Multivariate logistic regression revealed independent risk factors for low FFMI and malnutrition. Of the patients, 47.4% had low FFMI. Patients with a reduction in FFMI tended to be older females with lower body mass index, SCI, and GNRI scores but significantly higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-8. SCI was found to be an independent predictor for reduced FFMI (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.40-0.81) and presence of PEW according to ISRNM criteria (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.21-0.68). Although a positive association between systemic inflammatory markers and low FFMI was observed, this association disappeared in multivariate analysis. Moreover, the inflammatory markers examined in this study were not associated with malnutrition after adjusting for potential confounders. Compared with markers of systemic inflammation, SCI achieved better performance in assessing the nutritional status of hemodialysis patients.",nocancer
"The untreated systemic chronic inflammation leads to autoimmune diseases, hyperglycemia, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and so on. Phytochemicals effectively inhibit the inflammation, and numerous studies have proved that the phytocomponents possess anti-inflammatory property via inhibiting the cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase signaling pathways. Rhaponticin is one such phytochemical obtained from the perennial plant Rheum rhaponticum L. belonging to Polygonaceae family. We assessed the anti-inflammatory potency of rhaponticin in endothelial cells induced with lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Four different endothelial cells induced with LPS were treated with rhaponticin and assessed for the nitric oxide generation. The cytotoxic potency of rhaponticin was evaluated in endothelial cells using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthizaol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay. The tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) synthesis was quantified using the commercially available assay kit. The inflammatory signaling protein gene expression of TNF-alpha, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) was analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The gene expression of NADPH oxidase (NOX) cytoplasmic catalytic subunits gp91phox , p47phox , and p22phox was assessed with real-time PCR analysis. Finally, to confirm the anti-inflammatory potency of rhaponticin, the nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling protein expression was analyzed with immunoblotting analysis. Rhaponticin treatment significantly decreased the levels of nitric oxide and TNF-alpha synthesis in LPS-induced endothelial cells. It significantly decreased the gene expression of inflammatory proteins and NOX signaling protein. The protein expression of NFkappaB and MAPK signaling proteins was drastically decreased in rhaponticin-treated endothelial cells induced with LPS. Overall, our results confirm that rhaponticin effectively inhibited the inflammation triggered by LPS in endothelial cells via downregulating iNOS, COX2, and NFkappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.",nocancer
"In this study, we investigated the effects of treatment with Gingko biloba leaf extract (GLE) on intestinal transporter expression and gut microbiota composition in mice and the correlation between intestinal transporter expression and gut microbiota composition in mice. When GLE was orally administered to mice, intestinal BCRP expression was significantly suppressed. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve values of sulfasalazine were increased more than twice by treatment with GLE compared with those in the control group. GLE treatment significantly decreased the populations of Proteobacteria and Deferribacteres at the phylum level. Correlation analysis showed that BCRP expression was positively or negatively correlated with the composition of gut bacteria. In Caco-2 cells, GLE treatment did not affect BCRP expression, but treatment with the lysates of GLE-treated mouse feces significantly suppressed BCRP expression. These findings demonstrate that the suppression of intestinal BCRP expression following GLE treatment may occur through modulation of the gut microbiota composition. Thus, the present study suggests that modulation of gut microbiota composition may cause drug transporter-mediated herb-drug interactions.",nocancer
"Introduction: The novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread throughout the globe, causing a pandemic. In Egypt over 96,108 individuals were infected so far. Objective: In the present study, the objective is to perform a complete genome sequence of SAR-CoV2 isolated from Egyptian coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. Methods: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 61 COVID-19 patients who attended at National Cancer Institute, Kasr Al-Aini Hospital and the army hospital. Viral RNA was extracted and whole genomic sequencing was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing. Results: In all cases, the sequenced virus has at least 99% identity to the reference Wuhan 1. The sequence analysis showed 204 distinct genome variations including 114 missense mutations, 72 synonymous mutations, 1 disruptive in-frame deletion, 7 downstream gene mutations, 6 upstream gene mutations, 3 frame-shift deletions, and 1 in-frame deletion. The most dominant clades were G/GH/GR/O and the dominant type is B. Conclusion: The whole genomic sequence of SARS-CoV2 showed 204 variations in the genomes of the Egyptian isolates, where the Asp614Gly (D614G) substitution is the most common among the samples (60/61). So far, there were no strikingly variations specific to the Egyptian population, at least for this set of samples.",nocancer
"Few articles are reported for the simultaneous separation and sensitive detection of the kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolites. This work describes a capillary electrochromatography-mass spectrometry (CEC-MS) method using acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS) functionalized stationary phase. The AMPS column was prepared by first performing silanization of bare silica with gamma-maps, followed by polymerization with AMPS. The CEC-MS/MS methods were established for six upstream and three downstream KP metabolites. The simultaneous separation of all nine KP metabolites is achieved without derivatization for the first time in the open literature. Numerous parameters such as pH and the concentration of background electrolyte, the concentration of the polymerizable AMPS monomer, column length, field strength, and internal pressure were all tested to optimize the separation of multiple KP metabolites. A baseline separation of six upstream metabolites, namely tryptophan (TRP), kynurenine (KYN), 3-hydroxykynurenine (HKYN), kynurenic acid (KA), anthranilic acid (AA), and xanthurenic acid (XA), was possible at pH 9.25 within 26 min. Separation of six downstream and related metabolites, namely: tryptamine (TRPM), hydroxy-tryptophan (HTRP), hydroxyindole-3 acetic acid (HIAA), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), picolinic acid (PA), and quinolinic acid (QA), was achieved at pH 9.75 in 30 min. However, the challenging simultaneous separation of all nine KP metabolites was only accomplished by increasing the column length and simultaneous application of internal pressure and voltage in 114 min. Quantitation of KP metabolites in commercial human plasma was carried out, and endogenous concentration of five KP metabolites was validated. The experimental limit of quantitation ranges from 100 to 10,000 nM (S/N = 8-832, respectively), whereas the experimental limit of detection ranges from 31 to 1000 nM (S/N = 2-16, respectively). Levels of five major KP metabolites, namely TRP, KYN, KA, AA, and QA, and their ratios in patient plasma samples previously screened for inflammatory biomarkers [C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)] was measured. Pairs of the level of metabolites with significant positive correlation were statistically evaluated.",nocancer
"The aged adaptive immune system is characterized by progressive dysfunction as well as increased autoimmunity. This decline is responsible for elevated susceptibility to infection and cancer, as well as decreased vaccination efficacy. Recent evidence indicates that CD4+ T cell-intrinsic alteratins contribute to chronic inflammation and are sufficient to accelerate an organism-wide aging phenotype, supporting the idea that T cell aging plays a major role in body-wide deterioration. In this Review, we propose ten molecular hallmarks to represent common denominators of T cell aging. These hallmarks are grouped into four primary hallmarks (thymic involution, mitochondrial dysfunction, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and loss of proteostasis) and four secondary hallmarks (reduction of the TCR repertoire, naive-memory imbalance, T cell senescence, and lack of effector plasticity), and together they explain the manifestation of the two integrative hallmarks (immunodeficiency and inflammaging). A major challenge now is weighing the relative impact of these hallmarks on T cell aging and understanding their interconnections, with the final goal of defining molecular targets for interventions in the aging process.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: In March-April 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic lockdown in Denmark, the Danish Health Authorities recommended that, where possible, face-to-face patient-physician consultations be replaced by telephone consultations. The aim of this study was to obtain patients' evaluation of their telemedicine experience. METHODS: Patients who were candidates for telemedicine consultations were recruited based on their urological ailment, necessity for follow-up and comorbidity. New referrals including patients with suspicion of cancer were not candidates for telemedicine. In total, 548 patients had their appointment altered during the period from 13 March to 30 April 2020. Postal questionnaires were sent to 548 patients and 300 (54.7%) replied. RESULTS: In total, 280 patient answered, 224 (80%) men and 56 (20%) women, mean age 69 years (range 18-91) of whom 180 (64.3%) had a benign and 100 (35.7%) a malignant diagnosis. Twenty (6.7%) respondents did not remember their telephone consultation and were therefore excluded. Telephone consultation satisfaction was reported by 230 (85.0%) patients, but they would not prefer video consultations over telephone consultations, and only 102 (36.4%) would prefer telephone consultations in the future. Patients' age, sex and distance to the hospital did not seem to be associated with telephone consultation satisfaction (age p = 0.17; sex p = 0.99; distance p = 0.27, respectively). In total, 226 (80.7%) were medically assessed as being at risk for COVID, but 74 (26.4%) subjectively evaluated themselves as being at risk. CONCLUSIONS: In general (85.0%), urological patients were satisfied with telephone consultations.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Most of the infected people have no clinical symptoms. The current strategy for HCV elimination includes test and treatment. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the campaign for retrieving patients who were lost to follow-up, for subsequent re-evaluation. METHODS: From January 2020 to October 2020, patients who had prior tests for positive anti-HCV antibody in 2010-2018 in our hospital were enrolled for our patient callback campaign. Patients who had unknown HCV RNA status or no documented successful antiviral therapy history were selected for anti-HCV therapy re-evaluation. To facilitate patient referral in the hospital, we developed an electronic reminding system and called the candidate patients via telephone during the study period. RESULTS: Through the hospital electronic system, 3783 patients with positive anti-HCV antibody documentation were identified. Among them, 1446 (38.22%) had tested negative for HCV RNA or had anti-HCV therapy, thereby excluded. Of the 2337 eligible patients, 1472 (62.99%) were successfully contacted and called back during the study period for subsequent HCV RNA testing and therapy. We found that 42.19% of the patients had positive HCV RNA and 88% received subsequent anti-HCV therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A significant number of patients with positive HCV serology were lost for HCV confirmatory test or therapy in the hospital. Therefore, this targeted HCV callback approach in the hospital is feasible and effective in achieving microelimination.",nocancer
"Introduction: Intracellular delivery of molecules is central to applications in biotechnology, medicine, and basic research. Nanoparticle-mediated photoporation using carbon black nanoparticles exposed to pulsed, near-infrared laser irradiation offers a physical route to create transient cell membrane pores, enabling intracellular delivery. However, nanoparticle-mediated photoporation, like other physical intracellular delivery technologies, necessitates a trade-off between achieving efficient uptake of exogenous molecules and maintaining high cell viability. Methods: In this study, we sought to shift this balance by adding serum to cells during nanoparticle-mediated photoporation as a viability protectant. DU-145 prostate cancer cells and human dermal fibroblasts were exposed to laser irradiation in the presence of carbon black (CB) nanoparticles and other formulation additives, including fetal bovine serum (FBS) and polymers. Results: Our studies showed that FBS can protect cells from viability loss, even at high-fluence laser irradiation conditions that lead to high levels of intracellular delivery in two different mammalian cell types. Further studies revealed that full FBS was not needed: viability protection was achieved with denatured FBS, with just the high molecular weight fraction of FBS (>30 kDa), or even with individual proteins like albumin or hemoglobin. Finally, we found that viability protection was also obtained using certain neutral water-soluble polymers, including Pluronic F127, polyvinylpyrrolidone, poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline), and polyethylene glycol, which were more effective at increased concentration, molecular weight, or hydrophobicity. Conclusion: Altogether, these findings suggest an interaction between amphiphilic domains of polymers with the cell membrane to help cells maintain viability, possibly by facilitating transmembrane pore closure. In this way, serum components or synthetic polymers can be used to increase intracellular delivery by nanoparticle-mediated photoporation while maintaining high cell viability.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Autophagy is intensively studied in cancer, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about its role in pathological conditions linked to altered neurotransmission. We examined the involvement of autophagy in levodopa (l-dopa)-induced dyskinesia, a frequent motor complication developed in response to standard dopamine replacement therapy in parkinsonian patients. METHODS: We used mouse and non-human primate models of Parkinson's disease to examine changes in autophagy associated with chronic l-dopa administration and to establish a causative link between impaired autophagy and dyskinesia. RESULTS: We found that l-dopa-induced dyskinesia is associated with accumulation of the autophagy-specific substrate p62, a marker of autophagy deficiency. Increased p62 was observed in a subset of projection neurons located in the striatum and depended on l-dopa-mediated activation of dopamine D1 receptors, and mammalian target of rapamycin. Inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 with rapamycin counteracted the impairment of autophagy produced by l-dopa, and reduced dyskinesia. The anti-dyskinetic effect of rapamycin was lost when autophagy was constitutively suppressed in D1 receptor-expressing striatal neurons, through inactivation of the autophagy-related gene protein 7. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that augmented responsiveness at D1 receptors leads to dysregulated autophagy, and results in the emergence of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia. They further suggest the enhancement of autophagy as a therapeutic strategy against dyskinesia.   2021 The Authors.

"Increasing parity is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke in women. This is likely attributed to biological responses of pregnancy. Male cells of presumed fetal origin are commonly present in women years after pregnancy-a phenomenon termed male origin microchimerism. Here, we investigated whether male origin microchimerism was associated with risk of IHD and ischemic stroke in women. We evaluated the association between male origin microchimerism and ischemic events in a cohort of 766 Danish women enrolled in the Diet, Cancer and Health cohort during 1993-1997 when aged 50-64 years. Of these, 545 (71.2%) tested positive for male origin microchimerism by targeting the Y-chromosome (DYS14) in women's blood. Multiple Cox regression models were used to report hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals. We found male origin microchimerism was associated with a significantly reduced rate of IHD (HR=0.44, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.83), but not ischemic stroke (HR=0.80, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.41). Our findings show that microchimerism-positivity is associated with a lower rate of later IHD development in women. Although the underlying mechanisms are presently unknown, male origin microchimerism may be relevant in women's cardiovascular health. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Today synbiotics are considered as immunomodulatory agents. The current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effect of synbiotics and probiotics on inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in autoimmune disease. MATERIALS & METHODS: The English literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Central Cochrane Library through March 2020. Random effects models and generic inverse variance methods were used to synthesize quantitative data by STATA14. RESULTS: From a total of 623 entries identified via searches, ten RCTs (n = 440; 216 as intervention, 224 as controls) were included. An additional eleven studies with same intervention and different markers were also explained systematically. The pooled effect size showed that Interleukin (IL)-6 (WMD = -7.79 pg/ml; 95% CI = -13.81, -1.77, P = 0.011), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF)-alpha (WMD = -1.05 pg/ml; 95% CI = -2.01, -0.10, P = 0.030), high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (hs-CRP) (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI = -0.79, -0.37, P < 0.001), Malondialdehyde (MDA) (SMD = -0.36; 95% CI = -0.68, -0.04; P = 0.026), Homeostasis Model of Assessment-estimated Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (WMD = -0.71; 95% CI = -1.05, -0.37, P < 0.001), and beta cell function (HOMA-beta) (WMD = -15.18; 95% CI = -22.08, -8.28, P < 0.001) changed following probiotics (or synbiotics) supplementation. Also supplementation with doses more than 2 billion CFU could reduce IL-10 concentrations (WMD = -1.84; 95% CI = -2.23, 1.87; P < 0.001). Glutathione (GSH) and Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) levels did not influence by synbiotics and probiotics; insignificancy was remained after subgrouping for participants' age, study duration, and disease duration. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed that synbiotics and probiotics supplementation has significant effect on some inflammatory and oxidative stress markers; although, the number of trials was too small to powerful conclusion and further investigations may be needed.",nocancer
"Certain underlying diseases such as diabetic mellitus and hypertension are a risk factor for the severity and mortality of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients. Furthermore, both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are controversial at role in the process of COVID-19 cases. The aim of the study was to investigate whether underlying diseases and taking ACEi/ARBs, affect the duration of hospitalization and mortality in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Medical usage claims data for the past three years until 15 May 2020, from the ""CORONA-19 International Cooperation Research"" project was used. We analyzed the medical insurance claims data for all 7590 coronavirus (COVID-19) patients confirmed by RT-PCR tests nationwide up to 15 May 2020. Among the comorbidities, a history of hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.056-2.158) and diabetes (HR, 1.867; 95% CI, 1.408-2.475) were associated significantly with mortality. Furthermore, heart failure (HR, 1.391; 95% CI, 1.027-1.884), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR, 1.615; 95% CI, 1.185-2.202), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.451; 95% CI, 1.018-2.069), mental disorder (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.106-2.343), end stage renal disease (HR, 5.353; 95% CI, 2.185-13.12) were also associated significantly with mortality. The underlying disease has increased the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19. Diabetes, hypertension, cancer, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and mental disorders increased mortality. Controversial whether taking ACEi/ARBs would benefit COVID-19 patients, in our study, patients taking ACEi/ARBs had a higher risk of mortality.",nocancer
"Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is a human pathogen that lives in the gastric mucosa of approximately 50% of the world's population causing gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. An increase in resistance to current drugs has sparked the search for new Hp drug targets and therapeutics. One target is the disruption of nucleic acid production, which can be achieved by impeding the synthesis of 6-oxopurine nucleoside monophosphates, the precursors of DNA and RNA. These metabolites are synthesized by Hp xanthine-guanine-hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XGHPRT). Here, nucleoside phosphonates have been evaluated, which inhibit the activity of this enzyme with Ki values as low as 200 nM. The prodrugs of these compounds arrest the growth of Hp at a concentration of 50 muM in cell-based assays. The kinetic properties of HpXGHPRT have been determined together with its X-ray crystal structure in the absence and presence of 9-[(N-3-phosphonopropyl)-aminomethyl-9-deazahypoxanthine, providing a basis for new antibiotic development.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association of psychiatric disorders with (1) caries experience, (2) periodontal status, and (3) metabolic syndrome (MetS) components. METHOD AND MATERIALS: This 7-year cross-sectional study retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 504 individuals aged 18 to 90 years who attended the student dental clinic. Collected data included: demographics, smoking habits, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse, waist circumference, full-mouth plaque score (FMPS), full-mouth bleeding score (FMBS), maximal pocket probing depth (PPD), average and maximal radiographic bone loss (RBL), the sum of the number of decayed (D), missing (M), and filled (F) teeth (DMFT score), and presence of MetS components, consequences and related conditions including diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, s/p stroke, and cancer. RESULTS: 68 (13.5%) had psychiatric disorders with an average age of 53.42 +- 15.71 years. Psychiatric disorders were positively associated with smoking (P = .008), smoking pack-years (P = .004), DMFT score (P = .005), and negatively associated with hypertension (P = .046). Psychiatric disorders had no statistically significant associations with all periodontal indices studied and with other components of MetS. Following multivariate analysis, psychiatric disorders retained a statistically significant positive association with smoking (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.24 [1.28 to 3.92]) and with DMFT (OR and 95% CI = 1.08 [1.02 to 1.14]), and a statistically significant negative association with hypertension (OR and 95% CI = 0.46 [0.25 to 0.84]). CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric disorders were positively associated with smoking and caries experience but not with periodontal status and metabolic morbidity. Communication between dental and medical professionals is needed to address the higher smoking consumption and caries morbidity in psychiatric patients.",nocancer
"Background/Aims: Meta-analyses of randomized trials reported a non-significant increase in overall mortality risk after Helicobacter pylori eradication. In this study, we investigated whether H. pylori treatment is associated with increased risk of overall mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: In this retrospective population-based cohort study, we identified 66,706 patients treated for type 2 diabetes between 2002 and 2010 from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort. Patients who received H. pylori treatment (Hp-treatment cohort, 1,727 patients) were matched to those who did not (non-treatment cohort, 3,454 patients) at a 1:2 ratio. The primary outcome was overall mortality. The secondary outcomes were mortalities due to cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, or cancers. To estimate hazard ratio (HR) with confidential interval (CI), we used the Cox proportional-hazard model. Results: During a median follow-up of 4.7 years, the overall mortality was 5.9% (101/1,727 patients) among patients in the Hp-treatment cohort and 7.6% (364/3,454 patients) among patients in the non-treatment cohort. Adjusted HR (aHR) for overall mortality in the Hp-treatment cohort was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.93; p = 0.011). The mortality risks due to cardiovascular disease (aHR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.54 to 3.30; p = 0.529), cerebrovascular disease (aHR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.37 to 2.55; p = 0.947), and cancer (aHR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.72; p = 0.742) were not significantly different between the groups. Conclusions: In type 2 diabetes patients, overall mortality did not increase after H. pylori treatment.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: The rs17782313 variant of the MC4R gene plays an important role in the obesity phenotype. Studies that evaluate environmental factors and genetic variants associated with obesity may represent a great advance in understanding the development of this disease. This work seeks to assess the association of the polymorphism of MC4R rs17782313 on plasma parameters, including leptin, ghrelin, tumor necrosis factor (TNFalpha) and interleukin 6 (IL6), and on the eating behaviors of morbidly obese women. METHODS: 70 adult women with BMI between 40 and 60 kg/m2 were recruited. Laboratory and anthropometric data were recorded. Using a visual analog scale (VAS), the feelings of hunger and satiety were evaluated. The presence or absence of binge eating was evaluated through the Binge Eating Scale (BES) questionnaire. Habitual food intake was analyzed using 3-day dietary records. TaqMan  assays were conducted using real-time PCR to assess genotype polymorphism variants from peripheral blood DNA. RESULTS: This study found that female patients with the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism had high levels of ghrelin and reduced levels of IL6 in the postprandial period. We observed a higher prevalence of severe binge eating in more than 50% of women with at least one risk allele. CONCLUSION: Our hypothesis is that the MC4R rs17782313 polymorphism may influence the release of ghrelin, even without being associated with feelings of hunger and satiety. More than half of women with this polymorphism exhibited severe binge eating. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III: case-control analytic study.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Previous reports have suggested that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway is involved in the development of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP)-related acute lung injury (ALI). Inhibition of p38 by SB203580 blocked the inflammatory responses in SAP-ALI. However, the precise mechanism associated with p38 is unclear, particularly in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell (PMVEC) injury. AIM: To determine its role in the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced inflammation and apoptosis of PMVECs in vitro. We then conducted in vivo experiments to confirm the effect of SB203580-mediated p38 inhibition on SAP-ALI. METHODS: In vitro, PMVEC were transfected with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 6 (Glu), which constitutively activates p38, and then stimulated with TNF-alpha. Flow cytometry and western blotting were performed to detect the cell apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine levels, respectively. In vivo, SAP-ALI was induced by 5% sodium taurocholate and three different doses of SB203580 (2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) were intraperitoneally injected prior to SAP induction. SAP-ALI was assessed by performing pulmonary histopathology assays, measuring myeloperoxidase activity, conducting arterial blood gas analyses and measuring TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-6 levels. Lung microvascular permeability was measured by determining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration, Evans blue extravasation and ultrastructural changes in PMVECs. The apoptotic death of pulmonary cells was confirmed by performing a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling analysis and examining the Bcl2, Bax, Bim and cle-caspase3 levels. The proteins levels of P-p38, NFkappaB, IkappaB, P-signal transducer and activator of transcription-3, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, HO-1 and Myd88 were detected in the lungs to further evaluate the potential mechanism underlying the protective effect of SB203580. RESULTS: In vitro, mitogen-activated protein kinase (Glu) transfection resulted in higher apoptotic rates and cytokine (IL-1beta and IL-6) levels in TNF-alpha-treated PMVECs. In vivo, SB2035080 attenuated lung histopathological injury, decreased inflammatory activity (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and myeloperoxidase) and preserved pulmonary function. Furthermore, SB203580 significantly reversed changes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration, Evans blue accumulation, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling-positive cell numbers, apoptosis-related proteins (cle-caspase3, Bim and Bax) and endothelial microstructure. Moreover, SB203580 significantly reduced the pulmonary P-p38, NFkappaB, P-signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 and Myd88 levels but increased the IkappaB and HO-1 levels. CONCLUSION: p38 inhibition may protect against SAP-ALI by alleviating inflammation and the apoptotic death of PMVECs.",nocancer
"Essential oils from the leaf and twig of Polyalthia suberosa (Roxb.) Thwaites were analyzed using GC-MS/FID. A total of sixty-three constituents were namely identified accounting for 96.03 and 94.12% in the hydro-distilled oils of the leaf and twig, respectively. Monoterpenes, monoterpenoids, sesquiterpenes, and sesquiterpenoids were characteristic derivatives of P. suberosa essential oils. Sesquiterpenes bicyclogermacrene (26.26%) and ( E )-caryophyllene (7.79%), and monoterpene beta-pinene (12.71%) were the major constituents of the leaf oil. Sesquiterpenes ( E )-caryophyllene (17.17%) and alpha-humulene (9.55%), sesquiterpenoid caryophyllene oxide (9.41%), and monoterpenes camphene (8.16%) and tricyclene (6.35%) were to be main components in the twig oil. The leaf oil indicated cytotoxic activity against three cancer cell lines HepG2, MCF7 and A549 with the IC 50 values of 60.96-69.93 m g/mL, while the twig oil inhibited MCF7 with the IC 50 value of 66.70 mg/mL. Additionally, the twig oil successfully controlled the negative Gram bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa , fungus Aspergillus niger , and yeast Candida albicans with the same MIC value of 50 mg/mL, whereas the leaf oil have the same result with the negative Gram bacterium Escherichia coli .",nocancer
"Treg cells are critical regulators of immune homeostasis, and environment-driven Treg cell differentiation into effector (e)Treg cells is crucial for optimal functioning. However, human Treg cell programming in inflammation is unclear. Here, we combine transcriptional and epigenetic profiling to identify a human eTreg cell signature. Inflammation-derived functional Treg cells have a transcriptional profile characterized by upregulation of both a core Treg cell (FOXP3, CTLA4, TIGIT) and effector program (GITR, BLIMP-1, BATF). We identify a specific human eTreg cell signature that includes the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as a predicted regulator in eTreg cell differentiation. H3K27ac/H3K4me1 occupancy indicates an altered (super-)enhancer landscape, including enrichment of the VDR and BATF binding motifs. The Treg cell profile has striking overlap with tumor-infiltrating Treg cells. Our data demonstrate that human inflammation-derived Treg cells acquire a conserved and specific eTreg cell profile guided by epigenetic changes, and fine-tuned by environment-specific adaptations.",nocancer
"Curcumin is a natural bioactive component derived from the turmeric plant Curcuma longa, which exhibits a range of beneficial activities on human cells. Previously, an inhibitory effect of curcumin on platelets was demonstrated. However, it is unknown whether this inhibitory effect is due to platelet apoptosis or procoagulant platelet formation. In this study, curcumin did not activate caspase 3-dependent apoptosis of human platelets, but rather induced the formation of procoagulant platelets. Interestingly, curcumin at low concentration (5 microM) potentiated, and at high concentration (50 microM) inhibited ABT-737-induced platelet apoptosis, which was accompanied by inhibition of ABT-737-mediated thrombin generation. Platelet viability was not affected by curcumin at low concentration and was reduced by 17% at high concentration. Furthermore, curcumin-induced autophagy in human platelets via increased translocation of LC3I to LC3II, which was associated with activation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) kinase and inhibition of protein kinase B activity. Because curcumin inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in cancer cells and contributes to overcoming multidrug resistance, we showed that curcumin similarly inhibited platelet P-gp activity. Our results revealed that the platelet inhibitory effect of curcumin is mediated by complex processes, including procoagulant platelet formation. Thus, curcumin may protect against or enhance caspase-dependent apoptosis in platelets under certain conditions.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the selenium (Se) behavior when used as an endodontic dressing in teeth with pulp necrosis. Additionally, its effects was also compared with the calcium hydroxide (C.H.), which is used globally as a root canal dressing, and the combination of the C.H. with Se (C.H. + Se). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 60 patients requiring endodontic treatment who were divided into groups, i.e., without intracanal medication (empty) and with medications as follows: selenium (Se), calcium hydroxide (C.H.), and calcium hydroxide + selenium (C.H. + Se) (n = 15). After the coronary opening, three absorbent paper points were placed in the RCS and maintained for 2 min for microbial evaluation. Following the cleaning and shaping procedures, new paper points were introduced into the root canal system, passing passively through the root apex (2 mm) into the periapical tissues for 2 min, for immune evaluation. The collections were performed again 15 days later. Real-time PCR quantified the expression of the prokaryotic 16S ribosomal RNA. The 16S mRNA was evaluated before the cleaning and shaping procedures and 15 days later in the groups treated with or without medication. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the microbial load was observed only in the groups that received endodontic dressing (p < 0.05). The cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha, IL-17A, IL-10, IL-6 and MCP-1, were also quantified by real-time PCR. There was an increase in the gene expression level of the cytokines (T15) TNF-alpha and IL-10 in the C.H. group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). The IFN-gamma mRNA expression was reduced in the groups treated with the medications (Se, C.H., and C.H. + Se). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study indicate that in the case of treatment over multiple sessions, the use of root canal dressing is essential to avoid the root canal system (RCS) microbial recolonization. Selenium potentiated the effects of calcium hydroxide inducing an anti-inflammatory response in periapical tissues. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Se is a mineral essential for the formation of the amino acid selenocysteine, which is directly involved in the maintenance of the immune response. Selenium has been widely used in the medical field in the treatment of cancer, as an activator of bone metabolism, and as a stimulator of the immune system. In this study, it was shown that the incorporation of Se, whether as intracanal medication alone or in conjunction with other medications, may potentiate periapical tissue repair after RCS cleaning and shaping procedures.",nocancer
"Carbonyl reduction biotransformation pathway of anthracyclines (doxorubicin, daunorubicin) is a significant process, associated with drug metabolism and elimination. However, it also plays a pivotal role in anthracyclines-induced cardiotoxicity and cancer resistance. Herein, carbonyl reduction of eight anthracyclines, at in vivo relevant concentrations (20 microM), was studied in human liver cytosol, to describe the relationship between their structure and metabolism. Significant differences of intrinsic clearance between anthracyclines, ranging from 0,62 to 74,9 microl/min/mg were found and associated with data from in silico analyses, considering their binding in active sites of the main anthracyclines-reducing enzymes: carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) and aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3). Partial atomic charges of carbonyl oxygen atom were also determined and considered as a factor associated with reaction rate. Structural features, including presence or absence of side-chain hydroxy group, a configuration of sugar chain hydroxy group, and tetracyclic rings substitution, affecting anthracyclines susceptibility for carbonyl reduction were identified.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: We previously reported that stimulation of mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages with TNFalpha and IL-6 induces differentiation of osteoclast-like cells. The present study aimed to clarify the characterization and function of human TNFalpha and IL-6-induced osteoclasts using peripheral blood collected from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy donors. METHODS: Peripheral blood monocytes were cultured with TNFalpha and IL-6 or RANKL, and their bone resorption ability was evaluated. The expression levels of NF-ATc1, proinflammatory cytokines, and MMP-3 were analyzed. The effects of NF-AT inhibitor and JAK inhibitor were examined. Furthermore, the relationship between the number of TNFalpha and IL-6-induced osteoclasts or osteoclasts differentiated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with RA and the modified total Sharp score (mTSS) or the whole-body bone mineral density (BMD) were examined. RESULTS: Stimulating peripheral blood monocytes with TNFalpha and IL-6-induced osteoclasts with an ability to absorb bone matrix. Cell differentiation was not inhibited by the addition of osteoprotegerin; TNFalpha and IL-6 stimulation promoted NF-ATc1 expression, while the NF-AT and JAK inhibitors prevented TNFalpha and IL-6-induced osteoclast formation. Expression of IL-1beta, TNFalpha, IL-12p40, and MMP-3 was significantly increased in TNFalpha and IL-6-induced osteoclasts, but not in osteoclasts. The number of TNFalpha and IL-6-induced osteoclasts differentiated from PBMCs in patients with RA positively correlated with mTSS, whereas osteoclast number negatively correlated with the whole-body BMD of the same patients. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that TNFalpha and IL-6-induced osteoclasts may contribute to the pathology of inflammatory arthritis associated with joint destruction, such as RA.",nocancer
"Lung inflammation is a hallmark of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we show that mice develop inflamed lung tissue after being administered exosomes released from the lung epithelial cells exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Nsp12 and Nsp13 (exosomesNsp12Nsp13). Mechanistically, we show that exosomesNsp12Nsp13 are taken up by lung macrophages, leading to activation of NF-kappaB and the subsequent induction of an array of inflammatory cytokines. Induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta from exosomesNsp12Nsp13 activated lung macrophages contributes to inducing apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. Induction of exosomesNsp12Nsp13 mediated lung inflammation was abolished with ginger exosome-like nanoparticle (GELN) miRNA aly-miR396a-5p. The role of GELNs in inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 induced cytopathic effect (CPE) was further demonstrated via GELN aly-miR396a-5p and rlcv-miR-rL1-28-3p mediated inhibition of expression of Nsp12 and spike genes, respectively. Together, our results reveal exosomesNsp12Nsp13 as potentially important contributors to the development of lung inflammation and GELNs are a potential therapeutic agent to treat COVID-19.",nocancer
"Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of continuous local anesthetic infusion to the incision site with the On-Q elastomeric pump system in postoperative acute pain control after thoracotomy. Methods: A retrospective comparative analysis of of sixty patients who underwent thoracotomy for lung cancer by the same surgical team was performed between January 2016 and December 2017. The patients were divided into two groups according to postoperative pain management, those who were traditionally received tramadolol (15 mg/h) by intravenous continuous infusion (Group IVT, n = 30) and those who were administered continuous local anesthetic (0.5% bupivacaine, 4 ml/h) infusion to the incision site through an elastomeric pump in addition to the traditional treatment (Group LA, n = 30). The primary outcomes were postoperative acute pain scores on the numeric rating scale and postoperative rescue opioid consumption for 72 hours following surgery reported as pethidine equivalents. The secondary outcomes were frequency of analgesia related adverse events/complications, ICU and hospital stay, drug and total hospital cost. Results: The mean pain scores at 2, 12, 24, 48 and 72th hours at rest and during coughing were found to be significantly lower in group LA (p < 0.05). Rescue opioid consumption on postoperative 0, 1, 2 and 3rd days and in total was found to be significantly lower in Group LA (p < 0.05). In Group LA, postoperative length of hospital stay was significantly shorter (5.8 +- 2.1 days vs. 8.0 +- 3.1 days; p = 0.034), drug costs (95.24 vs. 160.08 Euro; p = 0.023) and total hospital costs were lower (434.26 vs. 685.75 Euro; p = 0.014) than Group IVT. Conclusions: We believe that continuous local anesthetic infusion to the incision site in addition to systemic analgesic treatment for multimodal acute pain management after thoracotomy is an effective and safe method.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: There is limited information about mortality rates among patients with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in North America and their change over the past two decades. OBJECTIVE: To compare all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates in psoriatic patients to the general population in Ontario, Canada from 1996 to 2016. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of adult residents using administrative health data. All-cause and cause-specific standardized mortality rates, standardized mortality ratios and excess mortality rates were calculated. RESULTS: 176,858 (2,524 deaths) psoriasis patients and 15,430 (221 deaths) PsA patients were identified in 2016. Patients with psoriasis and PsA had standardized excess mortality rates of 1.44 and 2.43 per 1000 population, respectively. Standardized mortality rates decreased by approximately 30% over the study period in both disease groups, but remained significantly elevated compared to the general population. The leading causes of death in psoriasis and PsA patients were cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory conditions. LIMITATIONS: We were unable to classify patients according to disease severity. CONCLUSION: Despite improvements in psoriasis treatment, the relative excess mortality, which may be related to risk factors for psoriatic disease, remained unchanged, with an average of approximately 1-2 extra deaths per 1,000 patients in 2016.",nocancer
"FUN14 domain-containing protein 1 (FUNDC1) is an integral mitochondrial outer-membrane protein, and mediates the formation of mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs). This study aims to determine the contributions of FUNDC1-mediated MAMs to angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. In cultured endothelial cells, VEGF significantly increases the formation of MAMs and MAM-related proteins, including FUNDC1. Endothelial cell-specific deletion of FUNDC1, which disrupts MAM formation in endothelial cells, lowers VEGFR2 expression and reduces tube formation, spheroid-sprouting, and functional blood vessel formation in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, increased MAM formation using MAM linkers mimics the effects of VEGF and promotes endothelial angiogenesis. Mechanistically, increased MAMs formation led to increased levels of Ca2+ in cytosol, promoted the phosphorylation of serum response factor (SRF) and enhanced the binding of SRF to VEGFR2 promoter, resulting in increased VEGFR2 production, with consequent angiogenesis. Moreover, blocking FUNDC1-related MAM formation with a cell-penetrating inhibitory peptide significantly suppresses the expressions of downstream angiogenic genes and inhibits tumor angiogenesis. We conclude that decreased MAMs formation by silencing FUNDC1 can inhibit angiogenesis by decreasing VEGFR2 expression, and targeting FUNDC1-dependent MAMs might be a promising approach for treating human disorders characterized by defective angiogenesis.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The health effects of heavy solid fuel use in winter in rural China are of concern. The effects of air pollution resulting from domestic solid fuel combustion in rural households on rural homemakers' biomarkers were revealed in this study. METHODS: In total, 75 female homemakers from rural areas of Guanzhong Basin, the Fenwei Plain, People's Republic of China, were randomly selected and divided into three groups (biomass users, coal users, and nonusers of solid fuel user [control group]). The differences in biological indicators, including 8-hydrox-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), interlukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in urine samples as well as blood pressure (BP, including systolic BP [SBP] and diastolic BP [DBP]) and heart rate (HR) among the groups in winter and summer were investigated using statistical analysis. RESULTS: IL-6, 8-OHdG, HR, SBP, and DBP were significantly higher in winter than in summer (P < 0.05) owing to the poor air quality resulted from the excessive use of solid fuels in winter. Significant seasonal differences in 8-OHdG were observed for both coal and biomass users. After the influence of confounders was removed, only IL-6 levels in the urine of solid fuel users were significantly higher than that of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 is a sensitive biomarker representing inflammatory responses to particulate matter emitted through household solid fuel combustion. Locally, excessive use of solid fuels in winter posed serious PM2.5 pollution in this area and adverse effects on inflammatory biomarkers in these rural homemakers and induced DNA damage related to oxidative stress.",nocancer
"Antiviral agents with different mechanisms of action could induce synergistic effects against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Some reports suggest the therapeutic potential of the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) enzyme against virus infection. Given that hemin is a natural inducer of the HO-1 gene, the aim of this study was to develop an in vitro assay to analyze the antiviral potency of hemin against SARS-CoV-2 infection. A SARS-CoV-2 infectivity assay was conducted in Vero-E6 and Calu-3 epithelial cell lines. The antiviral effect of hemin, and chloroquine as a control, against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection was quantified by RT-qPCR using specific oligonucleotides for the N gene. Chloroquine induced a marked reduction of viral genome copies in kidney epithelial Vero-E6 cells but not in lung cancer Calu-3 cells. Hemin administration to the culture medium induced a high induction in the expression of the HO-1 gene that was stronger in Vero-E6 macaque-derived cells than in the human Calu-3 cell line. However, hemin treatment did not modify SARS-CoV-2 replication, as measured by viral genome quantification 48 h post-infection for Vero-E6 and 72 h post-infection for the Calu-3 lineages. In conclusion, although exposure to hemin induced strong HO-1 up-regulation, this effect was unable to inhibit or delay the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection in two epithelial cell lines susceptible to infection.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), a diet-derived, gut microbial-host cometabolite, has been linked to cardiometabolic diseases. However, the relations remain unclear between diet, TMAO, and cardiometabolic health in general populations from different regions and ethnicities. OBJECTIVES: To examine associations of circulating TMAO with dietary and cardiometabolic factors in a pooled analysis of 16 population-based studies from the United States, Europe, and Asia. METHODS: Included were 32,166 adults (16,269 white, 13,293 Asian, 1247 Hispanic/Latino, 1236 black, and 121 others) without cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. Linear regression coefficients (beta) were computed for standardized TMAO with harmonized variables. Study-specific results were combined by random-effects meta-analysis. A false discovery rate <0.10 was considered significant. RESULTS: After adjustment for potential confounders, circulating TMAO was associated with intakes of animal protein and saturated fat (beta = 0.124 and 0.058, respectively, for a 5% energy increase) and with shellfish, total fish, eggs, and red meat (beta = 0.370, 0.151, 0.081, and 0.056, respectively, for a 1 serving/d increase). Plant protein and nuts showed inverse associations (beta = -0.126 for a 5% energy increase from plant protein and -0.123 for a 1 serving/d increase of nuts). Although the animal protein-TMAO association was consistent across populations, fish and shellfish associations were stronger in Asians (beta = 0.285 and 0.578), and egg and red meat associations were more prominent in Americans (beta = 0.153 and 0.093). Besides, circulating TMAO was positively associated with creatinine (beta = 0.131 SD increase in log-TMAO), homocysteine (beta = 0.065), insulin (beta = 0.048), glycated hemoglobin (beta = 0.048), and glucose (beta = 0.023), whereas it was inversely associated with HDL cholesterol (beta = -0.047) and blood pressure (beta = -0.030). Each TMAO-biomarker association remained significant after further adjusting for creatinine and was robust in subgroup/sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In an international, consortium-based study, animal protein was consistently associated with increased circulating TMAO, whereas TMAO associations with fish, shellfish, eggs, and red meat varied among populations. The adverse associations of TMAO with certain cardiometabolic biomarkers, independent of renal function, warrant further investigation.",nocancer
"Few cohort studies explored the associations of long-term exposure to ambient fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 mum or less (PM2.5) and its chemical constituents with mortality risk in rural China. We conducted a 12-year prospective study of 28,793 adults in rural Deqing, China from 2006 to 2018. Annual mean PM2.5 and its constituents, including black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), sulfate (SO42-), and soil dust were measured at participants' addresses at enrollment from a satellite-based exposure predicting model. Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) of long-term exposure to PM2.5 for mortality. A total of 1960 deaths were identified during the follow-up. We found PM2.5, BC, OC, NH4+, NO3-, and SO42- were significantly associated with an increased risk of non-accidental mortality. The HR for non-accidental mortality was 1.17 (95%CI: 1.07, 1.28) for each 10 mug/m3 increase in PM2.5. As for constituents, the strongest association was found for BC (HR = 1.21, 95%CI: 1.11, 1.33), followed by NO3-, NH4+, SO42-, and OC (HR = 1.14-1.17 per interquartile range). A non-linear relationship was found between PM2.5 and non-accidental mortality. Similar associations were found for cardio-cerebrovascular and cancer mortality. Associations were stronger among men and ever smokers. Conclusively, we found long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and its chemical constituents (especially BC and NO3-) increased mortality risk. Our results suggested the importance of adopting effective targeted emission control to improve air quality for health protection in rural East China.",nocancer
"Increases in human life expectancy have led to increases in the prevalence of senile dementia and neurodegenerative diseases. This is a major problem because there are no curative treatments for these diseases, and patients with unmanaged cognitive and neurodegenerative symptoms experience many social problems. Sulforaphane is a type of organosulfur compound known as an isothiocyanate. It is derived from glucoraphanin, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, brussels sprouts, and cabbages, via an enzymatic reaction that is triggered by plant damage (e.g., chewing). Sulforaphane exhibits activity against cancer, inflammation, depression, and severe cardiac diseases. It can also alleviate oxidative stress and neural dysfunction in the brain. However, there is insufficient knowledge about the electrophysiological and behavioral basis of the effects of sulforaphane on learning and memory. Therefore, we evaluated whether acute sulforaphane administration affected long-term potentiation (LTP) in organotypic cultured rat hippocampal tissues. We also measured the effect of sulforaphane on the performance of three behavioral tests, the Y-maze test, the passive avoidance test, and the Morris water maze, which assess short-term memory, avoidance memory, and short and long-term spatial memory, respectively. We found that sulforaphane increased the total field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in a dose-dependent manner after high frequency stimulation and attenuated scopolamine-induced interference of the fEPSP in the hippocampal CA1 area. Sulforaphane also restored cognitive function and inhibited memory impairment as indicated by the alleviation of the negative neurological effects of scopolamine, i.e, a lowered ratio of spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze, a reduced step-through latency in the passive avoidance test, and an increased navigation time in the Morris water maze. These results indicate that sulforaphane can effectively prevent the attenuation of LTP and cognitive abilities induced by cholinergic and muscarinic receptor blockade. Further research is warranted to explore the potential therapeutic and prophylactic utility of sulforaphane for improving learning and memory, especially in those suffering from neurodegenerative disorders.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Immunosuppressive therapy in active cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) might prevent potential life-threatening complications. Infliximab (IFX) is a tumor necrosis factor alpha monoclonal antibody proven to be effective in refractory extracardiac sarcoidosis. It is sparsely used in CS, because of its association with worsening heart failure in prior studies. The goal of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of IFX in CS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective, single center cohort study was performed in sarcoidosis patients treated with IFX based on a cardiac indication between January 2016 and March 2019. Patients received IFX intravenously at a dose of 5 mg/kg at week 0, 2, and subsequently every 4 weeks. After every six months, treatment response was evaluated within the multidisciplinary team using FDG-PET/CT, transthoracic echocardiography, biomarkers and device interrogation reports. Responder analysis definitions were based on; dosage of immunosuppressive drugs, improvement in functional class, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and SUVmax. Twenty-two patients were included (mean age 51.0 SD10.0 years, male 68.2%) with a mean follow-up of 18.9 months (6 to 44 months) of whom 18 (82%) were classified as responders. Median SUVmax on FDG-PET/CT decreased from SUVmax 5.2 [3.7-8.4] to 2.3 [1.4-2.3], p = 0.015. The target-to-background ratio decreased from 3.2 [2.1-5.1] to 1.0 [0.7-2.4], p = 0.002. The median left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction increased from 45.0% [34.0-60.0] to 55.0% [41.0-60.0], p = 0.02. The majority of patients (73%) experienced no side effects and no patients had worsening of heart failure. CONCLUSION: In this pilot study, patients with refractory CS treated with infliximab, on top of standard of care, had a reduction in inflammation on FDG-PET/CT and an improvement in LV function, without serious adverse events.",nocancer
"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs)-induced inflammation and degradation of aggrecan in human chondrocytes play an important role in the progression and development of osteoarthritis (OA). Azilsartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, has been licensed for the treatment of high blood pressure. However, the effects of Azilsartan in OA and AGEs-induced damages in chondrocytes have not been previously reported. The injured chondrocytes model was established by incubating with 5 mumol/L AGEs. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was used to evaluate the cell viability of treated SW1353 cells. The gene expression levels of interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta), IL-6, a disintegrin-like and metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type motif-4 (ADAMTS-4), ADAMTS-5, Aggrecan, and Sox-4 were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and their protein levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or Western blot analysis. Mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 pathway was surveyed using phosp-p38 level and its specific inhibitor SB203580 was employed to block the p38 pathway. The overexpression of Sox4 plasmid was transfected into SW1353 cells to assess its regulation on ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5. Azilsartan reduced AGEs-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1alpha, TNF-beta, and IL-6. Azilsartan prevented AGEs-induced expressions of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5 as well as the reduction of aggrecan. Mechanistically, AGEs treatment increased the expression of Sox4 in a dose-dependent manner. AGE treatment increased the level of phosphorylated p38. However, treatment with the p38 inhibitor SB203580 inhibited AGEs-induced expression of Sox4, suggesting that AGEs-induced expression of Sox4 is mediated by p38. Furthermore, Azilsartan suppressed AGEs-induced phosphorylation of p38 and expression of Sox4. Finally, the overexpression of Sox4 abolished the inhibitory effects of Azilsartan against the expressions of ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5. Azilsartan treatment prevented AGEs-induced inflammatory response and degradation of aggrecan through inhibition of Sox4.",nocancer
"Under-expression or overexpression of protein kinases has been shown to be associated with unregulated cell signal transduction in cancer cells. Therefore, there is major interest in designing protein kinase inhibitors as anticancer agents. We have previously reported [WR]5, a peptide containing alternative arginine (R) and tryptophan (W) residues as a non-competitive c-Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A number of larger cyclic peptides containing alternative hydrophobic and positively charged residues [WR]x (x = 6-9) and hybrid cyclic-linear peptides, [R6K]W6 and [R5K]W7, containing R and W residues were evaluated for their protein kinase inhibitory potency. Among all the peptides, cyclic peptide [WR]9 was found to be the most potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor. [WR]9 showed higher inhibitory activity (IC50 = 0.21 muM) than [WR]5, [WR]6, [WR]7, and [WR]8 with IC50 values of 0.81, 0.57, 0.35, and 0.33 muM, respectively, against c-Src kinase as determined by a radioactive assay using [gamma-33P]ATP. Consistent with the result above, [WR]9 inhibited other protein kinases such as Abl kinase activity with an IC50 value of 0.35 muM, showing 2.2-fold higher inhibition than [WR]5 (IC50 = 0.79 muM). [WR]9 also inhibited PKCa kinase activity with an IC50 value of 2.86 muM, approximately threefold higher inhibition than [WR]5 (IC50 = 8.52 muM). A similar pattern was observed against Braf, c-Src, Cdk2/cyclin A1, and Lck. [WR]9 exhibited IC50 values of <0.25 muM against Akt1, Alk, and Btk. These data suggest that [WR]9 is consistently more potent than other cyclic peptides with a smaller ring size and hybrid cyclic-linear peptides [R6K]W6 and [R5K]W7 against selected protein kinases. Thus, the presence of R and W residues in the ring, ring size, and the number of amino acids in the structure of the cyclic peptide were found to be critical in protein kinase inhibitory potency. We identified three putative binding pockets through automated blind docking of cyclic peptides [WR](5-9). The most populated pocket is located between the SH2, SH3, and N-lobe domains on the opposite side of the ATP binding site. The second putative pocket is formed by the same domains and located on the ATP binding site side of the protein. Finally, a third pocket was identified between the SH2 and SH3 domains. These results are consistent with the non-competitive nature of the inhibition displayed by these molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations of the protein-peptide complexes indicate that the presence of either [WR]5 or [WR]9 affects the plasticity of the protein and in particular the volume of the ATP binding site pocket in different ways. These results suggest that the second pocket is most likely the site where these peptides bind and offer a plausible rationale for the increased affinity of [WR]9.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: A splice product of the E6 oncoprotein, E6*, is found in cells infected with HPV associated with a high-risk for cervical cancer. Both E6* and E6 promote Dlg degradation, considered a contributing factor for the tumorigenic potential of high-risk HPVs. The full-length E6 utilizes a conserved PDZ binding motif (PBM) at the extreme C-terminus to promote Dlg degradation. In contrast, this PBM is absent in E6*. METHODS: We performed western blot analysis, site-directed mutagenesis and co-immunoprecipitation to identify the key elements required for Dlg degradation activity of high-risk HPVE6*, using HPV16E6* as a model. RESULTS: Our data indicate that only one of the two internal putative class III PBMs, located between amino acids 24-27 (HDII) of HPV16E6*, was required to facilitate degradation of Dlg protein. Substitution of the two consensus residues in this region (D25 and I27) to glycine greatly diminished activity. Whereas substitution of the two conserved residues in the putative internal class I PBM (amino acids 16-19) or the second putative class III PBM (amino acids 28-31) was without effect. Interestingly, HPV66E6* which does not promote Dlg degradation can be converted into a form capable of facilitating Dlg degradation through the insertion of nine amino acids (20-28) containing the class III PBM from HPV16E6*. HPV16E6*-induced Dlg degradation appeared independent of E6AP. CONCLUSIONS: The internal class III PBM of HPV16E6*I required for Dlg degradation is identified. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights that a novel class III PBM as the domain responsible for Dlg degradation activity in high-risk HPVE6*.",nocancer
"Marine macroalgae and their accompanying microbial flora were proved to be the reservoir of potential bioactive compounds with promising pharmacological applications. Heterotrophic bacteria concomitant with the marine algae were isolated and screened for their antibacterial potential against clinically recognized pathogens. The bacterial isolate with greater bioactive properties was identified as Bacillus velezensis MBTDLP1 (phylum Firmicutes), which was isolated from the marine macroalga Laurencia papillosa, by integrated morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization. B. velezensis showed promising antibacterial property against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahemolyticus with inhibition zone of 32-36 mm. Organic ethyl acetate extract of the isolate also displayed prospective antibacterial activity against the test pathogens (minimum inhibitory concentration 7.5-15 microg/mL), coupled with promising antioxidant (IC50 0.1-0.9 mg/mL against oxidants), anti-inflammatory (IC50 0.01 mg/mL against 5-lipoxygenase), and carbolytic enzyme attenuation properties (IC50 0.1-0.4 mg/mL in response to alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase). Significant anticancer potential against breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cells (IC50 0.03 mg/mL) coupled with lesser cytotoxicity to the normal fibroblast (3T3L) cells (IC50 0.14 mg/mL) were also recognized. The apoptosis assay could give reasonable outcome as the organic extract of B. velezensis induced apoptosis to 81% of the cancer cells while maintaining almost 60% viability in normal cells. The results put forward that B. velezensis MBTDLP1 could be used to isolate bioactive compounds with therapeutic potential and biomedical applications.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA and NIH altered clinical trial requirements to protect participants and manage study conduct. Given their detailed knowledge of research protocols and regular contact with patients, clinicians, and sponsors, clinical research professionals offer important perspectives on these changes. METHODS: We developed and distributed an anonymous survey assessing COVID-19-related clinical trial adjustment experiences, perceptions, and recommendations to Clinical Research Office personnel at the Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Responses were compared using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: A total of 94 of 109 contacted research personnel (87%) responded. Among these individuals, 58% had >5 years' professional experience in clinical research, and 56% had personal experience with a COVID-19-related change. Respondents perceived that these changes had a positive impact on patient safety; treatment efficacy; patient and staff experience; and communication with patients, investigators, and sponsors. More than 90% felt that positive changes should be continued after COVID-19. For remote consent, telehealth, therapy shipment, off-site diagnostics, and remote monitoring, individuals with personal experience with the specific change and individuals with >5 years' professional experience were numerically more likely to recommend continuing the adjustment, and these differences were significant for telehealth (P=.04) and therapy shipment (P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical research professionals perceive that COVID-19-related clinical trial adjustments positively impact multiple aspects of study conduct. Those with greatest experience-both specific to COVID-19-related changes and more generally-are more likely to recommend that these adjustments continue in the future.",nocancer
"Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis are the two major pathways for ATP production. The reliance on each varies across tissues and cell states, and can influence susceptibility to disease. At present, the full set of molecular mechanisms governing the relative expression and balance of these two pathways is unknown. Here, we focus on genes whose loss leads to an increase in OXPHOS activity. Unexpectedly, this class of genes is enriched for components of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery, in particular for subunits of the U1 snRNP. Among them, we show that LUC7L2 represses OXPHOS and promotes glycolysis by multiple mechanisms, including (1) splicing of the glycolytic enzyme PFKM to suppress glycogen synthesis, (2) splicing of the cystine/glutamate antiporter SLC7A11 (xCT) to suppress glutamate oxidation, and (3) secondary repression of mitochondrial respiratory supercomplex formation. Our results connect LUC7L2 expression and, more generally, the U1 snRNP to cellular energy metabolism.",nocancer
"Mitochondria are organelles that play a pivotal role in the production of energy in cells, and vital to the maintenance of cellular homeostasis due to the regulation of many biochemical processes. The heart contains a lot of mitochondria because those muscles require a lot of energy to keep supplying blood through the circulatory system, implying that the energy generated from mitochondria is highly dependent. Thus, cardiomyocytes are sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction and are likely to be targeted by mitochondrial toxic drugs. It has been reported that some anticancer drugs caused unwanted toxicity to mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction is related to aging and the onset of many diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondrial toxic mechanisms can be mainly explained concerning reactive oxygen species (ROS)/redox status, calcium homeostasis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) stress signaling. The toxic mechanisms of many anticancer drugs have been revealed, but more studying and understanding of the mechanisms of drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity is required to develop mitochondrial toxicity screening system as well as novel cardioprotective strategies for the prevention of cardiac disorders of drugs. This review focuses on the cardiac mitochondrial toxicity of commonly used anticancer drugs, i.e., doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, cisplatin, arsenic trioxide, and cyclophosphamide, and their possible chemopreventive agents that can prevent or alleviate cardiac mitochondrial toxicity.",nocancer
"Somatic mutations drive the development of cancer and may contribute to ageing and other diseases1,2. Despite their importance, the difficulty of detecting mutations that are only present in single cells or small clones has limited our knowledge of somatic mutagenesis to a minority of tissues. Here, to overcome these limitations, we developed nanorate sequencing (NanoSeq), a duplex sequencing protocol with error rates of less than five errors per billion base pairs in single DNA molecules from cell populations. This rate is two orders of magnitude lower than typical somatic mutation loads, enabling the study of somatic mutations in any tissue independently of clonality. We used this single-molecule sensitivity to study somatic mutations in non-dividing cells across several tissues, comparing stem cells to differentiated cells and studying mutagenesis in the absence of cell division. Differentiated cells in blood and colon displayed remarkably similar mutation loads and signatures to their corresponding stem cells, despite mature blood cells having undergone considerably more divisions. We then characterized the mutational landscape of post-mitotic neurons and polyclonal smooth muscle, confirming that neurons accumulate somatic mutations at a constant rate throughout life without cell division, with similar rates to mitotically active tissues. Together, our results suggest that mutational processes that are independent of cell division are important contributors to somatic mutagenesis. We anticipate that the ability to reliably detect mutations in single DNA molecules could transform our understanding of somatic mutagenesis and enable non-invasive studies on large-scale cohorts.",nocancer
"Precise deposition of CpG methylation is critical for mammalian development and tissue homeostasis and is often dysregulated in human diseases. The localization of de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A is facilitated by its PWWP domain recognizing histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36) methylation1,2 and is normally depleted at CpG islands (CGIs)3. However, methylation of CGIs regulated by Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) has also been observed4-8. Here, we report that DNMT3A PWWP domain mutations identified in paragangliomas9 and microcephalic dwarfism10 promote aberrant localization of DNMT3A to CGIs in a PRC1-dependent manner. DNMT3A PWWP mutants accumulate at regions containing PRC1-mediated formation of monoubiquitylated histone H2A lysine 119 (H2AK119ub), irrespective of the amounts of PRC2-catalyzed formation of trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). DNMT3A interacts with H2AK119ub-modified nucleosomes through a putative amino-terminal ubiquitin-dependent recruitment region, providing an alternative form of DNMT3A genomic targeting that is augmented by the loss of PWWP reader function. Ablation of PRC1 abrogates localization of DNMT3A PWWP mutants to CGIs and prevents aberrant DNA hypermethylation. Our study implies that a balance between DNMT3A recruitment by distinct reader domains guides de novo CpG methylation and may underlie the abnormal DNA methylation landscapes observed in select human cancer subtypes and developmental disorders.",nocancer
"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are important starting materials for cell therapy products (CTPs) used for transplantation. During cell culture, hiPSCs often spontaneously undergo morphological changes and lose pluripotency. Such cells are called 'deviated cells', which are deviated from the undifferentiated state of hiPSCs, lack the expression of hiPSC markers and become positive for the early differentiation marker SSEA1 (stage-specific embryonic antigen 1, Lewis X glycan). Previously, we identified fibronectin (FN) as a predominant carrier protein of SSEA1 secreted from deviated cells, but not hiPSCs. A sandwich assay using antibodies (Abs) against FN and SSEA1 was developed for non-destructive quantitative evaluation of deviated cells present in hiPSC cultures. In this study, a novel technology was developed to specifically eliminate deviated cells using an anti-FN Ab along with a near-infrared (NIR) photoabsorber, IRDye700DX N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (IR700), which has been used for cancer photoimmunotherapy. The anti-FN Ab conjugated with the IR700 dye (IR700-alphaFN) bound to and induced the death of deviated cells upon NIR irradiation. In contrast, IR700-alphaFN failed to stain the hiPSCs, and IR700-alphaFN/NIR had little or no effect on survival. Finally, IR700-alphaFN/NIR irradiation induced selective removal of deviated cells from a mixed culture with hiPSCs, demonstrating that the proposed method is suitable for the removal of unwanted deviated cells present in hiPSC culture for the production of CTPs.",nocancer
"A novel hybrid drug carrier has been designed, taking N-doped mesoporous carbon (NMCS) as the core and PEG-PEI as the outer shell. NMCS was functionalized with a photocleavable nitrobenzyl-based linker following a click reaction. Gemcitabine was loaded into NMCS prior to the functionalization via pi-pi stacking interactions. NIR and the pH-responsive behavior of NMCS-linker-PEG-PEI bestow the multifunctional drug carrier with the controlled release of gemcitabine triggered by dual stimuli. The NMCS core upconverts NIR light to UV, which is absorbed by a photosensitive molecular gate and results in its cleavage and drug release. Further, NMCS converts NIR to heat, which deforms the outside polymer shell, thus triggering the drug release process. The release can be promptly arrested if the NIR source is switched off. A promising gemcitabine release of 75% has been achieved within 24 h under the dual stimuli of pH and temperature. NMCS-linker-PEG-PEI produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were verified in FaDu cells using flow cytometry. In vitro experiments showed that the NMCS-linker-PEG-PEI-GEM hybrid particle can induce synergistic therapeutic effects in FADU cells when exposed to the NIR light.",nocancer
"Receptors and their ligands are important therapeutic targets for about one third of marketed drugs. Here, we describe an epitope-guided approach for selection of antibodies that modulate cellular signaling of targeted receptors. We chose CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) in the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily as receptor and a CXCR2 N-terminal peptide for antibody selection. We obtain a highly selective, tight-binding antibody from a 1011-member antibody library using combinatorial enrichment. Structural and Hydrogen-Deuterium-Exchange mass spectrometry analyses demonstrate antibody interaction with an N-terminal region of CXCR2 that is part of the IL-8 epitope. The antibody strongly inhibits IL-8-induced and CXCR2-mediated neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro and alleviates hCXCR2-dependent experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis symptoms in mice. As inappropriate neutrophil migration accompanies many diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, allergic asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer, this antibody has potential for development as a therapeutic agent, akin to anti-TNF antibodies. However, an important difference here is that the antibody targets the chemokine receptor and competes with natural ligand, rather than targeting the ligand itself.",nocancer
"The medicinal plant noni (Morinda citrifolia) is widely dispersed throughout Southeast Asia, the Caribbean, and Australia. We previously reported that fermented Noni could alleviate atopic dermatitis (AD) by recovering Th1/Th2 immune balance and enhancing skin barrier function induced by 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. Noni has a high deacetylasperulosidic acid (DAA) content, whose concentration further increased in fermented noni as an iridoid constituent. This study aimed to determine the anti-AD effects and mechanisms of DAA on HaCaT, HMC-1, and EOL-1 cells. DAA inhibited the gene expression and secretion of AD-related cytokines and chemokines including interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-25, IL-33, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine, macrophage-derived chemokine, and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted, in all cells, and inhibited histamine release in HMC-1 cells. DAA controlled mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation levels and the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells into the nucleus by inhibiting IkappaBalpha decomposition in all the cells. Furthermore, DAA increased the expression of proteins involved in skin barrier functions such as filaggrin and involucrin in HaCaT cells. These results confirmed that DAA could relieve AD by controlling immune balance and recovering skin barrier function.",nocancer
"Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, an innate immune system response, is associated with thrombogenesis and vascular endothelial injury. Circulatory disorders due to microvascular thrombogenesis are one of the principal causes of organ damage. NET formation in organs contributes to the exacerbation of sepsis, which is defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. We have previously reported that recombinant human soluble thrombomodulin (rTM) reduces lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NET formation in vitro. Here, we aimed to show that thrombomodulin (TM)-mediated suppression of NET formation protects against organ damage in sepsis. Mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 mg/kg LPS. rTM (6 mg/kg/day) or saline was administered i.p. 1 h after LPS injection. In the LPS-induced murine septic shock model, extracellular histones, which are components of NETs, were observed in the liver and lungs. In addition, the serum cytokine (interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and interleukin-10 (IL-10)) levels were increased. The administration of rTM in this model prevented NET formation in the organs and suppressed the increase in the levels of all cytokines except IL-1beta. Furthermore, the survival rate improved. We provide a novel role of TM in treating inflammation and NETs in organs during sepsis.",nocancer
"We have previously used the genetic diversity available in common inbred mouse strains to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) responsible for the differences in angiogenic response using the corneal micropocket neovascularization (CoNV) assay. Employing a mouse genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach, the region on chromosome 15 containing Basp1 was identified as being significantly associated with angiogenesis in inbred strains. Here, we developed a unique strategy to determine and verify the role of BASP1 in angiogenic pathways. Basp1 expression in cornea had a strong correlation with a haplotype shared by mouse strains with varied angiogenic phenotypes. In addition, inhibition of BASP1 demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect in both primary mouse brain endothelial and human microvascular endothelial cell (HMVEC) migration. To investigate its role in vivo, we knocked out basp1 in transgenic kdrl:zsGreen zebrafish embryos using a widely adopted CRISPR-Cas9 system. These embryos had severely disrupted vessel formation compared to control siblings. We further show that basp1 promotes angiogenesis by upregulating beta-catenin gene and the Dll4/Notch1 signaling pathway. These results, to the best of our knowledge, provide the first in vivo evidence to indicate the role of Basp1 as an angiogenesis-regulating gene and opens the potential therapeutic avenues for a wide variety of systemic angiogenesis-dependent diseases.",nocancer
"As the sentinels of innate and adaptive immune system, dendritic cells (DCs) have been considered to hold a great promise for medical application. Among the diverse types of DCs, monocyte-derived DCs (mo-DCs) generated in vitro have been most commonly employed. We have been improving the culture protocol and devised a protocol to produce mature interferon-alpha-induced DCs (IFN-DCs), hereinafter called (mat)IFN-DCs. While exploring the relationship between the expression of CD56 and the cytotoxic activity of (mat)IFN-DCs, we unexpectedly found that sorting of (mat)IFN-DCs with CD56 antibody-coated microbeads (MB) resulted in fractionating cells with tumoricidal activity into the flow-through (FT) but not MB-bound fraction. We uncovered that the FT fraction contains cells expressing low but substantial level of CD56. Moreover, those cells express granzyme B (GrB), perforin (PFN) and serpin B9 at high levels. By employing a specific inhibitor of PFN, we confirmed that direct tumoricidal activity relies on the GrB/PFN pathway. We designated subpopulation in FT fraction as CD56dim and that in CD56 positively-sorted fraction as CD56bright , respectively. This is the first time, to our knowledge, to identify subpopulations of CD56-positive IFN-DCs with distinct tumoricidal activity which is ascribed to high expression of the components of GrB/PFN pathway.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Hospitals, clinics, and health organizations have provided psychosocial support interventions for medical patients to supplement curative care. Prior reviews of interventions augmenting psychosocial support in medical settings have reported mixed outcomes. This meta-analysis addresses the questions of how effective are psychosocial support interventions in improving patient survival and which potential moderating features are associated with greater effectiveness. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychosocial support interventions in inpatient and outpatient healthcare settings reporting survival data, including studies reporting disease-related or all-cause mortality. Literature searches included studies reported January 1980 through October 2020 accessed from Embase, Medline, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Alt HealthWatch, PsycINFO, Social Work Abstracts, and Google Scholar databases. At least 2 reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed study quality, with at least 2 independent reviewers also extracting data and assessing study quality. Odds ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) data were analyzed separately using random effects weighted models. Of 42,054 studies searched, 106 RCTs including 40,280 patients met inclusion criteria. Patient average age was 57.2 years, with 52% females and 48% males; 42% had cardiovascular disease (CVD), 36% had cancer, and 22% had other conditions. Across 87 RCTs reporting data for discrete time periods, the average was OR = 1.20 (95% CI = 1.09 to 1.31, p < 0.001), indicating a 20% increased likelihood of survival among patients receiving psychosocial support compared to control groups receiving standard medical care. Among those studies, psychosocial interventions explicitly promoting health behaviors yielded improved likelihood of survival, whereas interventions without that primary focus did not. Across 22 RCTs reporting survival time, the average was HR = 1.29 (95% CI = 1.12 to 1.49, p < 0.001), indicating a 29% increased probability of survival over time among intervention recipients compared to controls. Among those studies, meta-regressions identified 3 moderating variables: control group type, patient disease severity, and risk of research bias. Studies in which control groups received health information/classes in addition to treatment as usual (TAU) averaged weaker effects than those in which control groups received only TAU. Studies with patients having relatively greater disease severity tended to yield smaller gains in survival time relative to control groups. In one of 3 analyses, studies with higher risk of research bias tended to report better outcomes. The main limitation of the data is that interventions very rarely blinded personnel and participants to study arm, such that expectations for improvement were not controlled. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, OR data indicated that psychosocial behavioral support interventions promoting patient motivation/coping to engage in health behaviors improved patient survival, but interventions focusing primarily on patients' social or emotional outcomes did not prolong life. HR data indicated that psychosocial interventions, predominantly focused on social or emotional outcomes, improved survival but yielded similar effects to health information/classes and were less effective among patients with apparently greater disease severity. Risk of research bias remains a plausible threat to data interpretation.",nocancer
"ConspectusLife emerges from complicated and sophisticated chemical networks comprising numerous biomolecules (e.g., nucleic acids, proteins, sugars, and lipids) and chemical reactions catalyzed by enzymes. Dysregulation of these chemical networks is linked to the emergence of diseases. Our research goal is to develop abiotic chemical catalysts that can intervene into life's chemical networks by complementing, surrogating, or exceeding enzymes in living cells or multicellular organisms such as animals or plants. Mending dysregulated networks in pathological states by the chemical catalysts will lead to a new medicinal strategy, catalysis medicine. This research direction will also advance catalysis science, because highly active and selective chemical catalysts must be developed to promote the intended reactions in a complex mixture of life in aqueous solution at body temperature.Epigenetics exists at the crossroads of chemistry, biology, and medicine and is a suitable field to pursue this idea. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones epigenetically regulate chromatin functions and gene transcription and are intimately related to various diseases. Investigating the functions and cross-talk of histone PTMs is crucial for mechanistic elucidation of diseases and their treatments. We launched a program to develop chemical catalysts enabling endogenous histone modifications in living cells without relying on enzymes. We reported two types of chemical catalyst systems so far for synthetic histone acylation. The first system comprised a DNA-binding oligo-4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) catalyst and a phenyl ester acyl donor, PAc-gly. This system promoted histone hyperacetylation in Xenopus laevis sperm chromatin. Using the thus-synthesized hyperacetylated sperm chromatin, we found a novel relationship between histone acetylation and DNA replication. The second system involved a histone-binding catalyst, LANA-DSH, composed of a catalytic motif (DSH) and a histone-binding peptide ligand (LANA), and thioester acyl donors, including endogenous acyl-CoA. This system regioselectively (i.e., selectively to a lysine residue at a specific position) acylated lysine 120 of histone H2B (H2BK120), a lysine residue proximal to the DSH motif defined by binding of the LANA ligand to a nucleosome substrate. This catalyst system was optimized to achieve H2BK120-selective acetylation in living cells without genetic manipulation. The synthetically introduced H2BK120Ac inhibited enzyme-catalyzed ubiquitination at the same lysine residue, acting as a protecting group. H2BK120Ub is a mark recognized by methyltransferase that plays an essential role in mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemia, suggesting the potential of the catalyst system as an epigenetic tool and a cancer therapy. We also discuss the prospects of chemical catalyst-promoted synthetic epigenetics for future PTM studies and therapeutic uses.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: Multiple cytokines have been implicated in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), but tumor necrosis factor superfamily 14 (LIGHT/TNFSF14) and oncostatin-M (OSM) have not been previously explored. AIMS OF THE STUDY: The primary objective of this study was to examine the relationship between TNFSF14 and OSM levels and survival. Our secondary goal was to investigate a potential association between these markers and the incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). MATERIALS & METHODS: We consecutively recruited 60 patients with a clinical diagnosis of aSAH. LIGHT/TNFSF14 and OSM serum concentrations were determined by ELISA. The primary endpoint was survival at Day 30, while development of DCI was assessed as secondary outcome. RESULTS: Patients had significantly higher levels of both markers than the control group (median of LIGHT: 18.1 pg/ml vs. 7 pg/ml; p = 0.01; median of OSM: 10.3 pg/ml vs. 2.8 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Significantly lower serum level of LIGHT/TNFSF14 was found in nonsurviving patients (n = 9) compared with survivors (n = 51; p = 0.011). Based on ROC analysis, serum LIGHT/TNFSF14 with a cutoff value of >7.95 pg/ml predicted 30-day survival with a sensitivity of 71% and specificity of 78% (Area: 0.763; 95% CI: 0.604-0.921, p = 0.013). In addition, it was also a predictor of DCI with a sensitivity of 72.7% and a specificity of 62.5% (AUC: 0.702; 95% CI: 0.555-0.849, p = 0.018). Based on binary logistic regression analysis, LIGHT/TNFSF14 was found to be independently associated with 30-day mortality, but not with DCI. CONCLUSION: In this cohort, a higher serum level of LIGHT/TNFSF14 was associated with increased survival of patients with aSAH.",nocancer
"Rationale: Bone homeostasis is maintained by a balanced interplay of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoclasts are derived from monocyte/macrophage lineage. Major vault protein (MVP) is known to promote apoptosis and prevent metabolic diseases in macrophage. However, whether MVP is involved in osteoclastogenesis is unknown. Here, we identified an important function of MVP as a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis and its therapeutic potential in preventing bone loss. Methods: Expression of MVP in osteoclasts was investigated in human tumor tissues with immunohistochemical staining. Next, we generated total body (Mvp-/- ) and monocyte-specific (Mvpf/fLyz2-Cre) MVP gene knockout mice to observe bone phenotype and osteoclastogenesis using micro-CT and bone histomorphometry. Moreover, we examined the effects of MVP on osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption, NFATc1 activation and calcium oscillations in vitro. Finally, we explored the clinical potential of targeting MVP in two osteoporosis mouse models and used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene to overexpress MVP locally in mice. Results: We found that Mvp-/- and Mvpf/fLyz2-Cre mice both exhibited osteoporosis-like phenotypes. MVP-deficiency also enhanced calcineurin-NFATc1 signaling and promoted NFATc1 activity, which led to enhanced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. Calcineurin inhibition using the small molecule inhibitor FK506 corrected the enhanced osteoclastogenesis in Mvpf/fLyz2-Cre group. Additionally, MVP reexpression in Mvpf/fLyz2-Cre group rescued calcineurin expression. MVP overexpression in wild-type mice prevented pathologic bone loss in mouse models of ovariectomized (OVX) and calvaria-adjacent lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected. Conclusions: Our data suggested that MVP negatively regulates osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via inhibition of calcineurin-NFATc1 signaling. In osteoclast-related bone diseases such as osteoporosis, manipulation of MVP activity may be an attractive therapeutic target.",nocancer
"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the treatment of several human diseases, including cancer and autoimmunity and inflammatory conditions, and represent a new frontier for the treatment of infectious diseases. In the last 20 years, innovative methods have allowed the rapid isolation of mAbs from convalescent subjects, humanized mice, or libraries assembled in vitro and have proven that mAbs can be effective countermeasures against emerging pathogens. During the past year, an unprecedentedly large number of mAbs have been developed to fight coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Lessons learned from this pandemic will pave the way for the development of more mAb-based therapeutics for other infectious diseases. Here, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs, including their origin, specificity, structure, antiviral and immunological mechanisms of action, and resistance to circulating variants, as well as a snapshot of the clinical trials of approved or late-stage mAb therapeutics.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Post COVID-19 seizures are relatively rare. The aim of the present study was to estimate the frequency of acute symptomatic seizures among patients with COVID-19 and to discuss possible pathophysiological mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Out of 439 cases with COVID-19 that were admitted to Assiut and Aswan University hospitals during the period from 1 June to 10 August 2020, 19 patients (4.3 %) presented with acute symptomatic seizures. Each patient underwent computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and conventional electroencephalography (EEG). Laboratory investigations included: blood gases, complete blood picture, serum D-Dimer, Ferritin, C-reactive protein, renal and liver functions, and coagulation profile. RESULTS: Of the 19 patients, 3 had new onset seizures without underlying pathology (0.68 % out of the total 439 patients); 2 others (0.46 %) had previously diagnosed controlled epilepsy with breakthrough seizures. The majority of cases (14 patients, 3.19 %) had primary pathology that could explain the occurrence of seizures: 5 suffered a post COVID-19 stroke (3 ischemic and 2 hemorrhagic stroke); 6 patients had COVID-related encephalitis; 2 patients were old ischemic stroke patients; 1 patient had a brain tumor and developed seizures post COVID-19. CONCLUSION: acute symptomatic seizure is not a rare complication of post COVID-19 infection. Both new onset seizures and seizures secondary to primary brain insult (post COVID encephalitis or recent stroke) were observed.",nocancer
"The pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by synoviocyte hyperplasia and proinflammatory cytokine secretion, as well as the destruction of cartilage and bone. Glaucocalyxin A (GLA) is an alkaloid derived from a Chinese medicinal plant that exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor and neuroprotective properties. We investigated the effects of GLA on RA-fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS cells), and collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), and further explored the underlying mechanisms. GLA inhibited TNF-a-induced RA-FLS proliferation, increased apoptotic ratios and upregulated levels of caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and Bax. GLA also inhibited the expression of IL-10, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in vitro. Levels of p-STAT3 were downregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Over-expression of STAT3 partly neutralized the GLA-mediated elevation of caspase-3 and cleaved PARP levels as well as the downregulation of IL-10, IL-1B and IL-6 expression levels. This suggests that GLA inactivated the STAT3 pathway. Furthermore, the production of inflammatory cytokines in RA-FLS and a CIA rat model were inhibited effectively by GLA. Taken together, our data suggest that GLA is a potential long-term therapeutic agent for patients with RA.",nocancer
"Cation-pi interaction is a type of noncovalent interaction formed between the pi-electron system and the positively charged ion or moieties. In this study, we designed a series of novel NQO1 substrates by introducing aliphatic nitrogen-containing side chains to fit with the L-shaped pocket of NQO1 by the formation of cation-pi interactions. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation indicated that the basic N atom in the side chain of NQO1 substrates, which is prone to be protonated under physiological conditions, can form cation-pi interactions with the Phe232 and Phe236 residues of the NQO1 enzyme. Compound 4 with a methylpiperazinyl substituent was identified as the most efficient substrate for NQO1 with the reduction rate and catalytic efficiency of 1263 +- 61 mumol NADPH/min/mumol NQO1 and 2.8 +- 0.3 x 106 M-1s-1, respectively. Notably, compound 4 exhibited increased water solubility (110 mug/mL) compared to that of beta-lap (43 mug/mL), especially under acidic condition (pH = 3, solubility > 1000 mug/mL). Compound 4 (IC50/A549 = 2.4 +- 0.6 muM) showed potent antitumor activity against NQO1-rich cancer cells through ROS generation via NQO1-mediated redox cycling. These results emphasized that the application of cation-pi interactions by introducing basic aliphatic amine moiety is beneficial for both the water solubility and the NQO1-substrate binding, leading to promising NQO1-targeting antitumor candidates with improved druglike properties.",nocancer
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to provide an up-to-date literature review to further characterise the association of kidney stone disease (KSD) with gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. As KSD is associated with significant morbidity, it is important to quantify and qualify this association to provide better care and management for the patient subgroup. OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic review of the existing literature to evaluate the association of KSD following GI surgery. METHODS: A literature search was performed of the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, Key Urology, Uptodate and Cochrane Trials from January 2000 to June 2020. RECENT FINDINGS: A total of 106 articles were identified, and after screening for titles, abstracts and full articles, 12 full papers were included. This involved a total of 9299 patients who underwent primary GI surgery. Over a mean follow-up period of 5.4 years (range: 1-14.4 years), 819 (8.8%) developed KSD, varying from 1.2 to 83% across studies. The mean time to stone formation was approximately 3 years (range: 0.5-9 years). In the 4 studies that reported on the management of KSD (n = 427), 38.6% went on to have urological intervention. There is a high incidence of KSD following primary GI surgery, and after a mean follow-up of 3 years, around 9% of patients developed KSD. While the GI surgery was done for obesity, inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, the risk of KSD should be kept in mind during follow-up, and prompt urology involvement with metabolic assessment, medical and or surgical management offered as applicable.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Faecal calprotectin (FCP) has been widely used as a non-invasive marker of intestinal inflammation in children. Measurement of faecal haemoglobin (f-Hb) using faecal immunochemical test (FIT) is well established in adults for detection of colorectal cancer. In adults, f-Hb has been recommended as a reliable tool to aid identification of those at low risk of significant bowel disease and has also been used in inflammatory bowel disease to assess mucosal healing. AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the performance of f-Hb in the paediatric population and compare it with FCP. METHODS: Children being assessed in the paediatric gastroenterology clinic for bowel symptoms had a sample sent for both FCP and f-Hb. Samples were collected over a 10-month period from November 2018 to September 2019. f-Hb was measured using an OC-Sensor. FCP was measured using LiasoniCalprotectin. RESULTS: 143 samples were returned for f-Hb and in 107 a paired FCP was also available. f-Hb correlated with FCP, Spearmanas rank coefficient 0.656 (p<0.0001). There were 35 patients with f-Hb >20 Amicrog/g and in 32 of these patients FCP was >200 Amicrog/g. 74 patients with f-Hb and 38 patients with FCP underwent colonoscopy. Patients with normal histology had f-Hb <4 Amicrog/g; f-Hb >20 Amicrog/g was associated with signification inflammationConclusion: Our study is the first to compare f-Hb and FCP in a paediatric population. Results suggest that f-Hb correlates with FCP and, as in adults, may be useful to rule out significant bowel disease. A f-Hb >20 Amicrog/g was consistent with significant histological inflammation.",nocancer
"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) isoforms are secreted as inactive complexes formed through non-covalent interactions between bioactive TGF-beta entities and their N-terminal pro-domains called latency-associated peptides (LAP). Extracellular activation of latent TGF-beta within this complex is a crucial step in the regulation of TGF-beta activity for tissue homeostasis and immune cell function. We previously showed that the matrix glycoprotein Tenascin-X (TN-X) interacted with the small latent TGF-beta complex and triggered the activation of the latent cytokine into a bioactive TGF-beta. This activation most likely occurs through a conformational change within the latent TGF-beta complex and requires the C-terminal fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain of the glycoprotein. As the FBG-like domain is highly conserved among the Tenascin family members, we hypothesized that Tenascin-C (TN-C), Tenascin-R (TN-R) and Tenascin-W (TN-W) might share with TN-X the ability to regulate TGF-beta bioavailability through their C-terminal domain. Here, we demonstrate that purified recombinant full-length Tenascins associate with the small latent TGF-beta complex through their FBG-like domains. This association promotes activation of the latent cytokine and subsequent TGF-beta cell responses in mammary epithelial cells, such as cytostasis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Considering the pleiotropic role of TGF-beta in numerous physiological and pathological contexts, our data indicate a novel common function for the Tenascin family in the regulation of tissue homeostasis under healthy and pathological conditions.",nocancer
"Metabolic deactivation by cytochrome P450 (CYP) is considered a potential mechanism of anticancer drug resistance. However, this hypothesis is predominantly based on indirect pieces of evidence and/or is influenced by interfering factors such as the use of multienzymatic models. Thus, an experimental approach for its verification is needed. In the present work, we employed HepG2 cells transduced with CYP enzymes involved in docetaxel, paclitaxel and vincristine metabolism to provide mechanistic evidence on their possible roles in resistance to these chemotherapeutic agents. Using MTT proliferation tests, we showed that overexpression of CYP3A4 resulted in decreased antiproliferative activity of 1 muM docetaxel (by 11.2, 23.2 and 22.9% at 24, 48 and 72 h intervals, respectively), while the sensitivity of CYP3A4-transduced cells was restored by co-administration of ketoconazole. Paclitaxel exhibited differential efficacy in CYP2C8- and empty vector-transduced cells (significant differences between 10.9 - 24.4% for 0.01, 0.1 and 1 muM concentrations), but neither montelukast nor clotrimazole was capable of affecting this asymmetry. Finally, the pharmacological activity of vincristine was not influenced by CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 overexpression. In the follow-up caspase activation assays, docetaxel was confirmed to be a victim of CYP3A4-mediated resistance, which is, at least partly, brought by impaired activation of caspases 3/7, 8 and 9. In summary, our data demonstrate that CYP3A4-mediated metabolic deactivation of docetaxel might represent a significant mechanism of pharmacokinetic resistance to this drug. In contrast, the possible role of CYPs in resistance to paclitaxel and vincristine has been disconfirmed. Importantly, the expression of CYP3A4 in HepG2_CYP3A4 cells is comparable to that in primary hepatocytes and HepaRG cells, which suggests that our results might be relevant for in vivo conditions, e.g., for hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, our data may serve as a valuable in vitro background for future in vivo studies exploring the area of intratumoural metabolism-based drug resistance.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether perioperative breathing training reduces the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University hospital. SUBJECTS: A total of 240 patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery participated in this study. INTERVENTION: The enrolled patients were randomized into an intervention or control group. Patients in the intervention group received perioperative breathing training, including deep breathing and coughing exercise, balloon-blowing exercise, and pursed lip breathing exercise. The control group received standard perioperative care without any breathing training. MAIN MEASURES: The primary endpoint was the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the effect of perioperative breathing training on arterial oxygenation, incidence of other postoperative complications, patient satisfaction, length of stay, and hospital charges. RESULTS: The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in the breathing training group was lower than that in the control group (5/120 [4%] vs 14/120 [12%]; RR 0.357, 95%CI 0.133-0.960; P = 0.031). In addition, PaO2 and arterial oxygenation index on the first and fourth days after surgery were significantly higher in the breathing training group than in the control group (P < 0.001). In addition, patients with breathing training had shorter length of stay (6d [IQR 5-7] vs 8d [IQR 7-9]), lower hospital charges (7761 +- 1679 vs 8212 +- 1326), and higher patient satisfaction (9.46 +- 0.65 vs 9.21 +- 0.47) than those without. CONCLUSION: Perioperative breathing training may reduce the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and preserve of arterial oxygenation after laparoscopic colorectal surgery.",nocancer
"In the present study, we evaluated for the first time the photoprotective effect of fish bone bioactive peptides (FBBP) preparation isolated from silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) discarded tissue using in vitro experimental models of skin cells exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation and stressing agents. FBBP preparation was obtained by papain treatment of minced bones and centrifugal ultrafiltration, and the molecular weight (MW) distribution was characterized by size exclusion and reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In vitro assessment of the effect of FBBP pretreatment in UVB-irradiated L929 fibroblasts and HaCaT keratinocytes revealed their cytoprotective activity. Their capacity to efficiently reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation varied in a dose-dependent manner, and it was greater in fibroblasts. A decrease of proinflammatory cytokines secretion, in particular of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), was found after FBBP pretreatment of THP-1-derived inflamed macrophages. Melanin production and tyrosinase activity investigated in UVB-irradiated Mel-Juso cells were lowered in direct relation to FBBP concentrations. FBBP fractions with high radical scavenging activity were separated by ion exchange chromatography, and two collagenic sequences were identified. All these results offer new scientific data on aquaculture fish bone-derived peptides confirming their ability to control the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and pigmentation processes developed during UV irradiation of skin cells and recommend their use as valuable natural ingredients of photoprotective cosmeceutical products.",nocancer
"The uterus undergoes distinct molecular and functional changes during pregnancy and parturition. These processes are associated with the dramatic changes in various proteins. Given that the maturation and activation of many proteins require proteolytic processing by proprotein convertases (PCs), we sought to explore the role of PCs in uterine activation for labor. First, we found that furin was the most dramatically increased PC member in myometrial tissues from the pregnant women after onset of labor at term. Using the model of cultured human myometrial smooth muscle cells (HMSMCs), we showed that furin inhibitor CMK, D6R treatment and furin siRNA transfection suppressed contractility. Inhibition of furin activity or interfering furin expression decreased connexin 43 (CX43), prostaglandin (PG) endoperoxide synthase-2 (COX-2) and PGF2alpha receptor (FP) expression and NF-kappaB activation. In mouse model, administration of furin inhibitors prolonged gestational length. However, D6R treatment did not affect RU38486- and lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced preterm birth. Furthermore, D6R and furin siRNA treatment reduced the release of soluble form of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK), while furin overexpression led to an increase in soluble TWEAK release in cultured HMSMCs. D6R treatment decreased TWEAK level in blood of pregnant mice. TWEAK treatment promoted contractility and NF-kappaB activation, while TWEAK receptor fibroblast growth factor-inducible 14 (FN14) antagonist treatment inhibited contractility and NF-kappaB activation in HMSMCs. In pregnant mice, administration of FN14 antagonist prolonged gestational length. Our data suggest that furin can act as a stimulator for uterine activation for labor at term. TWEAK is one of the potential substrates which mediate furin regulation of parturition initiation.",nocancer
"Statins are the most effective cholesterol-lowering drugs. They also exert many pleiotropic effects, including anti-cancer and cardio- and neuro-protective. Numerous nano-sized drug delivery systems were developed to enhance the therapeutic potential of statins. Studies on possible interactions between statins and human proteins could provide a deeper insight into the pleiotropic and adverse effects of these drugs. Adenylate kinase (AK) was found to regulate HDL endocytosis, cellular metabolism, cardiovascular function and neurodegeneration. In this work, we investigated interactions between human adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1 (hAK1) and atorvastatin (AVS), fluvastatin (FVS), pravastatin (PVS), rosuvastatin (RVS) and simvastatin (SVS) with fluorescence spectroscopy. The tested statins quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of hAK1 by creating stable hAK1-statin complexes with the binding constants of the order of 104 M-1. The enzyme kinetic studies revealed that statins inhibited hAK1 with significantly different efficiencies, in a noncompetitive manner. Simvastatin inhibited hAK1 with the highest yield comparable to that reported for diadenosine pentaphosphate, the only known hAK1 inhibitor. The determined AK sensitivity to statins differed markedly between short and long type AKs, suggesting an essential role of the LID domain in the AK inhibition. Our studies might open new horizons for the development of new modulators of short type AKs.",nocancer
"Imatinib, a specific Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the most commonly used drug in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. However, optimal response is not achieved in up to 33% of patients. Therefore, development of novel therapeutic strategies for chronic myeloid leukemia is critical. Betulinic (1) and ursolic (2) acids are natural pentacyclic triterpenes that exhibit antileukemic activities. In this study, we evaluated the effects of pharmacomodulations at the C-3 position of the triterpene moiety of betulinic and ursolic acids on their activity against K562 leukemia cells. Six new derivatives (1a-2c) were synthesized and evaluated for pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects in mammalian and leukemic cells. 2c derivative containing an amine group at the C-3 position of ursolic acid was the most active against leukemia cells with an IC50 value of 5.2 muM after 48 h of treatment. 2c did not exhibit cytotoxic effects against VERO and HepG2 cells and human lymphocytes, showing a good selectivity index for cancer over normal cells. Induced cell death by apoptosis via caspases 3 and 8, and also caused cell cycle arrest as evidenced by accumulation of cells in the G1 phase and decreased cell population in the G2 phase. Furthermore, co-treatment of 2c with imatinib, the chemotherapy drug most commonly used to treat leukemia, resulted in a synergistic effect. Our findings provide a strong rationale for further investigation of combination therapy using the 2c derivative and imatinib in pre-clinical studies.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND/AIM: The association between MHC class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development was identified in our previous genome-wide association study. Decreasing soluble MICA (sMICA) through MICA sheddases suppression facilitates natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity. The expression of ADAM9 in HCC has been correlated with poor prognosis, and our recent study showed that its suppression contributes to cancer elimination by decreasing sMICA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human HCC cell line PLC/PRF/5 and HepG2 cells were used. sMICA levels were measured by ELISA. Expression of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and retinoic acid receptors (RARs) was knocked down by siRNA. RESULTS: In our screening of FDA-approved drugs in vitro, retinoids were found to be efficient ADAM9 and ADAM10 inhibitors. Treatment with retinoids reduced sMICA levels in human HCC cells. Interestingly, the effects were abrogated by depletion of the retinoid receptor RXRalpha. CONCLUSION: Retinoids can be potential novel agents for HCC treatment.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological evidence for the association of soft drink consumption with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is inconsistent, and such association has not been prospectively examined in the general adult population. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the prospective association between soft drink consumption and the risk of NAFLD in a Chinese adult population. METHODS: This prospective cohort study investigated 14,845 participants [mean age: 39.3 y; 6203 (41.8%) men] who were free of liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer at baseline. Soft drink consumption (mainly sugar-containing carbonated beverages) was measured at baseline using a validated FFQ. NAFLD was diagnosed based on abdominal ultrasound without significant alcohol consumption and other causes of liver disease. Hepatic steatosis index (HSI) was calculated based on sex, BMI, and blood transaminase levels. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine the association of soft drink consumption with incident NAFLD. RESULTS: A total of 2888 first-incident cases of NAFLD occurred during 42,048 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up: 4.2 y). After adjusting for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, dietary intake, and inflammatory markers, the multivariable HRs (95% CIs) for incident NAFLD were 1.00 (reference) for <1 serving/wk, 1.18 (1.03, 1.34) for 1 serving/wk, 1.23 (1.08, 1.40) for 2-3 servings/wk, and 1.47 (1.25, 1.73) for >=4 servings/wk, respectively (P for trend < 0.0001). Further sensitivity analysis showed that the corresponding multivariable HRs (95% CIs) for incident HSI-defined NAFLD were 1.00 (reference), 0.96 (0.70, 1.31), 1.16 (0.83, 1.62), and 1.59 (1.07, 2.37), respectively (P for trend < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results from our prospective study indicate that soft drink consumption is associated with an increased risk of NAFLD in Chinese adults.

"OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effect of gingival mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes (GMSC-Exos) on lipopolysaccharide/interferon-gamma (LPS/INF-gamma)-induced inflammatory macrophages in a high-lipid microenvironment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Exosomes were obtained by culturing gingival mesenchymal stem cells (GMSCs) in alpha-MEM with exosome-free fetal bovine serum for 48 h. The control group was produced in vitro by inducing human acute monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 cells) into naive macrophages (M0). Inflammatory macrophages (M1) were made by activating M0 macrophages with LPS/IFN-gamma. These M1 macrophages were treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) to create the high-lipid group, of which some macrophages were further treated with GMSC-Exos for 24 h to form the GMSC-Exos group. Supernatants were collected, and total RNA were extracted for downstream analysis. The expression of surface markers in macrophages were analyzed by flow cytometry. The lipid accumulation level was assessed by oil red O staining. RESULTS: Exosomes were successfully isolated from GMSC medium. The GMSC-Exos group showed lower Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and cluster of differentiation 86 (CD86) expression levels than the high-lipid group, and the highest levels of Interleukin-10 (IL-10) among all groups. The GMSC-Exos group showed significant reductions in TNF-alpha levels than the high-lipid group, and significant escalations in IL-10 levels than the other two groups. Oil red o Staining showed that lipid accumulation in macrophages was inhibited in the GMSC-Exos group. CONCLUSIONS: GMSC-Exos reduce the release level and expression of inflammatory factors, inhibit lipid accumulation, and promote the polarization of pro-inflammatory macrophages into anti-inflammatory phenotype in a high-lipid microenvironment.",nocancer
"Honey has multifaceted nutritional and medicinal values; however, its quality is hinged on the floral origin of the nectar. Taking advantage of the large areas that they cover; honeybees are often used as bioindicators of environmental contamination. The focus of the present paper was to examine the quality of honey from within the vicinity of an abandoned pesticide store in Masindi District in western Uganda. Surficial soils (<20 cm depths) and honey samples were collected from within the vicinity of the abandoned pesticide store and analysed for organochlorine pesticide (OCP) residues using gas chromatograph coupled to an electron capture detector (GC-ECD). The mean level of  DDTs in all the soil samples was 503.6 microg/kg dry weight (d.w).  DDTs contributed 92.2% to the  OCPs contamination loads in the soil samples, and others (lindane, aldrin, dieldrin, and endosulfans) contributed only 7.8%. Ratio (p, p'-DDE+p, p'-DDD)/p, p'-DDT of 1.54 suggested historical DDT input in the area. In all the honey samples, the mean level of  DDTs was 20.9 microg/kg.  DDTs contributed 43.3% to  OCPs contamination loads in the honey samples, followed by lindane (29.8%), endosulfans (23.6%) and dieldrin (3.2%), with corresponding mean levels of 14.4, 11.4 and 1.55 microg/kg, respectively. Reproductive risk assessment was done based on the hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI) procedure. In our study, the calculated HIs for adults (102.38), and children (90.33) suggested high potential health risks to the honey consumers. Lindane, endosulfan and p, p'-DDD detected in the honey samples at levels exceeding the acute reference dose (ARfD) are known risk factors for spontaneous abortion, reduced implantation, menstrual cycle shortening, impaired semen quality, and prostate cancer in exposed individuals and experimental animal models.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is a neurological disorder typically found in alcohol use disorder. The fact that it also occurs in nonalcoholic patients is less well known and often ignored. For the first time, this review offers a systematic investigation of the frequency and associated features of nonalcoholic WKS in the published literature. METHOD: We included 11 recent systematic reports, with a total of 586 nonalcoholic WKS cases following hyperemesis gravidarum (n = 177), cancer (n = 129), bariatric surgery (n = 118), hunger strike (n = 41), soft drink diet in children (n = 33), depression (n = 21), Crohn's disease (n = 21), schizophrenia (n = 15), anorexia nervosa (n = 12), ulcerative colitis (n = 10), and incidental thiamine-deficient infant formula (n = 9). FINDINGS: Vomiting and extreme weight loss were strong predictors of nonalcoholic WKS in adults. Blurred vision was a common presenting sign in about one-fourth of the patients. The classic triad of WKS is characterized by confusion, ataxia, and eye-movement disorders. All reviewed studies reported high percentages of patients presenting with an altered mental status, while both motor symptoms were variably present. INTERPRETATION: The foregoing observations led to several important conclusions. First, we can see that nutritional impoverishment leads to profound brain damage in the form of WKS. Second, it seems that physicians are either unaware of or underestimate the risks for nonalcoholic WKS. Physicians must be specifically vigilant in detecting and treating WKS in patients with sudden and severe weight loss and vomiting. Third, lower doses of thiamine frequently lead to chronic Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. We noticed that when thiamine treatment for WKS was administered, in many cases doses were too low. In line with proven interventions we therefore recommend a parenteral thiamine treatment of 500 mg 3 times per day in adults.",nocancer
"AIMS: To evaluate temporal patterns in comorbidities, cardiometabolic risk factors and high atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk population at type 2 diabetes (T2DM) diagnosis by age groups and sex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From the UK primary care database, 248,619 people with new diagnosis of T2DM over 2005-2016 were identified. Among people without ASCVD, high ASCVD risk was defined as >= two of: current smokers, grade 2+ obesity, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, or microvascular disease. Cardiometabolic multimorbidity (CMM) was defined as >= two of: cardiovascular disease, microvascular disease, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, grade 2+ obesity or cancer. Temporal patterns in the distribution of cardiometabolic risk factors were evaluated. RESULTS: While prevalence of ASCVD was stable over time (~18%), 50% were identified to have high ASCVD risk (26 /38% in 18-39 /40-49 years groups), with increasing trend in all age groups. Overall, 51% had CMM at diagnosis, increasing during 2005-2016 for 18-39 years: 14- 17%; 40-49 years: 27-33%; 50-59 years: 41-50%; 60-69 years: 56-65%; 70-79 years: 65-80%. Young-onset T2DM had significantly higher HbA1c, BMI and lipids at diagnosis (all p<0.01). Proportion with HbA1c >=7.5% in the 18-39 /40-49 years groups were 58 /54%, significantly and consistently higher over the last decade compared to those aged 50+ years, male having 15-26 / 10-18 percentage points higher proportion compared to female. CONCLUSIONS: CMM and high ASCVD risk have been consistently increasing across all age groups and gender, particularly CMM in those <50 years. Our findings indicate that the ESC-EASD recommendations need to change to consider the young-onset people with T2DM as a high-risk group as recommended in the Primary Care Diabetes Europe Position Statement.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: Herein we used near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging in a pilot study to assess lymphatics in pre-ulcerative (C2-C4) venous insufficiency and determine whether involvement and/or degradation of lymphatic anatomy or function could play a role in the progression of chronic venous insufficiency. We also explored the role of lymphatics in early peripheral arterial disease. METHODS: After informed consent and following intradermal injections of indocyanine green for rapid lymphatic uptake, near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging was employed to assess lymphatic anatomical structure and quantify lymphatic propulsion rates in subjects with early venous insufficiency. Anatomical observations included interstitial backflow, characterized by the abnormal spreading of indocyanine green from the injection site primarily into the surrounding interstitial tissues; dermal backflow, characterized by the retrograde movement of dye-laden lymph from collecting lymphatics into the lymphatic capillaries; and lymphatic vessel segmentation and dilation. RESULTS: Ten venous insufficiency subjects were enrolled, resulting in three legs with C2 disease, eight legs with C3, eight legs with C4 disease, and one leg with C5 disease. Interstitial and/or dermal backflow were observed in 25%, 33%, and 41% of injection sites in each limb with C2, C3, and C4 disease, respectively. Distinct vessel segmentation and dilation was observed in limbs with C3 and higher classification, and dermal backflow proximal to the injection sites was observed in two legs with C4 disease and in the inguinal region of the C5 study subject. Overall average lymph propulsion rates were 1.3+-0.4 contractile events/min, 1.2+-0.7 events/min, and 0.8+-0.5 events/min for limbs with C2, C3, and C4 disease respectively. One subject with peripheral arterial disease, who had previously undergone bypass surgery, presented with extensive dermal backflow and lymphatic reflux. CONCLUSIONS: Near-infrared fluorescence lymphatic imaging demonstrate that, compared to normal health subjects, lymphatic anatomy and contractile function generally degrade with severity of venous insufficiency. Lymphatic abnormalities mimic those in early cancer-acquired lymphedema subjects, as previously observed by us and others. Additional studies are needed to decipher the relationship, including any causality, between lymphatic dysfunction and peripheral vascular disease and venous insufficiency.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Effective alternatives to lumbar fusion for degenerative conditions have remained elusive. Anterior total disc replacement does not address facet pathology or central/recess stenosis resulting in limited indications. A posterior-based motion-preserving option that allows for neural decompression, facetectomy, and reconstruction of the disc and facets may have a role. PURPOSE: The purpose was to compare one-year patient-reported outcomes for a novel, all-posterior, lumbar total joint replacement (LTJR - replacing both the disc and facet joints) against transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for degenerative lumbar conditions warranting fusion (degenerative spondylolisthesis, recurrent disc herniation, severe foraminal stenosis requiring facet removal, and adjacent segment degeneration). STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data comparing outcomes for LTJR patients to TLIF patients at an academic teaching hospital. PATIENT SAMPLE: Analysis was conducted on 156 adult TLIF patients who were propensity matched to the 52 LTJR patients for a total sample of 208. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for back and leg pain were compared preoperatively, 3 months and 1 year after surgery. METHODS: The implant is a motion-preserving lumbar reconstruction that replaces the function of both the disc and facets and is implanted using a bilateral transforaminal approach with complete facetectomies. Adult patients with degenerative lumbar pathology undergoing either LTJR or open TLIF were analyzed. These degenerative conditions included: grade 1 degenerative spondylolisthesis, recurrent disc herniation, adjacent segment disease, disc degeneration with severe foraminal stenosis). Trauma, tumor, grade 2 or higher spondylolisthesis, spinal deformity, and infection cases were excluded. Propensity score matching was performed to ensure parity between the cohorts. Multivariable regression analyses were done to compare the one-year results as measured by three different standards to assess procedure success. RESULTS: At 3 months, both the LTJR and TLIF cohorts showed significant and similar improvements in ODI and NRS back and leg pain. At one year, the LTJR cohort showed continued improvement in ODI and NRS back pain, while the TLIF group showed a plateau for ODI, back and leg pain. In a series of three multivariable logistic regressions, LTJR was shown to provide 3.3 times greater odds of achieving the minimal clinical symptom state (MSS) in disability and pain (ODI < 20%, NRS back and leg pain < 2) and 2.4 and 4.1 times greater odds of achieving substantial clinical benefit (18% reduction in ODI) and minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (30% reduction in ODI) as compared to TLIF. CONCLUSIONS: Here we present a comparative analysis for the first 52 patients undergoing a novel, posterior-based LTJR for the lumbar spine versus TLIF for degenerative pathology. The approach for the LTJR allows for wide neural decompression, facetectomy, and complete discectomy, with the implant working to replace the function of the disc and facets to preserve motion. At one year, the LTJR cohort showed significant improvement in ODI and NRS back and leg pain as compared to TLIF. These results suggest that wide neural decompression combined with motion preservation using this novel LTJR may represent a viable alternative to TLIF for treating certain degenerative conditions. A prospective controlled trial is under development to further evaluate the efficacy, safety, and durability of this procedure.",nocancer
"Sphingolipids are important structural membrane components and, together with cholesterol, are often organized in lipid rafts, where they act as signaling molecules in many cellular functions. They play crucial roles in regulating pathobiological processes, such as cancer, inflammation, and infectious diseases. The bioactive metabolites ceramide, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and sphingosine have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of several microbes. In contrast to ceramide, which often promotes bacterial and viral infections (for instance, by mediating adhesion and internalization), sphingosine, which is released from ceramide by the activity of ceramidases, kills many bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. In particular, sphingosine is an important natural component of the defense against bacterial pathogens in the respiratory tract. Pathologically reduced sphingosine levels in cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells are normalized by inhalation of sphingosine, and coating plastic implants with sphingosine prevents bacterial infections. Pretreatment of cells with exogenous sphingosine also prevents the viral spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from interacting with host cell receptors and inhibits the propagation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in macrophages. Recent examinations reveal that the bactericidal effect of sphingosine might be due to bacterial membrane permeabilization and the subsequent death of the bacteria.",nocancer
"Novel 5-pyridinyl-1,2,4-triazoles were designed as dual inhibitors of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Compounds 5d, 6a, 7c, and 11c were determined as potential inhibitors of both HDAC2 (IC50 = 0.09-1.40 muM) and FAK (IC50 = 12.59-36.11 nM); 6a revealed the highest activity with IC50 values of 0.09 muM and 12.59 nM for HDAC2 and FAK, respectively. Compound 6a was superior to reference drugs vorinostat and valproic acid in its ability to inhibit growth/proliferation of A-498 and Caki-1 renal cancer cells. Further investigation proved that 6a strongly arrests the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and triggers apoptosis in both A-498 and Caki-1 cells. Moreover, the enhanced Akt activity that is observed upon chronic application of HDAC inhibitors was effectively suppressed by the dual HDAC2/FAK inhibitor. Finally, the high potency and selectivity of 6a towards HDAC2 and FAK proteins were rationalized by molecular docking. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential of 6a as a promising dual-acting HDAC2/FAK inhibitor that could benefit from further optimization.",nocancer
"Chronic inflammation, which is promoted by the production and secretion of inflammatory mediators and cytokines in activated macrophages, is responsible for the development of many diseases. Auranofin is a Food and Drug Administration-approved gold-based compound for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, and evidence suggests that auranofin could be a potential therapeutic agent for inflammation. In this study, to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of auranofin on chronic inflammation, a saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA), and a low concentration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were used to activate RAW264.7 macrophages. The results show that PA amplified LPS signals to produce nitric oxide (NO) and various cytokines. However, auranofin significantly inhibited the levels of NO, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-6, which had been increased by co-treatment with PA and LPS. Moreover, the expression of inducible NO synthase, IL-1beta, and IL-6 mRNA and protein levels increased by PA and LPS were reduced by auranofin. In particular, the upregulation of NADPH oxidase (NOX) 4 and the translocation of the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) induced by PA and LPS were suppressed by auranofin. The binding between the toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and auranofin was also predicted, and the release of NO and cytokines was reduced more by simultaneous treatment with auranofin and TLR4 inhibitor than by auranofin alone. In conclusion, all these findings suggested that auranofin had anti-inflammatory effects in PA and LPS-induced macrophages by interacting with TLR4 and downregulating the NOX4-mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway.",nocancer
"The ongoing pandemic of global concern has killed about three million humans and affected around 151 million people worldwide, as of April 30, 2021. Although recently approved vaccines for COVID-19 are engendering hope, finding new ways to cure the viral pandemic is still a quest for researchers worldwide. Major pandemics in history have been of viral origin, such as SARS, MERS, H1NI, Spanish flu, and so on. A larger emphasis has been on discovering potential vaccines, novel antiviral drugs, and agents that can mitigate the viral infection symptoms; however, a relatively new area, RNA interference (RNAi), has proven effective as an antiviral agent. The RNAi phenomenon has been largely exploited to cure cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and some rare diseases. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved three siRNA products for human use that garner significant hope in siRNA therapeutics for coronaviruses. There have been some commentaries and communications addressing this area. We have summarized and illustrated the significance and the potential of the siRNA therapeutics available as of April 30, 2021 to combat the ongoing viral pandemic and the emerging new variants such as B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Numerous successful in vitro studies and several investigations to address the clinical application of siRNA therapeutics provide great hope in this field. This seminal Review describes the significance of siRNA-based therapy to treat diverse viral infections in addition to the current coronavirus challenge. In addition, we have thoroughly reviewed the patents approved for coronaviruses, the major challenges in siRNA therapy, and the potential approaches to address them, followed by innovation and prospects.",nocancer
"Nonspecific structural chromosomal aberrations (CAs) can be found at around 1% of circulating lymphocytes from healthy individuals but the frequency may be higher after exposure to carcinogenic chemicals or radiation. The frequency of CAs has been measured in occupational monitoring and an increased frequency of CAs has also been associated with cancer risk. Alterations in DNA damage repair and telomere maintenance are thought to contribute to the formation of CAs, which include chromosome type of aberrations and chromatid type of aberrations. In the present study, we used the result of our published genome-wide association studies to extract data on 153 DNA repair genes from 866 nonsmoking persons who had no known occupational exposure to genotoxic substances. Considering an arbitrary cut-off level of P< 5 x 10-3, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging 22 DNA repair genes were significantly associated with CAs and they remained significant at P < 0.05 when adjustment for multiple comparisons was done by the Binomial Sequential Goodness of Fit test. Nucleotide excision repair pathway genes showed most associations with 6 genes. Among the associated genes were several in which mutations manifest CA phenotype, including Fanconi anemia, WRN, BLM and genes that are important in maintaining genome stability, as well as PARP2 and mismatch repair genes. RPA2 and RPA3 may participate in telomere maintenance through the synthesis of the C strand of telomeres. Errors in NHEJ1 function may lead to translocations. The present results show associations with some genes with known CA phenotype and suggest other pathways with mechanistic rationale for the formation of CAs in healthy nonsmoking population.",nocancer
"Remote consultations likely will grow in importance if the COVID-19 pandemic continues. This review analyzes which methods of teledermatology patients prefer by categorizing how recent studies have defined satisfaction, conducted surveys and concluded patients respond to the different modalities of teledermatology. Using PubMed and Cochrane databases, we reviewed studies from April 5th, 2010 to April 5th, 2020 that included the search terms patient satisfaction and teledermatology. All studies that included patient satisfaction as an outcome were included, but studies not published in English were excluded. We examined domains of satisfaction, survey method, study characteristics (including patient population, country, age, study design and evidence score), findings and statistical comparisons. We thoroughly reviewed 23 studies. Definitions of satisfaction varied, but all concluded patients were satisfied with the live-interactive and store-and-forward modalities. The studies reveal that store-and-forward is appropriate for clinicians with established patients who require regular follow-up. Verified areas of care include treatment of chronic conditions, topical skin cancer therapy, wound monitoring, and post-procedural follow-up. Only four studies conducted statistical analyses. One of those studies compared patient preference for each modality of teledermatology with face-to-face dermatology. While this study reported high satisfaction with each mode of teledermatology, patients still preferred face-to-face. Favorable responses to remote diagnostic capabilities suggest that these offerings improve preference for teledermatology. With only one study evaluating preference between each modality and face-to-face dermatology, more studies should address the discrepancy. Surveys that cover all domains of satisfaction may improve assessments and identify where gaps in preference exist.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: Vascular surgical procedures have one of the highest risks of perioperative stroke and stroke-related mortality, yet the independent risk factors contributing to this increased mortality have not been described. Perioperative strokes are thought to result from a combination of embolism and hypoperfusion mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to describe the independent predictors of perioperative stroke-related mortality in the vascular surgical population using the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4) database which collects cause of death data. METHODS: This retrospective, case-control study evaluated 4,128 patients aged 18-99 who underwent a vascular, non-carotid surgical procedure and subsequently suffered perioperative mortality. Common surgical comorbidities and risk factors for perioperative stroke, including carotid stenosis and atrial fibrillation, were evaluated in multivariate regression analysis. RESULTS: Patients with carotid stenosis were 2.6 (aOR, 95% CI 1.4-4.5) times more likely to suffer perioperative mortality from stroke than from other causes. Additionally, in-hospital stroke, history of stroke, admission from a healthcare facility, and cancer were all positive predictive factors, whereas atrial fibrillation, emergency admission, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with decreased risk of perioperative stroke-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of vascular surgical population-specific predictors of stroke-related mortality can help to enhance preoperative risk-stratification tools and guide perioperative management of identified high-risk patients. Increased neurophysiologic monitoring in the perioperative period to prevent delays in diagnosis of perioperative stroke offers a strategy to reduce risk of perioperative stroke-related mortality in vascular surgical patients.",nocancer
"There is limited information on the presenting characteristics, prognosis, and therapeutic approaches of young patients hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We sought to investigate the baseline characteristics, in-hospital treatment, and outcomes of a wide cohort < 65 years admitted for COVID-19. Using the international multicenter HOPE-COVID-19 registry, we evaluated the baseline characteristics, clinical presentation, therapeutic approach, and prognosis of patients < 65 years discharged (deceased or alive) after hospital admission for COVID-19, also compared with the elderly counterpart. Of the included 5746 patients, 2676 were < 65 and 3070 >= 65 years. All risk factors and several parameters suggestive of worse clinical presentation augmented through increasing age classes. In-hospital mortality rates were 6.8% and 32.1% in the younger and older cohort, respectively (p < 0.001). Among young patients, mortality, access to ICU and treatment with IMVwere positively correlated with age. Contrariwise, over 65 years of age this trend was broken so that only the association between age and mortality was persistent, while the rates of access to ICU and IMV started to decline. Younger patients also recognized specific predictors of case fatality, such as obesity and gender. Age negatively impacts on mortality, access to ICU and treatment with IMV in patients < 65 years. In elderly patients only case fatality rate keeps augmenting in a stepwise manner through increasing age categories, while therapeutic approaches become more conservative. Besides age, obesity, gender, history of cancer, and severe dyspnea, tachypnea, chest X-ray bilateral abnormalities, abnormal level of creatinine and leucocyte among admission parameters seem to play a central role in the outcome of patients younger than 65 years.",nocancer
"The root of Dendropanax dentiger (Harms) Merr. has been used for centuries as an empirical treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in China without scientific validation. In our recent study, nineteen phenylpropanoids (1-19) with cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory activities from the ethanol extract of D. dentiger roots, indicated to have a potential anti-RA effect. This study, evaluated the anti-RA effect of 19 phenylpropanoids on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha induced inflammation in MH7A cells and clarified their underlying mechanisms. As a result, 16 compounds remarkably suppressed nitric oxide (NO) production at a concentration of 40 muM in TNF-alpha-induced MH7A cells. Among them, pinoresinol (12) and dendrocoumarin A (1) were the most effective substances, which showed significant inhibitory effect on NO production, with IC50 values of 6.25 +- 0.42 and 7.87 +- 0.67 muM, respectively. Furthermore, pinoresinol and dendrocoumarin A remarkably decreased the levels of interleukin (IL)-2, 6, 8, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), as well as prominently reduced the phosphorylation protein levels of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65, I-kappa-B-alpha (IkBalpha), protein kinase B (Akt), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) by Western blot analysis. Taken together, our findings suggest that pinoresinol and dendrocoumarin A may offer new and safe anti-RA candidates by inhibiting NF-kB, Akt and JNK signaling pathways.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Efficacy of the nine-valent human papillomavirus (9vHPV; HPV types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58) vaccine was demonstrated in a phase 3 study in women 16-26 years of age. We present a phase 3 immunogenicity and safety study of the 9vHPV vaccine in women 27-45 versus 16-26 years of age. METHODS: This international, open-label study (NCT03158220) was conducted in women 16-45 years of age. Participants (16-26 years, n = 570 and 27-45 years, n = 642) received a three-dose 9vHPV vaccination regimen (day 1, month 2, month 6). Month 7 geometric mean titers (GMTs) and seroconversion percentages to anti-HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 were assessed. Participants were followed for safety throughout the study. RESULTS: At month 7, anti-HPV 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58 GMTs in women 27-45 years were compared to those in women 16-26 years of age. The primary hypothesis of non-inferiority of anti-HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58 GMTs in older versus younger women was met. The lower bound of the GMT ratio 95% confidence interval (27-45 years to 16-26 years) was 0.60-0.67 depending on HPV type, exceeding the non-inferiority margin of 0.5 for all HPV types. Month 7 seroconversion percentages in women 27-45 years of age were >99% for all HPV types. Injection-site and vaccine-related systemic adverse events (AEs) were observed in 87.5% and 25.1% of women 16-26 years, and 85.2% and 24.1% of women 27-45 years of age, respectively; no vaccine-related serious AEs were reported and no deaths occurred during the study. CONCLUSIONS: The 9vHPV vaccine elicited non-inferior anti-HPV GMTs in women 27-45 years compared with women 16-26 years of age for HPV 16/18/31/33/45/52/58. The vaccine was generally well tolerated with a similar AE profile across the age groups. These data support bridging 9vHPV vaccine efficacy findings in women 16-26 years to women 27-45 years of age.

"A survey was conducted through a web link on the students and staff of the Universita degli Studi di Milano, Italy in the period 14-30 April 2020. It was anonymous at the source and included history of COVID-19-related questions (fever, headache, cold, cough, anosmia, gastrointestinal complaints and separately fever over 38.5 C) in the previous three weeks, and similar information on cohabitants. A total of 14 374 subjects were included. Overall, from 24 March to 30 April, 3138 subjects (21.8%) reported COVID-19-like symptoms, and 219 (1.5%) fever above 38.5 C; 217 subjects performed at least one swab. Of these, 46 were positive (21.3% of those performed, 0.3% of the total). The frequency of any symptom was similar in women and men, but fever above 38.5 C was lower in women (multivariate odds ratio (OR) = 0.65, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.49-0.85). There was a strong association between symptoms in the respondent and in cohabitants: 64% of subjects with symptoms reported at least one cohabitant with symptoms, compared to 14% of asymptomatic subjects (OR = 11.4, 95% CI, 10.4-12.6). The lower risk of serious symptoms in women, and the strong intra-nucleus of cohabitation contagiousness are an indication that at least part of the symptoms was caused by a new pathogen - SARS-CoV-2. These data, therefore, suggest that the number of persons affected by COVID-19 was much greater in northern Italy than the number of recorded cases. This has implications for the prevention, management and mortality of other serious diseases, including cancer.",nocancer
"The innate and adaptive immune systems act in concert to protect us from infectious agents and other harmful substances. As a state of temporary or permanent immune dysfunction, immunosuppression can make an organism more susceptible to infection, organ injury, and cancer due to damage to the immune system. It takes a long time to develop new immunomodulatory agents to prevent and treat immunosuppressive diseases, with slow progress. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) agonists have been reported as potential immunomodulatory candidates due to their effective activation of immune responses. It has been demonstrated that thymopentin (TP5) could modulate immunity by binding to the TLR2 receptor. However, the fairly short half-life of TP5 greatly reduces its pharmacological potential for immunosuppression therapy. Although peptide cathelicidin 2 (CATH2) has a long half-life, it shows poor immunomodulatory activity and severe cytotoxicity, which seriously hampers its clinical development. Peptide hybridization is an effective approach for the design and engineering of novel functional peptides because hybrid peptides combine the advantages and benefits of various native peptides. In this study, to overcome all these challenges faced by the parental peptides, six hybrid peptides (CaTP, CbTP, CcTP, TPCa, TPCb, and TPCc) were designed by combining the full-length TP5 with different active fragments of CATH2. CbTP, the most potent TLR2 agonist among the six hybrid peptides, was effectively screened through in silico analysis and in vitro experiments. The CbTP peptide exhibited lower cytotoxicity than either CATH2 or TP5. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory effects of CbTP were confirmed in a CTX-immunosuppressed mouse model, which showed that CbTP has increased immunopotentiating activity and physiological stability compared to the parental peptides. CbTP successfully inhibited immunosuppression and weight loss, increased immune organ indices, and improved CD4+/CD8+ T lymphocyte subsets. In addition, CbTP significantly increased the production of the cytokine TNF-alpha and IL-6, and the immunoglobulins IgA, IgM, and IgG. The immunoenhancing effects of CbTP were attributed to its TLR2-binding activity, promoting the formation of the TLR2 cluster, the activation of the TLR2 receptor, and thus activation of the downstream MyD88-NF-kB signaling pathway.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the professional practice of all healthcare workers, including radiographers. In the pandemic, clinical practice of radiographers was centred mostly on chest imaging of COVID-19 patients and radiotherapy treatment care delivery to those with cancer. This study aimed to assess the radiographers' perspective on the impact of the pandemic on their wellbeing and imaging service delivery in Ghana. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of practising radiographers in Ghana was conducted online from March 26th to May 6th, 2020. A previously validated questionnaire that sought information regarding demographics, general perspectives on personal and professional impact of the pandemic was used as the research instrument. Data obtained was analysed using Microsoft Excel  2016. RESULTS: A response rate of 57.3% (134/234) was obtained. Of the respondents, 75.4% (n = 101) reported to have started experiencing high levels of workplace-related stress after the outbreak. Three-quarters (n = 98, 73.1%) of respondents reported limited access to any form of psychosocial support systems at work during the study period. Half (n = 67, 50%) of the respondents reported a decline in general workload during the study period while only a minority (n = 18, 13.4%) reported an increase in workload due to COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSION: This national survey indicated that majority of the workforce started experiencing coronavirus-specific workplace-related stress after the outbreak. Albeit speculative, low patient confidence and fear of contracting the COVID-19 infection on hospital attendance contributed to the decline in general workload during the study period. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In order to mitigate the burden of workplace-related stress on frontline workers, including radiographers, and in keeping to standard practices for staff mental wellbeing and patient safety, institutional support structures are necessary in similar future pandemics.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Targeting enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) can represent a hopeful strategy for oncotherapy. Also, the use of PLGA-based nanoparticles as a novel and rate-controlling carrier system was of our concern. METHODS: Benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized, and their structures were clarified. In vitro antitumor activity was evaluated. Then, a modeling study was performed to investigate the ability of the most active compounds to recognize EZH2 active sites. Compound 30 (Drug) was selected to conduct pre-formulation studies and then it was incorporated into polymeric PLGA nanoparticles (NPs). NPs were then fully characterized to select an optimized formula (NP4) that subjected to further evaluation regarding antitumor activity and protein expression levels of EZH2 and EpCAM. RESULTS: The results showed the antitumor activity of some synthesized derivatives. Docking outcomes demonstrated that Compound 30 was able to identify EZH2 active sites. NP4 exhibited promising findings and proved to keep the antitumor activity of Compound 30. HEPG-2 was the most sensitive for both Drug and NP4. Protein analysis indicated that Drug and NP4 had targeted EZH2 and the downstream signaling pathway to decline of EpCAM expression. CONCLUSIONS: Targeting EZH2 by Compound 30 has potential use in the treatment of cancer especially hepatocellular carcinoma.",nocancer
"CircRNAs have been identified to exert vital biological functions and can be used as new biomarkers in a number of tumors. However, little is known about the funtions of circRNAs in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) . Here, we aimed to investigate circRNA expression profiles and to investigate the functional and clinical value of circRNAs in MDS. Differentially expression of circRNAs between MDS and control subjects were analyzed using circRNA arrays, in which we identified 145 up-regulated circRNAs and 224 down-regulated circRNAs. Validated by Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) between 100 MDS patients and 20 controls, 3 upregulated (hsa_circRNA_100352, hsa_circRNA_104056, hsa_circRNA_104634) and 3 downregulated (hsa_circRNA_103846, hsa_circRNA_102817, hsa_circRNA_102526) matched the circRNA arrays. The ROC curve analysis of these circRNAs showed that the AUC was 0.7266, 0.8676, 0.7349, 0.7091, 0.8806 and 0.7472, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that only hsa_circRNA_100352, hsa_circRNA_104056 and hsa_circRNA_102817 were significantly associated with overall survival.

The characteristics of the AgNPs were studied using a UV-vis spectrometer, Fourier transmission infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR), X-ray diffractometer (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Antibacterial activity screening was performed using the agar well diffusion method, and cytotoxicity and cell viability studies were conducted using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Results: The synthesized AgNPs were spherical and ranged in size from 5.52 to 31.96 nm, with an average size of 16.19 nm, as determined by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, TEM and EDX. A. esculentus flower extract-mediated silver nanoparticles (AME-AgNPs) exhibited excellent activities in vitro studies, particularly in vitro cytotoxic and antiproliferative studies against cancer cell lines, such as the TERT-4 and A-549 cell lines. The antibacterial effects on the Gram-positive pathogens Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes and the Gram-negative pathogens Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella sonnei were tested. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values varied with the bacterial strain. The IC50 values of the synthesized NPs for the tested cell lines were close to that of a standard drug. Conclusion: Compared to other NPs the NPs synthesized in this study were smaller in size and exhibited a higher level of antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity and apoptosis at minimal concentrations, and this is the first study on okra flower-induced anticancer and antimicrobial activities.",nocancer
"AIMS: Necroptosis, an inflammatory form of regulated necrosis mediated by receptor-interacting kinase 1 (RIP1), RIP3, and pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) is extensively implicated in liver inflammatory disease. Thus identification small-molecule inhibitor of necroptosis has emerged as a potential therapeutic strategy to prevent liver damage. In this study, we identified 5-((7-chloro-6-fluoro-1 h-indol-3-yl) methyl)-3-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (F-nec) as a novel potent necroptosis inhibitor. MAIN METHODS: To find out the potent chemical inhibitors of necroptosis, human monocytic U937 cells were treated with a combination of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and a pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. LPS and D-galactosamine (LPS/GalN) were further employed to simulate acute liver failure to explore therapeutic potency of F-nec in vivo. In addition, a specific inhibitor of c-Jun NH (2)-terminal kinases (JNK) SP600125 and its activator anisomycin are used to elucidate its mechanisms in acute liver failure therapy. Necroptosis pathway related proteins were tested by western blot. KEY FINDINGS: In this study, we identified F-nec as a novel potent RIP1 inhibitor which efficiently blocked TNFalpha-induced necroptosis in human and mice cells. Furthermore, pre-treatment of F-nec could prevent hepatic necrosis by reducing RIP1-mediated necroptosis also effectively ameliorated LPS/GalN induced acute liver failure by attenuating cell death signaling-stimulated JNK pathway activation and then suppressing JNK-triggered inflammation. SIGNIFICANCE: Altogether, this study demonstrates that F-nec is a potent inhibitor of RIP1 and highlights its great potential for use in the treatment of RIP1-driven inflammatory liver diseases.",nocancer
"Objective: Efficacy and safety of Itolizumab, an immunomodulatory mAb, in treating moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to cytokine release in COVID-19 patients was evaluated in a multi-centric, open-label, two-arm, controlled, randomized, phase-2 study.Methods: Patients were randomized (2:1) to Arm-A (best supportive care [BSC]+Itolizumab) and Arm-B (BSC). Primary outcome of interest was reduction in mortality 30-days after enrollment.Results: Thirty-six patients were screened, five treated as first-dose-sentinels and rest randomized, while four patients were screen-failures. Two patients in Arm-A discontinued prior to receiving one complete infusion and were replaced. At end of 1-month, there were three deaths in Arm-B, and none in Arm-A (p = 0.0296; 95% CI = -0.3 [-0.61, -0.08]). At end of study, more patients in Arm-A had improved SpO2 without increasing FiO2 (p = 0.0296), improved PaO2 (p = 0.0296), and reduction in IL-6 (43 vs 212 pg/ml; p = 0.0296) and tumor necrotic factor-alpha (9 vs 39 pg/ml; p = 0.0253) levels. Transient lymphopenia (Arm-A: 11 patients) and infusion reactions (7 patients) were commonly reported treatment-related safety events.Conclusion: Itolizumab is a promising, safe and effective immunomodulatory therapy for treatment of ARDS due to cytokine release in COVID-19 patients, with survival and recovery-benefit.",nocancer
"Among mammals, serotonin is predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract, where it has been shown to participate in pathway-regulating satiation. For the stomach, vascular serotonin release induced by gastric distension is thought to chiefly contribute to satiation after food intake. However, little information is available on the capability of gastric cells to synthesize, release and respond to serotonin by functional changes of mechanisms regulating gastric acid secretion. We investigated whether human gastric cells are capable of serotonin synthesis and release. First, HGT-1 cells, derived from a human adenocarcinoma of the stomach, and human stomach specimens were immunostained positive for serotonin. In HGT-1 cells, incubation with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine reduced the mean serotonin-induced fluorescence signal intensity by 27%. Serotonin release of 147 +- 18%, compared to control HGT-1 cells (set to 100%) was demonstrated after treatment with 30 mM of the satiating amino acid L-Arg. Granisetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, reduced this L-Arg-induced serotonin release, as well as L-Arg-induced proton secretion. Similarly to the in vitro experiment, human antrum samples released serotonin upon incubation with 10 mM L-Arg. Overall, our data suggest that human parietal cells in culture, as well as from the gastric antrum, synthesize serotonin and release it after treatment with L-Arg via an HTR3-related mechanism. Moreover, we suggest not only gastric distension but also gastric acid secretion to result in peripheral serotonin release.",nocancer
