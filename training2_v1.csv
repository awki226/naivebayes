"Germline epigenetic regulation of KILLIN in Cowden and Cowden-like syndrome. CONTEXT: Germline loss-of-function phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) mutations cause 80% of Cowden syndrome, a rare autosomal-dominant disorder (1 in 200,000 live births), characterized by high risks of breast, thyroid, and other cancers. A large heterogeneous group of individuals with Cowden-like syndrome, who have various combinations of Cowden syndrome features but who do not meet Cowden syndrome diagnostic criteria, have PTEN mutations less than 10% of the time, making molecular diagnosis, prediction, genetic counseling, and risk management challenging. Other mechanisms of loss of function such as hypermethylation, which should result in underexpression of PTEN or of KILLIN, a novel tumor suppressor transcribed in the opposite direction, may account for the remainder of Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether germline methylation is found in Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome in individuals lacking germline PTEN mutations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nucleic acids from prospective nested series of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and 50 unaffected individuals without PTEN variants were analyzed for germline methylation and expression of PTEN and KILLIN at the Cleveland Clinic, August 2008-June 2010. Prevalence of component cancers between groups was compared using the Fisher exact test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of germline methylation in PTEN mutation-negative Cowden syndrome and Cowden syndrome-like individuals. Prevalence of component cancers in methylation-positive and PTEN mutation-positive individuals. RESULTS: Of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome, 45 (37%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-45%) showed hypermethylation upstream of PTEN but no transcriptional repression. The germline methylation was found to transcriptionally down-regulate KILLIN by 250-fold (95% CI, 45-14 286; P = .007) and exclusively disrupted TP53 activation of KILLIN by 30% (95% CI, 7%-45%; P = .008). Demethylation treatment increased only KILLIN expression 4.88-fold (95% CI, 1.4-18.1; P = .05). Individuals with KILLIN -promoter methylation had a 3-fold increased prevalence of breast cancer (35/42 vs 24/64; P < .0001) and a greater than 2-fold increase of kidney cancer (4/45 vs 6/155; P = .004) over individuals with germline PTEN mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Germline KILLIN methylation is common among patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and is associated with increased risks of breast and renal cancer over PTEN mutation-positive individuals. These observations need to be replicated.",cancer
"Association of a leukemic stem cell gene expression signature with clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia. CONTEXT: In many cancers, specific subpopulations of cells appear to be uniquely capable of initiating and maintaining tumors. The strongest support for this cancer stem cell model comes from transplantation assays in immunodeficient mice, which indicate that human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driven by self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs). This model has significant implications for the development of novel therapies, but its clinical relevance has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To identify an LSC gene expression signature and test its association with clinical outcomes in AML. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective study of global gene expression (microarray) profiles of LSC-enriched subpopulations from primary AML and normal patient samples, which were obtained at a US medical center between April 2005 and July 2007, and validation data sets of global transcriptional profiles of AML tumors from 4 independent cohorts (n = 1047). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of genes discriminating LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in AML tumors; and association of LSC-specific genes with overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival and with therapeutic response. RESULTS: Expression levels of 52 genes distinguished LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in cell-sorted AML samples. An LSC score summarizing expression of these genes in bulk primary AML tumor samples was associated with clinical outcomes in the 4 independent patient cohorts. High LSC scores were associated with worse overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival among patients with either normal karyotypes or chromosomal abnormalities. For the largest cohort of patients with normal karyotypes (n = 163), the LSC score was significantly associated with overall survival as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.22; log-likelihood P <.001). The absolute risk of death by 3 years was 57% (95% CI, 43%-67%) for the low LSC score group compared with 78% (95% CI, 66%-86%) for the high LSC score group (HR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-2.7]; log-rank P = .002). In another cohort with available data on event-free survival for 70 patients with normal karyotypes, the risk of an event by 3 years was 48% (95% CI, 27%-63%) in the low LSC score group vs 81% (95% CI, 60%-91%) in the high LSC score group (HR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.3-4.5]; log-rank P = .006). In multivariate Cox regression including age, mutations in FLT3 and NPM1, and cytogenetic abnormalities, the HRs for LSC score in the 3 cohorts with data on all variables were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.13; P = .02), 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P = .005), and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.05-1.30; P = .005). CONCLUSION: High expression of an LSC gene signature is independently associated with adverse outcomes in patients with AML.",cancer
"Imatinib plus peginterferon alfa-2a in chronic myeloid leukemia. BACKGROUND: Imatinib (400 mg daily) is considered the best initial therapy for patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase. However, only a minority of patients treated with imatinib have a complete molecular remission. METHODS: We randomly assigned 636 patients with untreated chronic-phase CML to receive imatinib alone at a dose of 400 mg daily, imatinib (400 mg daily) plus cytarabine (20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day on days 15 through 28 of each 28-day cycle) or pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2a (90 mug weekly), or imatinib alone at a dose of 600 mg daily. Molecular and cytogenetic responses, time to treatment failure, overall and event-free survival, and adverse events were assessed. An analysis of molecular response at 12 months was planned. A superior molecular response was defined as a decrease in the ratio of transcripts of the tyrosine kinase gene BCR-ABL to transcripts of ABL of 0.01% or less, corresponding to a reduction of 4 log(10) units or more from the baseline level, as assessed by means of a real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: At 12 months, the rates of cytogenetic response were similar among the four groups. The rate of a superior molecular response was significantly higher among patients receiving imatinib and peginterferon alfa-2a (30%) than among patients receiving 400 mg of imatinib alone (14%) (P=0.001). The rate was significantly higher among patients treated for more than 12 months than among those treated for 12 months or less. Gastrointestinal events were more frequent among patients receiving cytarabine, whereas rash and depression were more frequent among patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with other treatments, the addition of peginterferon alfa-2a to imatinib therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of molecular response in patients with chronic-phase CML.

"Spectrum and prevalence of FP/TMEM127 gene mutations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. CONTEXT: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are genetically heterogeneous neural crest-derived neoplasms. We recently identified germline mutations of the novel transmembrane-encoding gene FP/TMEM127 in familial and sporadic pheochromocytomas consistent with a tumor suppressor effect. OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence and spectrum of FP/TMEM127 mutations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas and to test the effect of mutations in vitro. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We sequenced the FP/TMEM127 gene in 990 individuals with pheochromocytomas and/or paragangliomas, including 898 previously unreported cases without mutations in other susceptibility genes from 8 independent worldwide referral centers between January 2009 and June 2010. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method was developed to screen for large gene deletions in 545 of these samples. Confocal microscopy of 5 transfected mutant proteins was used to determine their subcellular localization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency and type of FP/TMEM127 mutation or deletion was assessed and correlated with clinical variables; the subcellular localization of 5 overexpressed mutants was compared with wild-type FP/TMEM127 protein. RESULTS: We identified 19 potentially pathogenic FP/TMEM127 germline mutations in 20 independent families, but no large deletions were detected. All mutation carriers had adrenal tumors, including 7 bilateral (P = 2.7 x 10(-4)) and/or with familial disease (5 of 20 samples; P = .005). The median age at disease onset in the FP/TMEM127 mutation group was similar to that of patients without a mutation (41.5 vs 45 years, respectively; P = .54). The most common presentation was that of a single benign adrenal tumor in patients older than 40 years. Malignancy was seen in 1 mutation carrier (5%). Expression of 5 novel FP/TMEM127 mutations in cell lines revealed diffuse localization of the mutant proteins in contrast with the discrete multiorganelle distribution of wild-type TMEM127. CONCLUSIONS: Germline mutations of FP/TMEM127 were associated with pheochromocytoma but not paraganglioma and occurred in an age group frequently excluded from genetic screening algorithms. Disease-associated mutations disrupt intracellular distribution of the FP/TMEM127 protein.",cancer
"The feasibility and efficacy of eccentric exercise with older cancer survivors: a preliminary study. INTRODUCTION: Older individuals who have survived cancer and the commensurate treatment often experience a reduced quality of life in part due to their impaired muscular abilities and deficits in mobility. The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of resistance exercise via negative, eccentrically induced work (RENEW) with older cancer survivors. METHODS: Older cancer survivors with a perception of moderate muscle weakness and fatigue participated in 12 weeks of RENEW. Measures of feasibility included (1) the participant's ability to progress the total amount of work of RENEW; (2) whether peak knee extension torque production became impaired; and (3) whether RENEW induced leg muscle pain as measured on a visual analog scale. The preliminary measure of efficacy included the performance of a timed up-and-go mobility test. RESULTS: The participants significantly increased the total average work per week over the 12 weeks of RENEW. Participants increased (P < .001) their work approximately 3-fold from week 3 (7.6 [5.11 kJ) to week 12 (22.1 [14.8] kJ) without muscle pain over the 12-week RENEW training period. Knee extension peak torque production improved (11%) significantly (P = .02) (pretest: 248 [92] N; posttest: 275 [99] N) after 12 weeks of RENEW. The time to perform the up-and-go test improved (14%) significantly (P < .001) (pretest: 8.4 [2.7]; posttest: 7.2 [2.3] s) after 12 weeks of RENEW, suggesting preliminary efficacy. CONCLUSION: Collectively, RENEW appears feasible and potentially efficacious for older, weak, and fatigued cancer survivors. Implications for Cancer Survivors: The use of eccentric muscle exercise may be ideally suited for older cancer survivors due to its high force and low energetic-cost capabilities.",cancer
"Weight lifting for women at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: Clinical guidelines for breast cancer survivors without lymphedema advise against upper body exercise, preventing them from obtaining established health benefits of weight lifting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate lymphedema onset after a 1-year weight lifting intervention vs no exercise (control) among survivors at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized controlled equivalence trial (Physical Activity and Lymphedema trial) in the Philadelphia metropolitan area of 154 breast cancer survivors 1 to 5 years postunilateral breast cancer, with at least 2 lymph nodes removed and without clinical signs of BCRL at study entry. Participants were recruited between October 1, 2005, and February 2007, with data collection ending in August 2008. INTERVENTION: Weight lifting intervention included a gym membership and 13 weeks of supervised instruction, with the remaining 9 months unsupervised, vs no exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident BCRL determined by increased arm swelling during 12 months (>/=5% increase in interlimb difference). Clinician-defined BCRL onset was also evaluated. Equivalence margin was defined as doubling of lymphedema incidence. RESULTS: A total of 134 participants completed follow-up measures at 1 year. The proportion of women who experienced incident BCRL onset was 11% (8 of 72) in the weight lifting intervention group and 17% (13 of 75) in the control group (cumulative incidence difference [CID], -6.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.2% to 5.2%; P for equivalence = .04). Among women with 5 or more lymph nodes removed, the proportion who experienced incident BCRL onset was 7% (3 of 45) in the weight lifting intervention group and 22% (11 of 49) in the control group (CID, -15.0%; 95% CI, -18.6% to -11.4%; P for equivalence = .003). Clinician-defined BCRL onset occurred in 1 woman in the weight lifting intervention group and 3 women in the control group (1.5% vs 4.4%, P for equivalence = .12). CONCLUSION: In breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, a program of slowly progressive weight lifting compared with no exercise did not result in increased incidence of lymphedema.

"Comparing the volume of gliomas in the brain in FLAIR and post-contrast T1-weighted MRI sequences. The imaging modality used to diagnose and monitor brain gliomas is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with standard protocols including contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image sequences. Many clinical trials are currently using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image sequences to evaluate tumor response to treatment, but it is our hypothesis that FLAIR sequences will detect higher tumor volumes and, therefore, should be the preferred image sequence for this purpose. In this retrospective study, a volumetric analysis was conducted on the post-contrast T1-weighted and FLAIR MR image sequences of 38 patients with confirmed brain gliomas. The two volumes were subsequently found to have a statistically significant positive correlation. The FLAIR volume was also found to be greater than the post-contrast T1-weighted volume in all 38 patients. As a result, FLAIR image sequences provide a more complete characterization of gliomas and may be more beneficial when observing tumor response after treatment.",cancer

"Low-dose aspirin use and performance of immunochemical fecal occult blood tests. CONTEXT: Immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (iFOBTs) are potentially promising tools for colorectal cancer screening. Low-dose aspirin use, which increases the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding, is common in the target population for colorectal cancer screening. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of low-dose aspirin use with the performance of 2 quantitative iFOBTs in a large sample of patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Diagnostic study conducted from 2005 through 2009 at internal medicine and gastroenterology practices in southern Germany including 1979 patients (mean age, 62.1 years): 233 regular users of low-dose aspirin (167 men, 67 women) and 1746 who never used low-dose aspirin (809 men, 937 women). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms (colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma) with 2 quantitative iFOBTs. RESULTS: Advanced neoplasms were found in 24 users (10.3%) and 181 nonusers (10.4%) of low-dose aspirin. At the cut point recommended by the manufacturer, sensitivities of the 2 tests were 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.9%-87.4%) for users compared with 35.9% (95% CI, 28.9%-43.4%) for nonusers and 58.3% (95% CI, 36.6%-77.9%) for users compared with 32.0% (95% CI, 25.3%-39.4%) for nonusers (P = .001 and P = .01, respectively). Specificities were 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%-90.1%) for users compared with 89.2% (95% CI, 87.6%-90.7%) for nonusers and 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%-90.1%) for users compared with 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%-92.4%) for nonusers (P = .13 and P = .01, respectively). The areas under the ROC curve were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68-0.90) for users compared with 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.71) for nonusers and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.62-0.85) for users compared with 0.65 (95% CI, 0.61-0.69) for nonusers (P = .05 and P = .17, respectively). Among men, who composed the majority of low-dose aspirin users, the areas under the ROC curve were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76-0.98) for users compared with 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.74) for nonusers and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.68-0.93) for users compared with 0.67 (95% CI, 0.61-0.72) for nonusers (P = .003 and P = .04, respectively). CONCLUSION: For 2 iFOBTs, use of low-dose aspirin compared with no aspirin was associated with a markedly higher sensitivity for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms, with only a slightly lower specificity.",cancer
"Pediatric anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as generalized lymphadenopathy. Because a finding of generalized lymphadenopathy can be associated with such a wide range of diseases and conditions, determining its cause can sometimes be challenging. Infectious causes are the most common; however, it is important also to consider other entities in the workup. Here we present the case of a 3-year-old girl with generalized lymphadenopathy and fever, in whom the cause of the symptoms was initially thought to be infectious. Ultimately, however, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was diagnosed. Using this case as a backdrop, we discuss the wide range of systemic illnesses that the differential diagnosis of generalized lymphadenopathy encompasses--including infectious, autoimmune, and oncological disorders. We discuss the different findings typically seen in the various entities that figure prominently in the differential, and we outline investigations that can help narrow it. Finally, we present an overview of ALCL, one of the more rare pediatric malignancies.",cancer
"Head and neck cancer: changing epidemiology and public health implications. Characterizing the epidemiology of head and neck cancers is challenging and has received limited attention in the medical literature. Traditionally, 80%-90% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) have been attributed to tobacco and alcohol use, but with growing public awareness and tobacco control efforts over the past few decades, there has been a downward trend in smoking prevalence in the US. There is also emerging evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for inconsistencies in HNSCC trends, with oncogenic HPV DNA found in approximately half of oropharyngeal cancers and in a high proportion of oropharyngeal cancers in nonsmokers and nondrinkers. The risk to HNSCC epidemiology is that whatever gains continue to be made in tobacco control may become lost in the increasing numbers of oropharyngeal cancers due to HPV. The purpose of this review is to explore the changing epidemiology of HNSCC, focusing on how it has been shaped by health policy and advocacy interventions and how it will continue to have public health implications in the future, particularly in considering preventive strategies against HPV. Given that the majority of HNSCCs are the result of exposure to preventable public health risks, more focus should be given to this area.",cancer
"Systemic approaches for multifocal bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: is there an appropriate target? Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a subset of pulmonary adenocarcinoma characterized by distinct and unique pathological, molecular, radiographic, and clinical features. While the incidence of pure BAC is rare, comprising only 1% to 4% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mixed subtypes (including BAC with focal invasion and adenocarcinoma with BAC features) represent as much as 20% of adenocarcinomas--and that figure may be increasing. Despite the longstanding recognition of this entity, there is no established treatment paradigm for patients with multifocal BAC, resulting in competing approaches and treatment controversies. Current options for multifocal BAC include both surgery and systemic therapies. Unfortunately, prospective data on systemic approaches are limited by study design and small patient numbers; there are only seven phase II studies involving four therapies. This article evaluates key characteristics of BAC, including the current understanding of histopathology and tumor biology. In addition, it comprehensively reviews the systemic phase II studies in an attempt to clarify the therapeutic challenges in this disease. It also includes the first proposed treatment paradigm that integrates both EGFR mutational status and the sub-histologies, mucinous and nonmucinous BAC.",cancer

"A short account of cancer--specifically in relation to squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer is the outcome of a complex multifactorial process of cytogenetic and epigenetic changes that affect cell cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA repair mechanisms and cell differentiation. Cancer cells have the capacity to evade the immune system, to invade tissues and to metastasize. Cancer is treated by surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, each as single treatment modalities or more often in combination. Failure of treatment to cure a patient of cancer may be owing to the fact that radiotherapy and chemotherapy can eradicate transit-amplifying cells which are characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and prolonged survival; but cannot eradicate all cancer stem cells that divide slowly, have a relatively unlimited self-renewal capacity and express anti-apoptotic genes; and also owing to the fact that surgery cannot always eliminate occult fields of pre-cancerization.",cancer

"Effect of mitoxantrone on outcome of children with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL R3): an open-label randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Although survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has improved greatly in the past two decades, the outcome of those who relapse has remained static. We investigated the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who relapsed on present therapeutic regimens. METHODS: This open-label randomised trial was undertaken in 22 centres in the UK and Ireland and nine in Australia and New Zealand. Patients aged 1-18 years with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were stratified into high-risk, intermediate-risk, and standard-risk groups on the basis of duration of first complete remission, site of relapse, and immunophenotype. All patients were allocated to receive either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in induction by stratified concealed randomisation. Neither patients nor those giving interventions were masked. After three blocks of therapy, all high-risk group patients and those from the intermediate group with postinduction high minimal residual disease (>/=10(-4) cells) received an allogenic stem-cell transplant. Standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with postinduction low minimal residual disease (<10(-4) cells) continued chemotherapy. The primary outcome was progression-free survival and the method of analysis was intention-to-treat. Randomisation was stopped in December, 2007 because of differences in progression-free and overall survival between the two groups. This trial is registered, reference number ISCRTN45724312. FINDINGS: Of 239 registered patients, 216 were randomly assigned to either idarubicin (109 analysed) or mitoxantrone (103 analysed). Estimated 3-year progression-free survival was 35.9% (95% CI 25.9-45.9) in the idarubicin group versus 64.6% (54.2-73.2) in the mitoxantrone group (p=0.0004), and 3-year overall survival was 45.2% (34.5-55.3) versus 69.0% (58.5-77.3; p=0.004). Differences in progression-free survival between groups were mainly related to a decrease in disease events (progression, second relapse, disease-related deaths; HR 0.56, 0.34-0.92, p=0.007) rather than an increase in adverse treatment effects (treatment death, second malignancy; HR 0.52, 0.24-1.11, p=0.11). INTERPRETATION: As compared with idarubicin, mitoxantrone conferred a significant benefit in progression-free and overall survival in children with relapsed acute lymphobastic leukaemia, a potentially useful clinical finding that warrants further investigation.

"First-line treatment with zoledronic acid as compared with clodronic acid in multiple myeloma (MRC Myeloma IX): a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of skeletal events in patients with malignant bone disease, and zoledronic acid has shown potential anticancer effects in preclinical and clinical studies. We aimed to establish whether bisphosphonates can affect clinical outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma. METHODS: Patients of age 18 years or older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were enrolled from 120 centres in the UK. Computer-generated randomisation sequence was used to allocate patients equally, via an automated telephone service, to receive 4 mg zoledronic acid as an infusion every 3-4 weeks or 1600 mg oral clodronic acid daily. Patients also received intensive or non-intensive induction chemotherapy. No investigators, staff, or patients were masked to treatment allocation, and bisphosphonate and maintenance therapy continued at least until disease progression. The primary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate. We assessed between-group differences with Cox proportional hazards models for progression-free survival and overall survival, and with logistic regression models for overall response rate. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN68454111. FINDINGS: 1970 patients were enrolled between May, 2003, and November, 2007, of whom 1960 were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis: 981 in the zoledronic acid group (555 on intensive chemotherapy, 426 on non-intensive chemotherapy); and 979 on clodronic acid (556 on intensive chemotherapy, 423 on non-intensive chemotherapy). The treatment cutoff was Oct 5, 2009, with patients receiving bisphosphonates for a median of 350 days (IQR 137-632) before disease progression, with a median of 3.7 years' follow-up (IQR 2.9-4.7). Zoledronic acid reduced mortality by 16% (95% CI 4-26) versus clodronic acid (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96; p=0.0118), and extended median overall survival by 5.5 months (50.0 months, IQR 21.0 to not reached vs 44.5 months, IQR 16.5 to not reached; p=0.04). Zoledronic acid also significantly improved progression-free survival by 12% (95% CI 2-20) versus clodronic acid (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; p=0.0179), and increased median progression-free survival by 2.0 months (19.5 months, IQR 9.0-38.0 vs 17.5 months, IQR 8.5-34.0; p=0.07). Rates of complete, very good partial, or partial response did not differ significantly between the zoledronic acid and clodronic acid groups for patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy (432 patients [78%] vs 422 [76%]; p=0.43) or non-intensive induction chemotherapy (215 [50%] vs 195 [46%]; p=0.18). Both bisphosphonates were generally well tolerated, with similar occurrence of acute renal failure and treatment-emergent serious adverse events, but zoledronic acid was associated with higher rates of confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw (35 [4%]) than was clodronic acid (3 [<1%]). INTERPRETATION: Consistent with the potential anticancer activity of zoledronic acid, overall survival improved independently of prevention of skeletal-related events, showing that zoledronic acid has treatment benefits beyond bone health. These findings support immediate treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, not only for prevention of skeletal-related events, but also for potential antimyeloma benefits.

"Complete remission and early death after intensive chemotherapy in patients aged 60 years or older with acute myeloid leukaemia: a web-based application for prediction of outcomes. BACKGROUND: About 50% of patients (age >/=60 years) who have acute myeloid leukaemia and are otherwise medically healthy (ie, able to undergo intensive chemotherapy) achieve a complete remission (CR) after intensive chemotherapy, but with a substantially increased risk of early death (ED) compared with younger patients. We verified the association of standard clinical and laboratory variables with CR and ED and developed a web-based application for risk assessment of intensive chemotherapy in these patients. METHODS: Multivariate regression analysis was used to develop risk scores with or without knowledge of the cytogenetic and molecular risk profiles for a cohort of 1406 patients (aged >/=60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, who were treated with two courses of intensive induction chemotherapy (tioguanine, standard-dose cytarabine, and daunorubicin followed by high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone; or with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in the first and second induction courses) in the German Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Cooperative Group 1999 study. Risk prediction was validated in an independent cohort of 801 patients (aged >60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia who were given two courses of cytarabine and daunorubicin in the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia 1996 study. FINDINGS: Body temperature, age, de-novo leukaemia versus leukaemia secondary to cytotoxic treatment or an antecedent haematological disease, haemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen, and serum concentration of lactate dehydrogenase were significantly associated with CR or ED. The probability of CR with knowledge of cytogenetic and molecular risk (score 1) was from 12% to 91%, and without knowledge (score 2) from 21% to 80%. The predicted risk of ED was from 6% to 69% for score 1 and from 7% to 63% for score 2. The predictive power of the risk scores was confirmed in the independent patient cohort (CR score 1, from 10% to 91%; CR score 2, from 16% to 80%; ED score 1, from 6% to 69%; and ED score 2, from 7% to 61%). INTERPRETATION: The scores for acute myeloid leukaemia can be used to predict the probability of CR and the risk of ED in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, for whom intensive induction chemotherapy is planned. This information can help physicians with difficult decisions for treatment of these patients. FUNDING: Deutsche Krebshilfe and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.",cancer
"Autophagy and metabolism. Autophagy is a process of self-cannibalization. Cells capture their own cytoplasm and organelles and consume them in lysosomes. The resulting breakdown products are inputs to cellular metabolism, through which they are used to generate energy and to build new proteins and membranes. Autophagy preserves the health of cells and tissues by replacing outdated and damaged cellular components with fresh ones. In starvation, it provides an internal source of nutrients for energy generation and, thus, survival. A powerful promoter of metabolic homeostasis at both the cellular and whole-animal level, autophagy prevents degenerative diseases. It does have a downside, however--cancer cells exploit it to survive in nutrient-poor tumors.",cancer
"The control of the metabolic switch in cancers by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Cells from some tumors use an altered metabolic pattern compared with that of normal differentiated adult cells in the body. Tumor cells take up much more glucose and mainly process it through aerobic glycolysis, producing large quantities of secreted lactate with a lower use of oxidative phosphorylation that would generate more adenosine triphosphate (ATP), water, and carbon dioxide. This is the Warburg effect, which provides substrates for cell growth and division and free energy (ATP) from enhanced glucose use. This metabolic switch places the emphasis on producing intermediates for cell growth and division, and it is regulated by both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in a number of key cancer-producing pathways. Blocking these metabolic pathways or restoring these altered pathways could lead to a new approach in cancer treatments.",cancer
"On getting there from here. Studies on a variety of interesting biological problems, ranging from circadian rhythm to cancer cell growth to longevity, have begun to give evidence that the physiological state of cells and tissues reflects both the cell's regulatory systems and its state of intermediary metabolism. It is appreciated that the regulatory state of a cell or tissue, as driven by transcription factors and signaling pathways, can impose itself upon the dynamics of metabolic state. It follows that the reciprocal must also be the case, that metabolic state will feed back to impose itself on regulatory state. An appreciation and understanding of this reciprocity may be required to crack open problems in biological research that have heretofore been insoluble.",cancer
Late effects of cancer and cancer therapy on oral health and quality of life. Persisting and chronic oral complications of cancer therapy are common.

"The anterior extraperitoneal approach to the rare presacral/ retroperitoneal schwannoma. Presacral/retroperitoneal schwannomas are extremely unusual and their surgical approach is challenging. Various surgical approaches have been proposed. Here we describe our experience with the anterior extraperitoneal approach for the Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. A 33-year-old woman presented with a history of infertility and a presacral/retroperitoneal mass. The patient underwent abdominal/pelvic CT and MRI that demonstrated presence of a solid, well circumscribed Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. The anterior extraperitoneal approach was successfully used to remove the presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. The histopathological evaluation confirmed the preoperative diagnosis. The anterior extraperitoneal approach is helpful as an alternative approach in the surgical management of benign Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannomas (Fig. 4, Ref. 15).",cancer
"Recurrent multiple cardiac myxomas. BACKGROUND: The recurrence of cardiac myxoma after a surgical excision is a rare condition. The mechanism responsible for the recurrence remains unclear. Multifocal growth of a benign myxoma or malignant transformation, inadequate resection, intraoperative implantation or embolization, familial disposition, and the abnormal DNA ploidy pattern play an important role in development of recurrent myxoma. CASE: We report the case of a 24-year-old female with recurrent multiple cardiac myxomas. She had an abortus 2 months ago. The patient had undergone a resection of left atrial and right ventricular myxoma with extension to the right pulmonary artery 8 years ago. The preoperative echocardiographic examinations revealed recurrent left atrial and right and left ventricular myxomas. The patient underwent a redo-surgery and, in addition to a large myxoma in the right ventricle with involvement of the tricuspid valve and anterior papillary muscle, three myxomas including both myxomas originating at the top and the base of the posterior papillary muscle, respectively, the other myxoma between both papillary muscles in the posterior wall of the left ventricle, and 2 more small myxomas including 1 in the interatrial septum and the other on atrial surface of anterior mitral annulus were found in the left ventricle and atrium. The myxomas were successfully excised through a transmitral approach with a combined bi-atrial incision. The tricuspid valve and mitral valve were repaired with annuloplasty. She had an uneventful postoperative course and no residual myxoma was found by echocardiography. CONCLUSION: We think that a long-term follow-up by echocardiography in all patients after the resection of myxoma is advised for an early detection of any recurrence (Fig. 5, Ref. 9).",cancer
"Ileus, pregnancy or leiomyoma? A case of a large intraabdominal tumor. OBJECTIVE: Authors evaluate a case of an extremely large leiomyoma, its symptomatology, diagnosis and surgical treatment. They present the possible peroperative complications and emphasize the necessity of the interdisciplinary approach. METHODS: The set of patients consists of 21 patients with leiomyomas of various localizations. All patients were operated by means of conventional operation. The material was sent for classical bioptic examination with the use of immuno-histochemical analysis. RESULTS: Unlike found in literature, the most common appearance of leiomyoma in our set of patients was on small bowel, namely 10 of 21 patients had tumors in this localization. Furthermore there were three tumors of gynecological origin. Two of them had acute abdominal disease (AAD) while in these cases, ileus was a reason for urgent operations. In all three gynecological cases it was difficult to diagnose preoperatively the origin of tumors. In one patient, the preparation led to partial iatrogenic lesion of left ureter which was subsequently treated with primary suture. The authors describe zero mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively simple diagnosis of leiomyomas, in some cases of extreme size of the tumor combined with its localization in the small pelvis makes it difficult to distinguish it from other mesenchymal tumors. In order eliminate the peroperative complications it is possible to introduce a urethral catheter and to set up a multidisciplinary operation team to achieve combined experience (Fig. 5, Ref. 14).",cancer
"Adjuvant docetaxel for high-risk, node-negative breast cancer. BACKGROUND: A regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) is superior to a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) when used as adjuvant therapy in women with node-positive breast cancer. The value of taxanes in the treatment of node-negative disease has not been determined. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1060 women with axillary-node-negative breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor for recurrence (according to the 1998 St. Gallen criteria) to treatment with TAC or FAC every 3 weeks for six cycles after surgery. The primary end point was disease-free survival after at least 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 77 months, the proportion of patients alive and disease-free was higher among the 539 women in the TAC group (87.8%) than among the 521 women in the FAC group (81.8%), representing a 32% reduction in the risk of recurrence with TAC (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.93; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). This benefit was consistent, regardless of hormone-receptor status, menopausal status, or number of high-risk factors. The difference in survival rates (TAC, 95.2%; FAC, 93.5%) was not significant (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.26); however, the number of events was small (TAC, 26; FAC, 34). Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 28.2% with TAC and 17.0% with FAC (P<0.001). Toxicity associated with TAC was diminished when primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was provided. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with adjuvant FAC, adjuvant TAC improved the rate of disease-free survival among women with high-risk, node-negative breast cancer.

"Using activated carbon nanoparticles to decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity of anticancer therapeutic agents. One of the key obstacles against the success in cancer chemotherapy is the toxic and side effects of the chemotherapeutic agents. The avoidance of these toxic and side effects will greatly improve the therapeutic effects of anticancer drugs while decrease the pains of the patients. Here we show that activated carbon nanoparticles (ACNP), one of the mesoporous nanoparticles, can decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity of mitomycin C (MMC). To study the effects of ACNP on genotoxicity and teratogenicity of MMC, methods of PCE micronucleus test, Chinese hamster lung cell chromosome aberration experiment and rat teratogenicity were employed to observe the differences in genotoxicity and teratogenicity between ACNP-adsorbed MMC (ACNP-MMC) and free MMC. Results demonstrated that free MMC 0.16-5.0 microg/kg significantly increased the positive rate of PCE micronucleus test, the chromosome aberration rate and rat teratogenecity, but ACNP-MMC did not increased these heredity and reproduction toxicological indexes in a dose range of 0.625-10.0 microg/kg. From these results, it can be concluded that ACNP-MMC have significant effects to decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity effects of MMC. These results will have a considerable impact on the strategy of anticancer chemotherapy.",cancer
"In vitro cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on human glioma cells. With rapid development of nanotechnology, concerns about the possible adverse health effects on human beings by using nanomaterials have been raised. Transparent yellow iron oxide (alpha-FeOOH) nanoparticles have been widely used in paints, plastic, rubber, building materials, papermaking, food products and pharmaceutical industry, thus the potential health implications by the exposure should be considered. The purpose of this study is to assess the cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on U251 human glioma cells. The alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles are in clubbed shapes with 9 nm in diameter and 43 nm long. The specific surface area is 115.3 m2/g. After physicochemical characterization of the nanoparticles, U251 cells were exposed to a-FeOOH at the doses of 0, 3.75, 15, 60 and 120 microg/mL. The results showed that the alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles reduced the cell viability and induced necrosis and apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, nanoparticle exposure significantly increased the levels of superoxide anion and nitric oxide in a dose-dependent fashion in the cells. Our results suggest that exposure to alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles induce significant free radical formation and cytotoxic effects. The large surface area that induced high surface reactivity may play an important role in the cytotoxic effect of alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles.",cancer
"Preferential killing of cancer cells using silicon carbide quantum dots. Silicon carbide quantum dots are highly luminescent biocompatible nanoparticles whose properties might be of particular interest for biomedical applications. In this study we investigated Silicon Carbide Quantum Dots (3C-SiC QDs) cellular localisation and influence on viability and proliferation on oral squamous carcinoma (AT-84 and HSC) and immortalized cell lines (S-G). They clearly localize into the nuclei, but the presence of 3C-SiC QDs in culture medium provoke morphological changes in cultured cells. We demonstrate that 3C-SiC QDs display dose- and time-dependent selective cytotoxicity on cancer versus immortalized cells in vitro. Since one of the limitations of classical antineoplastic drugs is their lack of selectivity, these results open a new way in the search for antiproliferative drugs.",cancer
"Process for determining the cancer burden of the Hopi Tribe. The Hopi Tribe is located in the northeastern part of Arizona on more than one million acres of federally reserved land. Tribally based community research, conducted in collaboration with University of Arizona researchers, has been successfully implemented on Hopi beginning with a cross-sectional community survey in 1993 and continuing with a second survey in 2006. Both surveys identified a strong community interest in cancer. This article reports on the process involved in a third study, in which official Hopi enrollment data were matched with Arizona Cancer Registry data. The process involved bringing in a new partner and obtaining tribal, state, and university approvals, as well as a signed data exchange agreement between the state and the Hopi Tribe. Technical implementation of the data match required computer programming and epidemiologic expertise, as well as an understanding of the community and the culture. Close collaboration among Hopi residents and university epidemiologists was critical.",cancer
"Mediastinal teratoma mimicking massive pleural effusion. Immature mediastinal teratoma is very rare, found in only 1% of all mediastinal teratomas. Raised serum alpha feto-protein acts as important surrogate marker for both diagnosis and follow up in such cases. Surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy are keys in the management, especially in patients older than 15 years of age. We present a 14-year-boy presenting clinico-radiologically as left sided massive pleural effusion. Raised serum marker as well as excision biopsy of the mediastinal mass following thoracotomy were indicative of a diagnosis of immature teratoma.",cancer
"Calcium and magnesium in drinking water and risk of death from kidney cancer. The possible association between the risk of kidney cancer development and the levels of calcium and magnesium in drinking water from municipal supplies was investigated in a matched cancer case-control study in Taiwan. All eligible kidney cancer deaths (1778 cases) of Taiwan residents from 1999 through 2008 were compared with deaths from other causes (1778 controls), and the levels of calcium and magnesium in drinking water of these residents were determined. Data on calcium and magnesium levels in drinking water throughout Taiwan were obtained from the Taiwan Water Supply Corporation (TWSC). The control group consisted of individuals who died from other causes, and the controls were pair-matched to the cancer cases by gender, year of birth, and year of death. The adjusted odd ratios for death attributed to kidney cancer for individuals with higher calcium levels in their drinking water, as compared to the lowest tertile, were 0.89 (95% CI = 0.72-1.11) and 0.78 (95% CI = 0.62-0.98), respectively. The adjusted odd ratios were not statistically significant for the relationship between magnesium levels in drinking water and kidney cancer development. The results of the present study demonstrate that there may be a significant protective effect of calcium intake from drinking water against the risk of death due to kidney cancer.",cancer
"The use of osteo-articular allografts for reconstruction after resection of the distal radius for tumour. Several techniques have been described to reconstruct a mobile wrist joint after resection of the distal radius for tumour. We reviewed our experience of using an osteo-articular allograft to do this in 17 patients with a mean follow-up of 58.9 months (28 to 119). The mean range of movement at the wrist was 56 degrees flexion, 58 degrees extension, 84 degrees supination and 80 degrees pronation. The mean ISOLS-MSTS score was 86% (63% to 97%) and the mean patient-rated wrist evaluation score was 16.5 (3 to 34). There was no local recurrence or distant metastases. The procedure failed in one patient with a fracture of the graft and an arthrodesis was finally required. Union was achieved at the host-graft interface in all except two cases. No patient reported more than modest non-disabling pain and six reported no pain at all. Radiographs showed early degenerative changes at the radiocarpal joint in every patient. A functional pain-free wrist can be restored with an osteo-articular allograft after resection of the distal radius for bone tumour, thereby avoiding the donor site morbidity associated with an autograft. These results may deteriorate with time.",cancer
"Use of metal proximal radial endoprostheses for treatment of non-traumatic disorders: a case series.

Following surgery, all elbows were clinically stable and there was 100% survivorship of the prosthesis. Evaluation of function was assessed clinically and by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, achieving a mean of 86% (70 to 100). Results at medium-term follow-up are encouraging with regards to elbow stability, implant survivorship and functional outcome.",cancer
"Baseline characteristics of participants in the randomized national lung screening trial. BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a randomized study conducted at 33 US sites, is comparing lung cancer mortality among persons screened with reduced dose helical computerized tomography and among persons screened with chest radiograph. In this article, we present characteristics of the study population. METHODS: Eligible participants were aged 55-74 years and were current or former smokers with a cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack-years. Randomization was stratified by site, sex, and age. To assess representativeness of the study population, demographic characteristics of individuals from the general population who met NLST age and smoking history inclusion criteria were obtained from the Tobacco Use Supplement of the US Census Bureau Current Population Surveys. RESULTS: The NLST enrolled 53 456 persons, with 26 733 randomly assigned to chest radiograph screening and 26 723 to computerized tomography screening. Characteristics of the participants were as follows: 31 533 (59%) were men, 39 234 (73%) were younger than 65 years, 25 779 (48%) were current smokers, and 16 839 (32%) had a college or higher degree. Median cigarette exposure was 48 pack-years. Among Tobacco Use Supplement respondents who met NLST age and smoking history criteria, 59% were men, 65% were younger than 65 years, and 57% were current smokers. Median cigarette exposure among this group was 47 pack-years, and 14% had a college degree or higher. CONCLUSION: The NLST cohort has a distribution of sex and pack-year history that is similar to the component of the general US population that meets the major NLST eligibility criteria; however, NLST participants are younger, better educated, and less likely to be current smokers.",cancer
"Multiple myeloma precursor disease. Recent data indicate that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by the precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma. Currently, multiple myeloma is a clinical diagnosis based on manifestations including hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions, whereas MGUS and smoldering myeloma are diagnosed based on laboratory abnormalities. Current clinical markers allow for more individualized risk stratification and counseling of these patients. However, there is a dearth of biomarkers and molecular imaging techniques capable of (1) accurately identifying patients with disease biology corresponding with high risk of progression; (2) elucidating the mechanism of transformation to multiple myeloma; and (3) forming a framework for development of targeted therapies. This case presentation and review discusses the current understanding of myeloma precursor disease and future opportunities for improving personalized management of patients with MGUS or smoldering myeloma, as well as the potential for developing early treatment strategies designed to delay and prevent development of multiple myeloma.",cancer
"Active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer: a decision analysis. CONTEXT: In the United States, 192,000 men were diagnosed as having prostate cancer in 2009, the majority with low-risk, clinically localized disease. Treatment of these cancers is associated with substantial morbidity. Active surveillance is an alternative to initial treatment, but long-term outcomes and effect on quality of life have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To examine the quality-of-life benefits and risks of active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: Decision analysis using a simulation model was performed: men were treated at diagnosis with brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or radical prostatectomy or followed up by active surveillance (a strategy of close monitoring of newly diagnosed patients with serial prostate-specific antigen measurements, digital rectal examinations, and biopsies, with treatment at disease progression or patient choice). Probabilities and utilities were derived from previous studies and literature review. In the base case, the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was assumed to be 0.83. Men incurred short- and long-term adverse effects of treatment. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohorts of 65-year-old men newly diagnosed as having clinically localized, low-risk prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen level <10 ng/mL, stage </=T2a disease, and Gleason score </=6). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). RESULTS: Active surveillance was associated with the greatest QALE (11.07 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), followed by brachytherapy (10.57 QALYs), IMRT (10.51 QALYs), and radical prostatectomy (10.23 QALYs). Active surveillance remained associated with the highest QALE even if the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was as low as 0.6. However, the QALE gains and the optimal strategy were highly dependent on individual preferences for living under active surveillance and for having been treated. CONCLUSIONS: Under a wide range of assumptions, for a 65-year-old man, active surveillance is a reasonable approach to low-risk prostate cancer based on QALE compared with initial treatment. However, individual preferences play a central role in the decision whether to treat or to pursue active surveillance.",cancer
"Ovarian small cell carcinoma, hypercalcemic type exhibiting a response to high-dose chemotherapy. A gravida 2, para 2 25-year-old woman three months post-partum presented to her primary physician with abdominal pain and bloating; a 20-cm complex cystic pelvic mass was identified by ultrasound. No ovarian masses were noted during ultrasound exam at the prior pregnancy, less than one year earlier. Her labs included hypercalcemia (11.8 mg/dL, normal less than 10.5) and an elevated CA 125 (160 U/mL, normal less than 35). An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 20-cm right ovarian mass. Frozen section was performed and a sex cord-stromal tumor was favored. Permanent sections of the specimen, however, revealed round, closely packed neoplastic cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasm ratio and high mitotic rate growing in a diffuse pattern with scattered follicle-like, ill-defined microcystic spaces. Immunohistochemical stains revealed the neoplasm to be focally positive for keratin and negative for inhibin. The final diagnosis rendered was small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type. Further staging revealed para-aortic lymph node involvement (stage IIIC). Current literature suggests a very poor prognosis for these neoplasms despite aggressive therapy, with an overall survival rate of 10 percent. Rare response has been noted, however, with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Our patient underwent a rigorous chemotherapeutic regimen followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant, and as of August 2010, (17 months after initial diagnosis), the patient has had no recurrence.",cancer
"Differences in attributions of mental illness and social distance for portrayals of four mental disorders. For individuals with mental illness, others' perceptions of mental illness often limit integration into communities. Perceptions of mental illness manifest as social stigma in the form of social distance and may depend on individuals' attributions of the origins of mental illness. 180 university students completed a survey on attribution of mental illness and social distance across several disorders (psychiatric and physical). Participants indicated greater social distance for severe mental illness (i.e., schizophrenia) than less severe mental illness and physical illness. More desire for social distance may be related to unfamiliarity with severe mental illness rather than less severe mental and physical illnesses. Greater understanding of how individuals perceive mental illness can inform efforts to educate the public.",cancer

Granulomatous mycosis fungoides with large cell transformation misdiagnosed as leprosy. BACKGROUND: Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is an unusual histopathological variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma without clinical distinction from classic mycosis fungoides. Symptoms associated with peripheral nerve involvement have rarely been reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: The authors described a case of granulomatous MF stage IIB with large cell transformation who initially presented with leprosy-like condition and chronic left peroneal neuropathy The patient received six courses ofgemcitabine with greater than 90% improvement of skin lesions. The rest of the lesions were successfully treated with local electron beam radiation. CONCLUSION: Granulomatous MF with neuropathy can be clinically misdiagnosed if there is no histopathological and immunohistochemical finding to support the diagnosis of lymphoma.,cancer
"Double check up of malignancy biopsy specimens for patient safety. BACKGROUND: The diagnostic of malignancy in biopsy specimens is very important because it guides to selected treatment option and prognostic prediction. However biopsy specimens usually have small pieces leading to variations of the interpretation by anatomical pathologists. OBJECTIVE: To detect and correct the errors or the significant discrepancies in the diagnosis of biopsy specimens before sign-out and to determine the frequency of anatomic pathology significant discrepancies. DESIGN: The application of the mutually agreed work instructions (record) for the detection of errors or the significant discrepancies and their process of sign-out. The record of biopsy specimen that received a secondary check (1959 cases, 2005-2007) was analyzed. RESULTS: After a secondary check, 53 cases of non-malignancy for any reason by a second pathologist were included. However when using our definition on significant discrepancies, only 37 cases were considered. Another seven cases with the opinions with malignancy that were of different cell types that do harm to the patients were added. Therefore, 44 cases (2.25%) had truly significant discrepancies. CONCLUSION: The truly significant discrepancy frequency was 2.25% during the process of pre-sign-out secondary check of malignancy of biopsy specimens. The project has been applied as a routine daily work. It can be an innovative safety program for patient in Thailand.",cancer
"Results of multidisciplinary therapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa at Srinagarind Hospital, Thailand. OBJECTIVE: Review the clinical presentation and treatment of buccal carcinoma and compare it to the results of treatment as per survival rate. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors reviewed the medical records of newly diagnosed seen between 1995 and 2005 at the Division of Plastic Surgery and the Department of Radiotherapy, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University Patients previously treated elsewhere or those whose lesions secondarily involved the buccal mucosa were excluded. RESULTS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 107 buccal carcinoma patients (94 females and 13 males) averaging 67 years of age. The 5-year survival rates of patients with Stage I (5.6%), 11 (6.5%), III (12.1%), and IVa (75.7%) were 67%, 43%, 47%, and 26%, respectively. A combined modality treatment (surgery and radiation or chemotherapy) was used to treat the advanced stage (III and IV) patients. The rate of incomplete therapy was high (47.78%). In the group that completed the protocol (i.e., neoadjuvant, surgery, and post operative radiation), there were five patients for whom the 5-year survival seemed higher than the patients who followed the standard treatment of surgery and post-operative radiation but it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The treatment of buccal carcinoma requires a multidisciplinary team approach because most of the patients are elderly and present with an advanced stage. If treatment continues through to completion of the protocol, the survival rate would increase.",cancer
"Radical esophagectomy for esophageal cancer: results in Thai patients. BACKGROUND: Radical esophagectomy was reported to have prolonged survival in patients with esophageal cancer However, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Controversy still exists regarding value of radical esophagectomy MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors analyzed the results, including complications and survival in 68 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who were treated with transthoracic radical esophagectomy at the Department of Surgery, Siriraj hospital, Mahidol University between June 2002 and June 2008. RESULTS: There were 57 males and eight females with a mean age of 59.28 +/- 11.25 years. Regarding T staging, 81.5% of the patients were in T3 stage while 1.5% of the patients had Ti stage, 15.4% had T2 stage, and 1.5% had T4 stage. Lymph node metastasis (NI) was found in 63.1% of the patients and NO was in 36.9%. Most of the patients were in advanced stages with 53.8% in stage III, 44.6% in stage II, and 1.5% in stage I. The 5-year survival rate of the patients with node positive was significantly lower than the patients with node negative (p = 0.018). The survival was significantly better in stage Ilcompared to stage III (p = 0.012). Overall 5-year survival rate was 28. 5%. Most common complications were from pulmonary causes (22.1%), anastomotic leakage (8.8%), and wound infection (8.8%). Mortality rate was 4.41%. CONCLUSION: Radical esophagectomy was associated with relatively low mortality and acceptable survival. It should be considered in surgical treatment of patients with esophageal cancer",cancer
"Obstructive uropathy following radiation therapy in carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Eighty-three cases of carcinoma of the cervix presenting over a 5-year period, 1997 to 2001 were considered for evaluation of the effects of Irradiation on the urinary tract. Ultrasound scans were used to detect ureteric obstructions in the follow-up period. Significant progressive ureteric obstruction occurred in 6 patients (7.2%), all of whom had malignant strictures. The diagnoses of these strictures were made between 8 months and five years after the Initial treatment. Patients having malignant stricture tend to be in a higher original stage of tumour. The lower ureter was the site of ureteric obstruction in 4 patients while 2 had lesions in middle ureter. The latency period between primary treatment of the tumour and diagnosis of uropathy is significantly shorter for malignant strictures. The site of occurrence of the strictures had no discernible significance but the absence of a bilateral obstruction in spite of all of them being malignant lesions is in disagreement with the published data.",cancer
Co-existing tubercular axillary lymphadenitis with carcinoma breast can falsely over-stage the disease--case series. The synchronous occurrence of tuberculosis and carcinoma in breast is unusual. The simultaneous occurrence of both the diseases can complicate the neoplastic disease. The diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in a patient with cancer assumes importance as it can prevent high mortality in patients with co-existent disease and thereby create problems in treatment decision. Axillary lymph node enlargement in breast cancer patient is not always caused by metastatic tumour of the breast even in the ipsilateral axillary nodes. We present here six case reports as an example of tuberculous axillary lymphadenitis co-existing with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Accurate diagnosis has helped in down-staging carcinoma of the breast and also in identifying curable disease.,cancer
"Alpha-fetoprotein secretion in a craniopharyngioma. Are craniopharyngiomas part of the germ cell tumor family? A 14-months-old girl was admitted to our hospital because of excessive irritability and abnormal eye movements over the last two months. Brain CT and MRI revealed a suprasellar cystic and partially solid mass with calcifications. The laboratory investigation revealed increased serum levels of AFP. These findings were suggestive for a brain germ cell tumor. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy was started. After two courses there was a reduction in the levels of AFP but the tumor size remained unchanged. Subtotal tumor excision was performed that revealed the presence of a craniopharyngioma. One month later there was enlargement of the cystic part of the tumor, while serum AFP was elevated. The child received again systemic chemotherapy and placement of a reservoir into the cystic part of the tumor. Analysis of the intracystic flouid revealed the presence of beta-HCG and AFP. Following that the patient received brachytherapy with intracavity yttrium placement. Three months later repeated MRI showed a decrease in the size of the cystic part, while the solid part remained unchanged. Thus, the solid part was treated by radiosurgery. One year later the patient was stable but with complete loss of vision. These observations support the theory of a germ cell tumor family, in which craniopharyngioma and germ cell tumor present the two sides of the same entity, while between them a wide variety of tumors, with variable type of secretion of AFP and/or beta-HCG, may exist.",cancer
"Comparison of BD Surepath and ThinPrep Pap systems in the processing of mucus-rich specimens. BACKGROUND: Excessive mucus, as well as blood and inflammation, can be problematic in the processing and screening of liquid-based cervical Pap preparations by interfering in the process of cell retrieval onto specimen filters or slides. This study compares the capacity of the BD SurePath and ThinPrep liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) tests to handle mucus-laden specimens. METHODS: A 100 muL volume of pooled cervical epithelial cells was added to BD SurePath and ThinPrep liquid Pap test vials. Aliquots of cervical mucus that had been collected and pooled from previously processed mucus-rich Pap specimens were added to each series of test vials in amounts of 250 muL, 500 muL, 1000 muL, and 2000 muL. The vials were then routinely processed on their respective instruments and the test slides evaluated for cellularity of the squamous cell component. RESULTS: The BD SurePath test specimens showed no reduction of the squamous cell component resulting from the addition of any of the aliquots of mucus. The ThinPrep test specimens showed a marked loss of cellularity upon the addition of the first aliquot of mucus, with large areas of the filters showing nearly complete absence of squamous cells. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive mucus remains a potentially limiting factor in the ThinPrep Pap system. This appears to be the result of direct obstruction of the filtration membrane causing a markedly diminished retrieval of squamous epithelial cells and potentially impacting disease detection. The BD SurePath system, conversely, manages mucus by a cell enrichment process, which results in undiminished cell recovery as observed in this study's test conditions.",cancer
"Antitumor effects and anticancer applications of bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are firmly entrenched in the treatment of metastatic bone disease secondary to several tumor types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and myeloma. More recently, an emerging body of preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that bisphosphonates might also exhibit antitumor activity. This expanded role for bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting might have profound clinical implications in many cancer types, particularly in the context of prevention of bone metastasis. Increased understanding of the mechanistic basis of the antitumor effects indicates that these might occur via direct mechanisms such as induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasion, as well as indirect mechanisms such as inhibition of angiogenesis. There is also considerable evidence to suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates might exert additive or synergistic interactions with standard cytotoxic agents. However, mature clinical data with bisphosphonates are limited and, thus far, provide conflicting evidence regarding the antitumor role of bisphosphonates, but have mostly been conducted with first-generation bisphosphonates such as clodronate that are not as effective as next-generation bisphosphonates. Several large randomized clinical trials are ongoing with the next-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid to prospectively confirm an antitumor role for bisphosphonates in various tumor types. This review assesses the current body of preclinical and clinical evidence in favor of an antitumor effect of bisphosphonates in different cancer types.",cancer
"Examining the metastatic niche: targeting the microenvironment. Some of the most common cancer types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, show a predilection to metastasize to bone. The molecular basis of this preferential growth of cancer cells in the bone microenvironment has been an area of active investigation. Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain to be elucidated, it is now increasingly being recognized that the unique characteristics of the bone niche provide homing signals to cancer cells, and create a microenvironment conducive for the cancer cells to colonize. Concomitantly, cancer cells release several regulatory factors that result in abnormal bone destruction and/or formation. This complex bidirectional interplay between tumor cells and bone microenvironment establishes a ""vicious cycle"" that leads to a selective growth advantage for the cancer cells. The molecular insights gained on the underpinnings of bone metastasis in recent years have also provided us with avenues to devise innovative approaches for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this review is to describe our current understanding of molecular pathophysiology of cancer metastases to bone, as well as its therapeutic implications.",cancer
"Implications of bone metastases and the benefits of bone-targeted therapy. Several cancers, including those originating in the breast, prostate, and lung, exhibit a propensity to metastasize to bone, resulting in debilitating skeletal complications. These sequelae, such as intractable pain, pathologic fractures, spinal compression, and hypercalcemia, greatly erode the patients' quality of life. Bisphosphonates, a class of antiresorptive drugs, are now the mainstay of the treatment of skeletal-related events in myeloma bone disease and many solid cancers with bone metastases. Current evidence indicates that newer-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. In addition, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of bone metastasis has resulted in the development of several bone-targeted therapies including a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB ligand (RANKL). In this review, clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of currently available bone-targeted therapies including bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody in the treatment of bone metastasis due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma bone disease will be summarized.",cancer

"Diagnostic dilemmas of infantile sarcoma of the forearm. The authors present an interesting case of a suckling baby treated for forearm tumour. All the preoperative examinations including the imaging methods are documented, as are the surgical procedures and the final results. The case report is interesting not only because such surgery is infrequent but also due to the unpredictable progress of the final diagnosis statement. Before surgery the tumour was diagnosed as an organising haematoma; based on clinical and radiological signs the diagnosis subsequently rose to rapidly growing haemangioma or vascular malformation causing arm paresis and vascular supply disorder. The diagnosis was changed to angiolipoma during surgery. The final histopathological statement was: infantile fibrosarcoma. Despite the virtue of imaging methods and meticulous clinical examination, the surgical and histopathological findings are not necessarily absolutely identical. Having presented this particular case the authors would like to share their experience.",cancer
"Nasal dermoids without intracranial extension in teenagers. BACKGROUND: Nasal dermoid cysts are benign, cystic midline masses. They contain mature tissues and often pocket hair, fat or sebum. Patients usually present with nasal enlargement or with a wide nasal dorsum with or without a fistula, causing an unacceptable cosmetic appearance. OBJECTIVE: To define a reliable surgical approach and method of removing dermoid with no intracranial extension in adolescent age. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively present diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in three teenagers ages 15, 17 and 18. All patients underwent prior surgeries at different hospitals. In the first case, the incision and exstirpation of the fistula's opening, followed by the fistula's canal, was performed. In the other two patients, the nasal dermoids were removed via the open approach with the transcollumelar incision. In all patients, we performed rhinoplasty with osteotomies to achieve an improved cosmetic effect. The esthetic results are presented. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of nasal swelling requires imaging. Total excision of the cyst is considered the casual treatment. The open rhinoplasty is an adequate method in patients with nasal dermoids without an intracranial extension. Experienced surgeons should manage the functional and esthetical aspects together during the same surgery.",cancer
"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) among children with cancer in South Africa. BACKGROUND IN ADULTS,: HIV increases the risk of certain cancers known, or thought, to have an underlying infectious etiology; the impact on the risk of cancer in children is less clear. METHODS: Here, we report results of an on-going study at four pediatric oncology centers in South Africa in which children diagnosed with cancer are tested routinely for HIV. Odds ratios (OR) for the prevalence of various malignancies were calculated (with adjustment for age, sex, and center) for the children infected with HIV using all children with cancer and non-malignant conditions, but not infected with HIV, as a comparison group. RESULTS: Of 882 children with cancer, 38 were HIV infected (for 12 the HIV status was unknown). HIV was associated with Kaposi sarcoma (all 10 cases were HIV infected; P < 0.001) and with Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 46.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.4-130.3; 13/33). For non-Burkitt non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 2/39 were HIV infected (OR = 5.0, 95% CI 0.9-27.0). No other cancer type was significantly associated with HIV, including lymphoid leukemias (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.04-2.9; 1/172). CONCLUSIONS: Only Kaposi sarcoma and Burkitt lymphoma were significantly associated with HIV infection although results for non-Burkitt NHL were suggestive. Notably, we did not identify an association between infection with HIV and lymphoid leukemias, for which an underlying infectious etiology has been suggested.",cancer
"Metastatic tumors in the pancreas in the modern era. BACKGROUND: Tumors metastasizing to the pancreas are rare, and published series are limited by few patients treated for extended periods of time. Renal cell cancer (RCC) is the most common primary tumor metastasizing to the pancreas. Our aim was to describe the clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcomes in a modern series of patients who underwent metastasectomy, with an emphasis on RCC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of all pancreatic resections between January 1993 and October 2009. RESULTS: We identified 40 patients with a median age of 62 years; 55% were female. Patients most commonly presented with abdominal pain (47.5%). Operations performed included 10 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 1 middle, 23 distal, 3 total pancreatectomies, and 3 enucleations. Primary cancers were RCC (n = 20), ovarian (n = 6), sarcoma (n = 3), colon (n = 3), melanoma (n = 2), and others (n = 6). Median survival for all patients after metastasectomy was 4.4 years. Median survival after metastasectomy for RCC was 8.7 years, and the 5-year actuarial survival was 61%. For RCCs, pancreas was the first site of an extrarenal recurrence in 85% and was synchronous with the primary in 5% of patients. There was no survival difference if the time interval to metastasis was shorter than the median (8.7 years), if tumor nodules were multiple or bigger than the median (3 cm), or if the pancreas was not the first site of metastases. CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive approach to lesions metastatic to the pancreas is often warranted if the patient can be rendered free of disease. Although patients with RCC can experience long-term survival after metastasectomy, survival is less favorable for other primary tumors.",cancer
"Therapeutic options in patients with early T stage and advanced N stage of tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas. OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic role of surgery followed by radiotherapy (OPRT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with early T (T1/T2) and advanced N (N2/N3) stage tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING: A tertiary hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 42 patients who met the eligible criteria (24 patients were treated by OPRT, 18 patients by CCRT) were reviewed. RESULTS: Mean overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 49.0 months and 43.0 months in OPRT group, respectively, and 39.6 months and 35.0 months in CCRT group, respectively (P = 0.18 for OS, P = 0.29 for DFS between the two groups). There was also no significant difference in survival estimates between OPRT and CCRT group in terms of two-year OS (P = 0.18) and two-year DFS (P = 0.45). In the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, the scores for global health status and symptom scales did not differ between the two groups. However, the OPRT group reported better functional scales and significantly higher scores for cognitive (P = 0.008) and social function (P = 0.03). Among single items, a significantly lower score for insomnia (P = 0.007) was noted in the OPRT group. In EORTC QLQ-H&N35 modules, there were no significantly different scales between the two groups except scores for nutritional supplements, in which the OPRT group presented lower symptom scores (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: OPRT could be still a viable option for managing selected cases of advanced oropharyngeal cancer because one can expect comparable therapeutic outcome as well as quality of life.",cancer
"Spanish validation of the University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire for head and neck cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: The University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire is one of the most widely used instruments to evaluate the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients. The aim of this study was to perform a Spanish translation and validation of the UW-QOL questionnaire. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Three tertiary-care hospitals and a laryngectomee rehabilitation center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire were performed following accepted international guidelines. The psychometric validation was performed on a consecutive series of patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract with no signs of relapse, recruited from May 2007 to December 2008. Eligible subjects were invited to complete the Spanish version of the UW-QOL questionnaire during routine clinical consultation, and complete it again within 15 days. Subjects also completed a validated Spanish version of the Goldberg Mental Health Survey and were evaluated by the use of the Karnofsky Index. RESULTS: A Spanish version of the questionnaire was developed in iterative fashion. In the psychometric validation process, a total of 76 patients were analyzed. Reliability was excellent, including both internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.84) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient between 0.91 and 0.97 with a confidence interval of 95%). Construct validity was supported by statistically significant relationships between the Karnofsky Index, the Goldberg Mental Health Survey, and the translated UW-QOL questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The Spanish version of the UW-QOL questionnaire appears to be culturally appropriate and psychometrically valid.",cancer
"Correlation of biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters, including choline/creatine ratio (Cho/Cr) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with protein expression of 10 common tumor and prognostic markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: University hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Cho/Cr and ADC obtained from 74 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were correlated with the expression level of the 10 protein markers as determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Cho/Cr showed significant positive correlations with cyclooxygenase 2 in primary tumors (r = 0.714), and epidermal growth factor receptor in metastatic cervical lymph nodes (r = 0.522). ADC showed significant (r = -0.591) negative correlation with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in metastatic cervical lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: There are relationships between protein and functional MRI markers. Future research in this direction may improve our understanding of the cancer micro-environment.",cancer
"Children with acute leukemia: a comparison of outcomes from allogeneic blood stem cell and bone marrow transplantation. BACKGROUND: The relative merits of peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) versus bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for children with standard and high-risk hematologic malignancies remain unclear. In a retrospective study, we compared allogeneic PBSCT (n = 30) with BMT (n = 110) in children with acute leukemia between January 2001 and September 2006. PROCEDURE: Median age for PBSCT was 9 years versus 8 years for BMT. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and medical variables. The unadjusted probabilities of disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The association of graft-source and time to each of the study endpoints was estimated by Cox's regression model and the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was included as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: Time to neutrophil engraftment and platelet independence was faster after PBSCT than BMT (neutrophils 15.0 days vs. 17.0 days, P < 0.001; platelets, 21.0 days vs. 27.0 days, P = 0.034). The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GvHD at 100 days was 10.4% (SE 5.6%) after PBSCT and 15.1% (SE 3.5%) after BMT (P = NS). The cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD was 13.8% (SE 6.3%) after PBSCT and 11.3% (SE 3.1%) after BMT (P = NS). One-year disease-free survival was 37.9% (SE 9.0%) for PBSCT recipients versus 65.1% (SE 4.6%) after BMT (P = 0.005) but this difference was not sustained in multivariate analysis. Thus, only disease risk and pre-transplant CMV seropositivity were significant predictors of disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PBSCT for children produces faster engraftment without increased risk of acute or chronic GvHD.",cancer
"Retrospective analysis of pediatric cancer patients diagnosed with the pandemic H1N1 influenza infection. BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on disease characteristics and outcome of children with cancer who contracted the H1N1 influenza infection during the 2009 pandemic. METHODS: All 76 pediatric patients with cancer and documented H1N1 infection who presented to the Pediatric Department at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) between October 1 and December 1, 2009 were reviewed for clinical characteristics and course of the disease. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients had hematological malignancies and half were receiving non-intensive chemotherapy at the time of infection. With the exception of two patients who needed pediatric intensive care unit admission, the course of the remaining patients was uneventful whether they were hospitalized or not. No deaths related to H1N1 influenza infection were reported. Sixty-three percent of patients became afebrile within 48 hr of receiving oseltamivir. One-third of hospitalized patients were discharged in < 3 days. CONCLUSION: The course of H1N1 influenza infection in children with cancer appears to be mild in most cases.",cancer
"Delay and causes of delay in the diagnosis of childhood cancer in Africa. BACKGROUND: Although a few studies have investigated delays in diagnosis and treatment among children and adolescents with cancer, this has never been subject of study in South Africa. Early diagnosis is fundamental as it allows timely treatment and prevents unnecessary complications. PROCEDURES: Combined prospective and retrospective study of 194 children with cancer at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, diagnosed between 2000 and 2009: 126 patients were included through review of the medical charts and 68 through interviews with the parents. RESULTS: The median total diagnosis delay was 34 days (2-1,826). The median patient delay was 5 days (0-457). The median physician delay was 20 days (0-924). Gender, age or ethnicity of the children, as well as parental level of education did not have a significant influence on the total time to diagnosis. Initial misdiagnoses were frequent (58%). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable delay in diagnosing childhood cancer in the area served by Tygerberg Hospital, due mostly to a physician delay of 20 days on average. The findings of our unit should be correlated with other South African centers. There is a clear need to increase parental awareness of childhood cancer and to intensify the education of nurses and doctors with regard to the warning signs of the disease.",cancer
"Incidence of childhood central nervous system tumors in the Nordic countries. BACKGROUND: The incidence rates of childhood central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. Large geographical and temporal variations in the incidence rates of CNS tumors have been reported. Increasing incidence rates would be a public health concern, as they might indicate increased exposure to environmental risk factors. METHODS: All 3,983 children 0-14 years of age registered with a primary CNS tumor in 1985-2006 in the national cancer registries of the Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden were identified. Tumors were classified according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer version 3 (ICCC-3). Join-point analysis was used to detect changes in trends and to estimate annual changes in incidence rates. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence rate of CNS tumors was 42 per million. No statistically significant change in time trends of incidence rates was observed during 1985-2006. Furthermore, the incidence by birth cohort was relatively stable during the study period. CONCLUSION: The incidence rates of childhood CNS tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. The stable incidence rates during the last 22 years indicate that major changes in environmental risk factors are unlikely.",cancer
"Childhood leukemia incidence in Brazil according to different geographical regions. BACKGROUND: Resource-rich countries tend to have a higher incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas lower rates are seen in more deprived countries. This study describes the incidence of childhood acute leukemia in Brazil, an upper middle-income country, based on data from 16 population-based cancer registries (PBCRs). PROCEDURE: Data were examined from 16 PBCRs in Brazilian cities located in five geographical regions during the period from 1997 to 2004. Incidence rates were analyzed according to gender, age, and type of leukemia. The Wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate for gender-age based difference between by leukemia type. RESULTS: The median age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of leukemia in children aged 0-14 years old was 53.3 per million. A different AAIR was found regarding ALL and myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) that ranged from 24.8 to 76.84 per 1,000,000 children. Manaus, although located in a poor area of Brazil, exhibited the highest AAIR (56.6 per million) of ALL. Goiania had the highest AAIR (24.5 per million) of MPD. The median age-specific incidence rate (ASIR) for the 16 Brazilian PBCRs demonstrated a marked peak in incidence of ALL at age 3 years old, in both genders. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study of childhood leukemia demonstrates that substantial regional differences exist regarding the incidence of acute leukemia in Brazil, which warrants further ecological study.",cancer
"Incidence, survival, and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors versus neuroblastoma in children and young adults: nine standard SEER registries, 1975-2006. BACKGROUND: The incidence, survival, and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in children were determined as a first step in improving diagnosis and therapy. Outcomes were compared with neuroblastoma, a pediatric malignancy that shares several biomarkers. METHODS: Incidence rates, observed survival rates and 31-year limited duration prevalence counts were obtained from SEER*Stat for diagnosis years 1975 to 2006. These rates were compared between and within NETs and neuroblastoma for demographic and tumor-related variables from nine standard SEER registries for ages 0-29 years. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify prognostic factors for survival in NETs. RESULTS: The number of NETs was 1,073 compared to 1,664 neuroblastomas. The most common NET sites were lung, breast, and appendix. NET 5-year observed survival rates increased from 83% between 1975 and 1979 to 84% for the 2000-2006 period, while analogous neuroblastoma survival rates steadily increased from 45-73%. Five-year observed survival was less than 30% in females with NETs of the cervix and ovary. The estimated 31-year limited duration prevalence for NETs as of January 1, 2006 in the U.S. population was 7,724 compared to 9,960 for neuroblastomas. Age-adjusted multivariate Cox Regression demonstrated small cell histology, primary location in the breast, and distant stage as major predictors of decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS: While survivorship has significantly increased for neuroblastoma, those diagnosed with NETs have shown no increase in survival during this 31-year period. NETs constitute an unrecognized cancer threat to children and young adults comparable to neuroblastoma in both number of affected persons and disease severity.",cancer
"A phase II study of metronomic oral topotecan for recurrent childhood brain tumors. BACKGROUND: The prognosis for recurrent or refractory brain tumors in children is poor with conventional therapies. Topotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor with good central nervous system (CNS) penetration following oral administration. Increased efficacy of topotecan has been demonstrated with prolonged low-dose daily treatment in pre-clinical models. To investigate further this drug delivered orally in pediatric CNS malignancies, a phase II study in children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors was performed. PROCEDURE: Patients </= 21 years of age at diagnosis with a recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary CNS malignancy and measurable disease, were eligible. Patients enrolled into four strata: ependymoma (N = 4), high-grade glioma (HGG) (N = 6), brainstem glioma (BSG) (N = 13), and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) (N = 8). Oral topotecan was administered once daily at a dose of 0.8 mg/m(2)/day for 21 consecutive days repeated every 28 days. Response and toxicity profiles were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were evaluable (median age 9.2 years; 10 males). Two objective responses were observed in PNET patients with disseminated tumor at study entry. These two patients remain alive and in remission 7 and 9.5 years off study. Four other patients (two BSG, one PNET, and one HGG) had stable disease (median 4.6 months). The most common toxicities were hematologic. CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral topotecan at a dose of 0.8 mg/m(2)/day can be safely administered to children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors. This regimen identified activity in recurrent PNET. The prolonged progression free survival (PFS) in two PNET patients justifies consideration of this regimen in more advanced clinical trials.",cancer
"Spectrum of SMARCB1/INI1 mutations in familial and sporadic rhabdoid tumors. BACKGROUND: Germline mutations and deletions of SMARCB1/INI1 in chromosome band 22q11.2 predispose patients to rhabdoid tumor and schwannomatosis. Previous estimates suggested that 15-20% of rhabdoid tumors were caused by an underlying germline abnormality of SMARCB1. However, these studies were limited by case selection and an inability to detect intragenic deletions and duplications. PROCEDURE: One hundred matched tumor and blood samples from patients with rhabdoid tumors of the brain, kidney, or soft tissues were analyzed for mutations and deletions of SMARCB1 by FISH, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), sequence analysis and high resolution Illumina 610K SNP-based oligonucleotide array studies. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 100 patients were found to have a germline SMARCB1 abnormality. These abnormalities included point and frameshift mutations, intragenic deletions and duplications, and larger deletions including regions both proximal and distal to SMARCB1. There were nine cases that demonstrated parent to child transmission of a mutated copy of SMARCB1. In eight of the nine cases, one or more family members were also diagnosed with rhabdoid tumor or schwannoma, and two of the eight families presented with multiple affected children in a manner consistent with gonadal mosaicism. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of newly diagnosed patients with rhabdoid tumor have an underlying genetic predisposition to tumors due to a germline SMARCB1 alteration. Families may demonstrate incomplete penetrance and gonadal mosaicism, which must be considered when counseling families of patients with rhabdoid tumor.",cancer
"Masitinib for the treatment of systemic and cutaneous mastocytosis with handicap: a phase 2a study. Treatment options for patients suffering from indolent forms of mastocytosis remain inadequate with the hyperactivation of mast cells responsible for many of the disease's systemic manifestations. Masitinib is a potent and highly selective oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A combined inhibition of c-Kit and Lyn make it particularly efficient in controlling the activity of mast cells and therefore, of potential therapeutic benefit in mastocytosis. Masitinib was administered to 25 patients diagnosed as having systemic or cutaneous mastocytosis with related handicap (i.e., disabilities associated with flushes, depression, pruritus and quality-of-life) at the initial dose levels of 3 or 6 mg/kg/day over 12 weeks. In accordance with the AFIRMM study, response was based upon change of clinical symptoms associated with patient handicap at week 12 relative to baseline, regardless of disease subtype. Improvement was observed in all primary endpoints at week 12 including a reduction of flushes, Hamilton rating, and pruritus as compared with baseline by 64% (P = 0.0005), 43% (P = 0.0049), and 36% (P = 0.0077), respectively. An overall clinical response was observed in 14/25 patients (56%; [95%CI = 37%-75%]), with sustainable improvement observed throughout an extension phase (>60 weeks). Common adverse events were edema (44%), nausea (44%), muscle spasms (28%), and rash (28%), the majority of which were of mild or moderate severity with a significant decline in frequency observed after 12 weeks of treatment. One patient experienced a serious adverse event of reversible agranulocytosis. Masitinib is a promising treatment for indolent forms of mastocytosis with handicap and indicates acceptable tolerability for long-term treatment regimens.",cancer
"A comparison of radiotherapy with radiotherapy plus surgery for brain metastases from urinary bladder cancer: analysis of 62 patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 62 patients received either RT (n = 49), including whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or surgery (OP) combined with WBRT (n = 13). Overall survival (OS), intracerebral control (ICC) and local control (LC) were retrospectively analyzed. Six potential prognostic factors were assessed: age, gender, number of brain metastases, extracerebral metastases, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and interval from tumor diagnosis to RT. RESULTS: Median OS and ICC for the entire cohort were 9 and 7 months. No significant difference between RT and OP + RT was found for OS (p = 0.696) and ICC (p = 0.996). On multivariate analysis, improved OS was associated with lack of extracerebral metastases (p < 0.001) and RPA class (p < 0.001), and ICC with the latter (p < 0.001). SRS-incorporating RT resulted in 1-, 2-, and 3-year LC probability of 78%, 66%, and 51%. No association between LC and any of the potential prognostic factors was observed. The results of the subgroup RPA class analyses were similar to the entire cohort. CONCLUSION: Patient outcome for the RT-alone arm was not significantly different from OP + RT. SRS-incorporating treatment offers excellent LC rates. RPA class and the presence of extracerebral metastases demonstrated a significant prognostic role for survival. The latter should be used as stratification factors in randomized trials and can help define the cohort of patients that may benefit from more aggressive therapies.",cancer
"Radiofrequency ablation for benign aldosterone-producing adenoma: a scarless technique to an old disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating primary aldosteronism (PA) due to aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation is an established technique for treating malignant solid organ neoplasm. Its application on benign functional adrenal adenoma has never been prospectively described. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a patient cohort with computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous RFA performed on functional APA of size 4 cm or less. Treatment success was defined as complete tumor ablation on follow-up CT scan plus normalization of serum aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) at 3 to 6 months after RFA. Salvage laparoscopic adrenalectomy was offered to patients who had failed RFA and remained hypertensive. RESULTS: Between August 2004 and August 2008, 28 patients were referred for the procedure. Radiofrequency ablation was not performed on 4 APA because of their close proximity to major vascular structures. Twenty-four patients (11 men and 13 women) with a median age of 51.5 (range = 34-63) years underwent RFA for 11 right and 13 left APA. The median tumor diameter was 16.0 (range = 4.0-25.0) mm. There was no periprocedure hypertensive crisis or major morbidity or mortality. Minor complications occurred in 4 patients (16.7%), including 1 small pneumothorax and 3 retroperitoneal hematomas (< 3 cm), which all resolved on conservative treatment. At 3 to 6 months of follow-up, CT scan showed complete tumor ablation in all patients (100%). Primary aldosteronism was biochemically resolved in 23 patients (95.8%). Salvage adrenalectomy was not performed in the single failed patient, as she remained normotensive on repeated follow-up. The overall success rate of RFA was 95.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography-guided percutaneous RFA is a safe and efficacious alternative to laparoscopic adrenalectomy in treating patients with PA due to small APA.",cancer
"Pure desmoplastic melanoma: a melanoma with distinctive clinical behavior. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the excision margin necessary for desmoplastic melanoma (DM). BACKGROUND: DM consists of 2 histologic subtypes, pure DM (PDM) and mixed DM (MDM), differing in extent of fibrotic component. We investigated clinical and therapeutic determinants of prognosis in these DM entities. METHODS: We reviewed 118 PDM and 124 MDM treated at our Institute over 25 years. Local relapse, distant metastasis, and survival were studied. RESULTS: Most (91.7%) distant metastases in PDM developed after 1 or more local recurrences; whereas distant metastasis usually (79.6%) occurred as first event in MDM. Overall mortality trends in relation to lesion-thickness-plus-excision-width differed for PDM (P = 0.014) but not MDM (P = 0.185). For PDM, 5-year crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of mortality was higher (40.0%) for thin tumors (</= 2 mm thick) excised with 1 cm margin than those excised with 2 cm (14.8%); CCI of mortality for PDM > 2 mm thick excised with 2 cm margins (13.4%) was similar to that for thin PDM lesions excised with 2 cm (14.8%). CCI of local recurrence was also greater in PDM excised with 1 cm margins. In MDM, mortality increased with stage but was independent of excision width (CCI: 29.4% for </= 2 mm/2 cm, 31.3% for </= 2 mm/1 cm, and 48.3% for > 2 mm/2 cm); a similar trend was found for MDM distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: In PDM, limited excision width is associated with significantly greater local recurrence and mortality; treatment should be excision with 2 cm margins even for thin lesions. MDM behaves similarly to other melanomas; treatment should follow guidelines on melanoma management.",cancer
"B7-h3 ligand expression by primary breast cancer and associated with regional nodal metastasis. OBJECTIVE: : B7 ligand family members have been shown to be important immunoregulatory factors in host tumor immune responses. We hypothesized that B7-H3, a coinhibitory factor, is expressed by primary breast cancer cells and associated with metastasis to regional tumor-draining lymph nodes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: : American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III primary breast cancers (n = 82) and normal breast specimens (n = 17) were assessed for B7-H3 expression using paraffin-embedded archival tissues. B7-H3 expression by breast cancer cells was assessed by a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and B7-H3 protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: : B7-H3 mRNA expression was detected in 32 of 82 (39%) primary breast tumors but not in normal breast tissues (P = 0.0029). B7-H3 expression in primary tumors significantly correlated with increasing tumor size, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P = 0.0071). B7-H3 expression was highly correlated to sentinel lymph node and overall number of lymph nodes with metastasis P = 0.003, and P = 0.004, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, B7-H3 mRNA expression of the primary tumor significantly predicted metastasis to regional lymph nodes (P = 0.021, and P = 0.023, respectively). Antibody staining analysis of paraffin-embedded archival tissue breast tumors and flow cytometry of breast cancer cell lines demonstrated B7-H3 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: : B7-H3 protein expressed by primary breast cancer cells is a tumor progression factor and is associated with extent of regional nodal metastasis.",cancer
"Does hepatic pedicle clamping affect disease-free survival following liver resection for colorectal metastases? OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of liver ischemia from hepatic pedicle clamping (HPC) on long-term outcome after hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). BACKGROUND: Liver resection offers the only chance of cure for patients with CRLM. Several clinical and pathologic factors have been reported as determinants of poor outcome after hepatectomy for CRLM. A controversial issue is that hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury from HPC may adversely affect long-term outcome by accelerating the outgrowth of residual hepatic micrometastases. METHODS: Patients undergoing liver resection for CRLM in 2 tertiary referral centers, between 1992 and 2008, were included. Disease-free survival and specific liver-free survival were analyzed according to the use, type, and duration of HPC. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-three patients had primary hepatectomy for CRLM. Hepatic pedicle clamping was performed in 355 patients (65.4%), and intermittently applied in 254 patients (71.5%). Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were 1.3% and 18.5%, respectively. Hepatic pedicle clamping had a highly significant impact in reducing the risk of blood transfusions and was not correlated with significantly higher postoperative morbidity. Liver recurrence rate was not significantly different according to the use, type, and duration of HPC, in patients resected after preoperative chemotherapy as well. On univariate analysis, HPC did not significantly affect overall and disease-free survival. These results were confirmed on the multivariate analysis where blood transfusions, primary tumor nodal involvement, and the size of CRLM of more than 5 cm prevailed as determinants of poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the safety and effectiveness of HPC and demonstrates that in the human situation, there is no evidence that HPC may adversely affect long-term outcome after hepatectomy for CRLM.",cancer
"Intraoperative bacterial translocation detected by bacterium-specific ribosomal rna-targeted reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the mesenteric lymph node strongly predicts postoperative infectious complications after major hepatectomy for biliary malignancies. BACKGROUND: There is little evidence indicating a causal linkage between bacterial translocation and postoperative infectious complication (POIC) in human studies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the occurrence of bacterial translocation in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and POIC with a sensitive quantitative method using bacterium-specific ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-targeted reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). METHODS: Patients who underwent major hepatectomy for biliary malignancies involving hepatic hilus were included in this study (n = 65). Mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested from the jejunal mesentery 2 times during the operation (MLN-1 harvested at laparotomy and MLN-2 harvested after tumor resection). Microorganisms were detected by a bacterium-specific rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR method. Perioperative factors and POIC were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: Of 65 patients, 51 completed the study. Microorganisms were detected in MLN-1 and MLN-2 in 15 (29.4%) and 19 (37.3%) patients, respectively. The detection of microorganisms in MLN-1 was significantly correlated with the incidence of preoperative cholangitis (P = 0.04), whereas the detection of microorganisms in MLN-2 was significantly correlated with the incidence of POIC (P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, a positive result for detection of microorganisms in MLN-2 was one of the independent predictive factors of POIC (odds ratio = 26.1). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative analysis of MLNs (especially MLN-2) by rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR can strongly predict the occurrence of POIC after hepatectomy for biliary malignancy. This method is more sensitive and faster at detection of microorganisms than the conventional culture method. Therefore, we can obtain the information of bacterial translocation immediately after the surgery and can select the group of patients with high risk for POIC.",cancer
"Laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases: surgical and long-term oncologic outcome. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the immediate and long-term outcome after laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases and difference between observed and predicted [Fong's and Basingstoke Predictive Index (BPI) scores] survivals. BACKGROUND: : Laparoscopic liver resection has been reported safe and feasible and improves postoperative course. The oncologic outcomes after resection of colorectal metastases are poorly reported. METHODS: Between August 1998 and January 2010, 122 patients underwent laparoscopic resection for colorectal liver metastases during 135 procedures at Rikshospitalet. Patients undergoing surgery between August 1998 and June 2009 were included in research analysis. The patients had median Fong's and BPI's scores of 2 (0-5) and 7 (0-23), respectively. Mainstream analysis of hospital data was done on intent-to-treat basis. Intraoperative incidents and postoperative complications were analyzed according to the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications. Median follow-up was 24 (0-100) months. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one liver resections were performed in 107 patients during 118 procedures: 117 nonanatomic and 34 anatomic liver resections. There were 5 conversions to laparotomy (4.2%). The resection margin was free of tumor tissue in 141 (93.4%) of 151 specimens, and the distance between the resection margin and tumor tissue was median 6 (0-40) mm. Intraoperative incidents occurred in 14 cases (11.9%), including 5 (4.2%), 8 (6.8%), and 1 (0.8%) cases of grades I, II, and III, respectively. Postoperative complications were observed in 16 cases (14.3%), including 2, 3, 7, 3, 0, and 1 cases of grades I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and V, respectively. During follow-up, 21 patients received repeat liver resection of recurrences (11 by laparoscopy and 10 by laparotomy). The 5-year overall survival rates were 51% as laparoscopically completed cases and 47% as intent-to-treat. The observed actuarial survival values exceeded the values expected by Fong's and BPI's score, with 10.2% and 6.7% as laparoscopically completed cases and with 3.8% and 2.4% as intent-to-treat, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic resection is a favorable alternative to open liver resection for patients with colorectal liver metastases. The observed actuarial survival values after laparoscopic resection surpass the values expected by major scoring systems.",cancer
"Pathologic complete response of primary tumor following preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: long-term outcomes and prognostic significance of pathologic nodal status (KROG 09-01). OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term outcomes of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients with postchemoradiotherapy (post-CRT) pathologic complete response of primary tumor (ypT0) and determine prognostic significance of post-CRT pathologic nodal (ypN) status. BACKGROUND: LARC patients with post-CRT pathologic complete response were suggested to have favorable long-term outcomes, but prognostic significance of ypN status has never been specifically defined in ypT0 patients. METHODS: The Korean Radiation Oncology Group collected clinical data for 333 LARC patients with ypT0 following preoperative CRT and curative radical resections between 1993 and 2007. Sphincter preservation surgery and abdominoperineal resection were performed in 283 (85.0%) and 50 (15.0%) patients, respectively. Postoperative chemotherapy was given to 285 (85.6%) patients. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: After median follow-up of 43 (range = 14-172) months, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 84.6% and overall survival (OS) was 92.8%. The ypN status was ypT0N0 in 304 (91.3%), ypT0N1 in 22 (6.6%), and ypT0N2 in 7 (2.1%) patients. The ypN status was the most relevant independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS in ypT0 patients. The 5-year DFS and OS was 88.5% and 94.8% in ypT0N0 patients, and 45.2% and 72.8% in ypT0N+ patients (both, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LARC patients achieving ypT0N0 after preoperative CRT had favorable long-term outcomes, whereas positive ypN status had a poor prognosis even after total regression of primary tumor.",cancer
"Elastica staining for venous invasion results in superior prediction of cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic implications of routine elastica staining for venous invasion on prediction of cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Venous invasion is an important high risk feature in colorectal cancer, although prevalence in published studies ranges from 10% to 90%. To resolve the disparity, elastica stains have been used in our institution to provide a more objective judgment since 2002. METHODS: The study included 419 patients undergoing curative elective colorectal cancer resection between 1997 and 2006. Patients were grouped prior to (1997-2001 [cohort 1]) and following the introduction of elastica staining (2003-2006 [cohort 2]). FINDINGS: Clinicopathologic characteristics and 3-year survival rates were similar in both groups. Rate of detected venous invasion increased from 18% to 58% following introduction of elastica staining (P < 0.001). The 3-year cancer-specific survival rate associated with the absence of venous invasion was 84% in cohort 1, compared with 96% in cohort 2 (P < 0.01). Elastica staining improved the prognostic value of venous invasion, showing the area under the receiver operator curve rising from 0.59 (P = 0.040; 1997-2001) to 0.68 (P < 0.001; 2003-2006), using cancer mortality as an end point. A direct comparison between H&E alone and elastica Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) was made in 53 patients. The area under the receiver operator curve increased from 0.58, P = 0.293 (H&E alone) to 0.74, P = 0.003 for venous invasion detected using the elastica method. CONCLUSIONS: Increased detection of venous invasion with elastica staining, compared with H&E staining, provides superior prediction of cancer survival in colorectal cancer. This relationship was seen in the comparison of 2 consecutive cohorts and in a direct comparison in a single cohort. Based on these results, elastica staining should be incorporated into the routine pathologic assessment of venous invasion in colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Factors predicting the quality of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine preoperative tumor-, patient-, and treatment-related factors that are independently associated with incomplete mesorectal excision. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Incomplete total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer is associated with increased local and overall recurrences. Factors predicting incomplete mesorectal excision have scarcely been studied. METHODS: In the context of PROCARE, a Belgian multidisciplinary project on rectal cancer, the quality of 266 consecutive and anonymized TME specimens submitted by 33 candidate-TME-trainers was graded by a blinded pathology review board in a standardized manner. Uni- and multivariable analysis were performed to identify factors that can independently predict incomplete mesorectal excision. RESULTS: Mesorectal resection was complete in 21%, nearly complete in 47%, and incomplete in 32%. Of 57% of TME specimens the grade of resection had not been reported by the local pathologist. Incomplete TME doubled the incidence of a positive circumferential resection margin (P = 0.004). Factors found to be significantly related to incomplete TME in univariate analysis were as follows: surgeon, female gender, pathologic body mass index, low rectal cancer, negative clinical nodal status, the absence of downstaging after long-course chemoradiation, laparoscopic and converted laparoscopic resection, and abdominoperineal resection. Multivariable analysis identified pathologic body mass index (P = 0.017), the absence of downstaging after long-course chemoradiation (P = 0.0005), and laparoscopic or converted laparoscopic resection (P = 0.014) as factors that are independently associated with incomplete mesorectal excision. CONCLUSION: Good TME quality cannot be guaranteed. This peer-reviewed TME assessment revealed a number of factors that are independently related to incomplete TME. Both specimen and pathology report need to be audited.",cancer
"A randomized trial comparing radiofrequency ablation and surgical resection for HCC conforming to the Milan criteria. OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term outcomes of surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a promising, emerging therapy for small HCC. Whether it is as effective as surgical resection (RES) for long-term outcomes is still indefinite. METHODS: Two hundred thirty HCC patients who met the Milan criteria and were suitable to be treated by either RES or RFA entered into a randomized controlled trial. The patients were regularly followed up after treatment for 5 years (except for those who died). The primary end point was overall survival; the secondary end points were recurrence-free survival, overall recurrence, and early-stage recurrence. RESULTS: The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year overall survival rates for the RFA group and the RES group were 86.96%, 76.52%, 69.57%, 66.09%, 54.78% and 98.26%, 96.52%, 92.17%, 82.60%, 75.65%, respectively. The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates for the 2 groups were 81.74%, 59.13%, 46.08%, 33.91%, 28.69% and 85.22%, 73.92%, 60.87%, 54.78%, 51.30%, respectively. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were significantly lower in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.017). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year overall recurrence rates were 16.52%, 38.26%, 49.57%, 59.13%, and 63.48% for the RFA group and 12.17%, 22.60%, 33.91%, 39.13%, and 41.74% for the RES group. The overall recurrence was higher in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection may provide better survival and lower recurrence rates than RFA for patients with HCC to the Milan criteria.",cancer
"Thyroid transcription factor-1 expression in breast carcinomas. Immunostaining for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is frequently used to help assess the site of origin of metastatic carcinomas. TTF-1 expression is most frequently seen in carcinomas of thyroid and lung origin. Furthermore, it has been assumed that the expression of TTF-1 in a carcinoma excludes the possibility of a breast origin. We have recently encountered in our consultation practice 4 cases of invasive breast carcinoma (confirmed by clinical findings and other immunophenotypic features) that showed unequivocal tumor cell expression of TTF-1. However, the frequency with which TTF-1 expression is observed in breast carcinomas is unknown. To address this, we carried out immunostaining for TTF-1 on 546 primary breast carcinomas submitted for routine estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and/or HER2 testing. Cases were considered TTF-1 positive if they showed any nuclear staining for this marker. TTF-1 expression was identified in 13 cases (2.4%). Expression varied from focal and weak to diffuse and strong and was seen in both invasive and in situ components. We conclude that a small proportion of breast carcinomas show TTF-1 expression. Therefore, the presence of TTF-1 immunoreactivity in a carcinoma cannot by itself be used to exclude the possibility of a breast origin.",cancer
"Macroscopic sertoli cell nodule: a study of 6 cases that presented as testicular masses. Sertoli cell nodules are almost always incidental microscopic lesions found in both cryptorchid and normally descended testes. Sertoli cell nodules, when present as masses or ultrasonographic lesions, may create diagnostic confusion. Herein, we report 6 cases of macroscopic Sertoli cell nodules that were received in consultation. The referral diagnoses included Sertoli cell tumor (2 cases), sex cord tumor with annular tubules (1 case), and gonadoblastoma (1 case). The patients were 19 to 36 years old: 3 patients presented with palpable testicular masses and 3 with lesions that were worrisome for neoplasms in ultrasonographic examinations conducted for pain (2 cases) or infertility (1 case). All were phenotypically normal male patients who lacked endocrine symptoms. The Sertoli cell nodules ranged from 6 to 10 mm in diameter and on microscopic examination consisted of circumscribed proliferations of immature Sertoli cells, globules and trabeculae of basement membrane, and spermatogonia in varying proportions. In 2 cases the lesion was distinctly intratubular, consisting of closely packed tubules containing various components; in the other cases there was confluent growth of the tubules. Immunostains for alpha-inhibin highlighted the Sertoli cells (5 of 5 cases), with the germ cells appearing in negative relief. An antibody for testis-specific protein, Y-encoded (TSPY), stained the spermatogonia (2 of 2 cases), whereas OCT 3/4 was negative in all the cases (5 of 5 cases). We conclude that Sertoli cell nodules may present clinically as mass lesions, and that it is important to distinguish them from true neoplasms to avoid unnecessary procedures.",cancer
"Expression of Her-2 in carcinomas of the esophagus. The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 gene (HER-2) encodes for a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase (Her-2), which is overexpressed in various human cancers. Her-2-targeted therapy has recently been shown to be beneficial for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Her-2 protein expression was investigated in 341 esophageal carcinomas [152 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 189 adenocarcinomas (AC)], 39 cases of Barrett mucosa, and 11 cases of squamous cell dysplasia. HER-2 gene amplification was assessed by colorimetric in-situ hybridization. Positive Her-2 status was found in 15.3% of ACs and 3.9% of SCCs. Positive Her-2-status was more common in dysplastic Barrett mucosas compared with nondysplastic ones (P=0.04). In 26% of the patients with ACs who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=39), the Her-2 status of pretherapeutic biopsies was different compared with subsequent surgical specimens. There was no statistically significant correlation between Her-2 status and patients' survival. Although Her-2 overexpression is rare in SCCs, it is found in 15.3% of ACs, where amplification of HER-2 gene and overexpression of Her-2 protein seem to be early events in carcinogenesis. The evaluation of Her-2 status in tumor biopsies and in particular in the context with possible alterations after neoadjuvant treatment can potentially lead to false Her-2-staging. Although Her-2-overexpression in esophageal cancer seems to have no influence on patients' survival, these subtypes of esophageal ACs have to be considered as targets for an anti-Her-2 therapy.",cancer
"Prostate cancer topography and patterns of lymph node metastasis. Pelvic lymph node (LN) metastasis is a well-recognized route of prostate cancer spread. However, the relationship between topography and the pathologic features of primary prostatic cancers and patterns of pelvic LN metastasis has not been well studied. We reviewed original slides of radical prostatectomies and pelvic LN dissections from 125 patients with LN metastasis and recorded a total number of LN excised/laterality of positive LN, and localization, staging parameters, lymphovascular invasion, and volume of primary tumors. LN QUANTITY AND DISTRIBUTION: 14.6 (mean) and 13 (median) LNs were resected. Seventy-six (61%), 33 (26%), and 16 (13%) cases had 1, 2, and >2 positive LNs; whereas 58, 44, and 20 cases had LN metastasis on the right, left, and bilaterally. PATHOLOGIC FEATURES: Eighty-six percent (108 of 125) and 37% (46 of 125) of the cases showed extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion, whereas 64% cases showed lymphovascular invasion. Mean and median total tumor volumes were 6.39 and 3.92 cm, with >/=50% and >/=90% Gleason patterns 4/5 in 105 (84%) and 73 (58%) cases, respectively. CORRELATION WITH DOMINANT TUMOR LOCATION: Dominant lesions on radical prostatectomy were as follows: 50 right lobe, 44 left lobe, and 31 bilateral lobe tumors. Fifteen of 50 (30%) right lobe and 18 of 44 (41%) left lobe dominant tumors had LN metastasis on the contralateral side. Only 4% (5 of 125) of the cases were associated with anterior dominant tumors. CONCLUSION: Thirty percent to 40% of LN metastases occurred contralateral to the dominant tumor. LN metastasis is overwhelmingly associated with high-grade, high-stage, and large volume disease. LN positivity is rarely associated with anterior dominant tumors.",cancer
"Primary leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas: study of 9 cases and review of literature. Primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas are rare lesions and not well described, yet they are the most common primary pancreatic sarcoma. English-language medical literature reports 29 cases as single cases or small series. A systematized nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED) search of Mayo Clinic surgical pathology files from 1994 to 2006 identified 22 primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas. Nine patients with pancreatic leiomyosarcoma were diagnosed and treated at our institution (5 males and 4 females; mean age at diagnosis, 63 y; range, 39 to 87 y) are described, with a literature review. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA (EBER) was conducted in all cases to exclude EBV-associated smooth muscle tumor (EBV-SMT). Seven of the 9 patients presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice. Seven tumors (mean, 10.7 cm; range, 1.0 to 30 cm) were located in the pancreatic head and 2 in the tail. Histologic findings of primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas (7 spindle and 2 epithelioid) were similar to leiomyosarcomas of other sites. All tumors stained positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin and negative for KIT. No case showed EBER positivity. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was done in 4 patients; 3 patients had palliative procedures, and 2 had biopsy only. No lymph node metastasis was identified in 4 resected tumors, but liver metastases were present in 4 patients. All patients died; 5 deaths were known to be disease related (overall mean survival, 31 months; range, 5 to 98 mo). Historical cases showed similar clinicopathologic findings. These pancreatic leiomyosarcoma lesions have the same morphologic features as their counterparts of other sites. EBER testing should be conducted--especially for pediatric patients--to rule out EBV-SMT. The tumor is likely to metastasize to liver but not regional lymph nodes. Extensive surgical resection should be advocated, even when morphologic results show a low-grade lesion.",cancer
"Oct4 expression in immature teratoma of the ovary: relevance to histologic grade and degree of differentiation. Immature teratoma of the ovary is an uncommon tumor comprising 1% of ovarian malignancies. The amount of immature neuroepithelium in the teratoma is an important prognostic factor. Although the current grading system based on this criterion is widely accepted, the biological significance of immature neuroepithelium is poorly understood. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of Oct4 (also known as Oct3 or POU5F1), a transcription factor expressed in primordial germ cells and embryonic stem cells, along with that of PAX6, a transcription factor contributing to neurogenesis, and CD56, a known marker for tumors of neural origin, in 18 cases of pure immature teratoma of the ovary. Oct4 was expressed in the immature neuroepithelium of all 7 grade-3 cases and 2 grade-2 cases. It was not expressed in 4 grade-2 cases and all 5 grade-1 cases. These tumor cells lacked CD30 or alpha-fetoprotein expression, which supported the diagnosis of pure immature teratoma. PAX6 was expressed in the immature neuroepithelium of all immature teratomas, but not in Oct4-positive cells. CD56 was expressed in neural components of various maturities including PAX6-positive immature neuroepithelium, but not in Oct4-positive cells. These data suggest that the expression of these markers probably reflects the differentiation status of neural tissue in immature teratomas. The finding that Oct4 expression was exclusively detected in immature neuroepithelium of high-grade immature teratomas indicates that Oct4 might serve as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of highly malignant cases of immature teratoma.",cancer
"Cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas have distinctive features and include 2 subsets. Cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas (CMZL) were segregated in the WHO/EORTC consensus classification but grouped with other MALT lymphomas in the subsequent WHO classification. It has been suggested, however, that CMZL have distinctive features and might include 2 subsets. To address these issues, the clinicopathologic, phenotypic and, when possible, genotypic features of 29 CMZL with plasmacytic differentiation were assessed. The monotypic plasma cells had class-switched heavy chain expression in 22 cases, technically inadequate staining in 1 case (included with class-switched cases for analysis) and 6 were IgM. The class-switched cases had a predominance of T cells in 22 out of 23 cases with a CD4:CD8>1 in 15 out of 16 cases, usually showed nodules and scattered small B cells often with IgD apparently nonneoplastic follicles, lacked CXCR3 B-cell expression, never showed a totally diffuse growth pattern, often had prominent mast cells, and lacked known extracutaneous involvement. The IgM cases showed a predominance of B cells in 5 out of 6 (P=0.0003), a diffuse proliferation of CD20 B cells in all (P<0.0001), CXCR3+ B cells in 2 out of 5 (P<0.04), and extracutaneous disease in 3 out of 6 (P<0.008). CD21 usually disrupted follicular dendritic meshworks were seen in 9 out of 12 class-switched and 5 out of 5 IgM cases. CD123 plasmacytoid dendritic cells, PD1+ T follicular helper cells, CD25 or FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, and TIA1/granzyme B cytotoxic cells were never numerous. Only 1 out of 14 tested cases showed a low-level clonal/oligoclonal T cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement. These findings support the presence of 2 types of cutaneous MALT lymphomas with the class-switched cases being the most distinctive but still sharing significant features with MALT lymphomas from other sites, specifically an extranodal extramedullary CD5-, CD10- indolent small B cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation, frequent benign follicular structures, and not fulfilling the criteria for any other well-defined lymphoma.",cancer
"A histology-based model for predicting microsatellite instability in colorectal cancers. Identifying colorectal cancers (CRCs) with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is clinically important. MSI-H is a positive prognostic marker for CRC, a predictive marker for resistance to standard 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, and an important feature for identifying individuals and families with Lynch syndrome. Our aim was to compare and improve upon the existing predictive pathology models for MSI-H CRCs. We tested 2 existing models used to predict MSI-H tumors, (1) Revised Bethesda Guidelines and (2) MsPath, in our population-based cohort of CRCs diagnosed less than 75 years from Newfoundland (N=710). We also scored additional histologic features not described in the other models. From this analysis, we developed a model for the prediction of MSI-H CRCs; Pathologic Role in Determination of Instability in Colorectal Tumors (PREDICT). An independent pathologist validated this model in a second cohort of all CRCs (N=276). Tumor histology was a better predictor of MSI status than was personal and family history of cancer. MsPath identified MSI-H CRCs with a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 37.8%, whereas the Revised Bethesda Guidelines had a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 39.5%. PREDICT included some new histology features, including peritumoral lymphocytic reaction and increased proportion of plasma cells in the tumor stroma. PREDICT was superior to both existing models in the development cohort with a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 53.9%. In the validation cohort, sensitivity was 96.9% and specificity 76.6%. We conclude that PREDICT is a good predictor of MSI-H CRC.",cancer
"Optimal immunohistochemical markers for distinguishing lung adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas in small tumor samples. The histologic subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma is important in selecting appropriate chemotherapy for patients with advanced disease. As many of these patients are not operative candidates, they are treated medically after biopsy for diagnosis. Inherent limitations of small biopsy samples can make distinguishing poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) difficult. The value of histochemical and immunohistochemical markers to help separate poorly differentiated ADC from SCC in resection specimens is well established; however, the optimal use of markers in small tissue samples has only recently been examined and the correlation of marker expression in small tissue samples with histologic subtype determined on resection specimens has not been well documented. We address this issue by examining the expression of 9 markers (p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, 34betaE12, Napsin A, mucicarmine, NTRK1, and NTRK2) on 200 cases of ADC and 225 cases of SCC in tissue microarray format to mimic small tissue specimens. The single best marker to separate ADC from SCC is p63 (for SCC: sensitivity 84%, specificity 85%). Logistic regression analysis identifies p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, Napsin A, and mucicarmine as the optimal panel to separate ADC from SCC. Reduction of the panel to p63, TTF1, CK5/6, and CK7 is marginally less effective but may be the best compromise when tissue is limited. We present an algorithm for the stepwise application of p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, Napsin A, and mucicarmine in situations in which separation of ADC from SCC in small specimens cannot be accomplished by morphology alone.",cancer
"Neoadjuvant therapy induces loss of MSH6 expression in colorectal carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are routinely used to detect abnormal DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression in colorectal carcinomas, particularly when Lynch syndrome is suspected. Complete loss of MMR protein expression is often associated with underlying microsatellite instability (MSI), and the combined results of mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), or mutS homolog 6 (MSH6) immunostains may point to the defective MMR protein in tumors with MSI. We have noted that some neoadjuvantly treated colorectal carcinomas display loss of MMR protein immunoexpression, despite a lack of underlying MSI and preserved staining in pretreatment tumor samples. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of this finding. We identified 51 neoadjuvantly treated resected colorectal cancers. Posttreatment tumor samples were immunohistochemically stained with MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 antibodies. Loss of staining for any marker was followed by analysis for MSI and assessment of MMR protein expression in pretreatment tumor samples. All of the 51 posttreatment tumor samples showed preserved MLH1, PMS2, and MSH2, but 10 posttreatment tumor samples (20%) showed decreased MSH6 staining. Of these, 9 posttreatment tumor samples displayed loss of staining in less than 100% of tumor cells, but preserved MSH6 expression in pretreatment tumor samples. One case showed a complete absence of MSH6 staining in both pretreatment and posttreatment tumor samples. All 10 cases were microsatellite stable. We conclude that extensive loss of MSH6 immunoexpression is common among neoadjuvantly treated colorectal carcinomas, but generally does not reflect underlying MSI. Therefore, diminished MSH6 staining in treated tumors should prompt immunohistochemical evaluation of pretreatment biopsy samples before genetic testing for Lynch syndrome.",cancer
"Gastric cardiac polyps: a clinicopathologic study of 330 cases. As endoscopists have become more skilled in sampling the gastroesophageal junction, pathologists are being increasingly challenged to characterize previously unknown or neglected findings. One such example is the cardiac polyp. Originally described in the radiology literature as the sentinel fold, the first histologic descriptions of polyps at the gastroesophageal junction did not appear until less than a decade ago. Current clinicopathologic information is limited and somewhat conflicting. This study was designed to define the clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic associations in patients with cardiac polyps. Using an electronic database, we extracted information on all patients who had a distal esophageal or esophagogastric junctional biopsy during a 24-month period. We then reviewed the slides of 330 adult patients diagnosed with a cardiac polyp and used semiquantitative or qualitative scales to score foveolar hyperplasia, inflammation, erosion or ulcers, epithelial type, and metaplasia. As controls we used 120,487 patients who had biopsies from the same anatomic sites during the same period, but were not diagnosed with a cardiac polyp. There were no significant differences among any clinical indications for esophagogastroduodenoscopy between study and control patients. Endoscopically, a polyp or nodule at the gastroesophageal junction was noted in 59.1% of the patients who had a histopathologic diagnosis of cardiac polyp. Histologically, Barrett mucosa, active esophagitis, and Helicobactor pylori gastritis were all significantly less common in patients with a cardiac polyp than in controls. Although relatively infrequent, synchronous hyperplastic polyps elsewhere in the stomach were significantly more common in patients than in controls. In conclusion, this large series suggests that cardiac polyps are rare but histologically distinct lesions. They are benign and are not uniquely associated with esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, reactive gastropathy, or gastritis, with or without H. pylori.",cancer
"Spectrum of pilomyxoid astrocytomas: intermediate pilomyxoid tumors. To define the spectrum of pilomyxoid morphology and to characterize the association between pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PMA) and pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), 84 cases of pediatric astrocytomas with pilomyxoid features were reviewed. Forty-two of these tumors had coexistent features of PMA and PA (""intermediate""). With the accumulation of more cytoplasm, fibrillar background, microcysts, and thickened blood vessels, these intermediate tumors were more PA-like and less like classic PMA. In the recurrent specimens, PMAs and intermediate tumors sometimes showed more prominent PA features. Both PMA and intermediate tumors involved sites outside the hypothalamus, optic chiasm, and the third ventricle. Both the existence of intermediate tumors and the finding that some PMAs and intermediate tumors mature into PA-like neoplasms over time, provided strong support for a biological relationship between PMA and PA. Additional evidence for a ""maturational effect"" was the finding that intermediate tumors occurred in patients with a median age of 36 months compared with the median age of 21 months for those with PMAs (P=0.017). Features that were often assumed to be poor prognostic indicators in gliomas, that is, necrosis, mitotic figures, and vascular proliferation, were not uncommon in typical PMAs and intermediate lesions. Further follow-up is needed to more accurately determine the prognosis of intermediate tumors.",cancer
"EBV-associated cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphoma: review of a series of 14 cases from peru in children and young adults. We have reviewed clinically, morphologically, and immunophenotypically a series of 14 Epstein-Bar virus (EBV)+ cutaneous natural killer cell (NK)/T-cell lymphoma from Peru. Most (11 out of 14) of these cases fit well into the category of Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma (HVLL), but 3 have a different clinical presentation, without facial involvement. In all 14 cases, skin lesions present in both the sun-exposed and nonexposed areas exhibited a slowly progressive relapsing course, changing from edema, to blistering, ulceration, and final scarring. The immunophenotype had a cytotoxic T or NK-cell lineage. The mean time of disease before admission to hospital was 69 months (range, 6 mo to 31 y). Only 2 patients had fever, hepatosplenomegaly, systemic lymphadenopathy, and a high lactate dehydrodenage (LDH) level at the time of diagnosis, whereas 10 had facial swelling. After treatment, only 4 patients remain alive, although with persistent disease. Ten patients died after a mean follow-up of 11.6 months after the initial diagnosis (range, 1 to 32 mo), because of concurrent infections (4 cases), disease progression (4 patients) or both (2 patients). Endemic Epstein-Bar virus (EBV)-positive cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in childhood and early adulthood are characterized by a protracted clinical course, eventually leading to an aggressive phase characterized by concurrent infections and disease progression.",cancer
"Fetal lung interstitial tumor (FLIT): A proposed newly recognized lung tumor of infancy to be differentiated from cystic pleuropulmonary blastoma and other developmental pulmonary lesions. The differential diagnosis of congenital lung lesions includes a variety of pulmonary malformations, and uncommon or rare neoplasms such as the pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) and congenital peribronchial myofibroblastic tumor (CPMT). Although most of the congenital lesions have a predominantly cystic appearance, the exceptions of a more solid process are the type 3 congenital cystic adenomatoid or pulmonary airway malformation (CCAM-CPAM) and the CPMT. The clinical and pathologic features of a unique solid or mixed solid/cystic lung mass composed of immature interstitial mesenchyme in association with irregular airspace-like structures mimicking abnormal incompletely developed lung are presented in this report of 10 infants (7 males, 3 females) whose tumor-like lesions were detected in the prenatal period to 3 months of age (median, 1-day old). A lobectomy was done in all 10 infants and 1 infant received adjuvant chemotherapy. One of the surgical resections occurred as an ex utero, antenatal procedure because of fetal ascites. There have been no reported recurrences in those patients with greater than 12 months of follow-up ranging from 15 to 182 months (9 cases). Because of the morphologic resemblance of this mass-like lesion to fetal lung at 20 to 24 weeks gestation (as though any further pulmonary development was arrested in these localized lesions), we are proposing the designation of fetal lung interstitial tumor (FLIT) whose pathogenetic relationship, if any, to type 1 (cystic) pleuropulmonary blastoma remains uncertain to date.",cancer
"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis: insights gained over 4 decades. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disease involving predominantly the lung, and there is uncertainty about its relationship to lymphoma. It affects mainly middle-aged adults, although there is a wide age range, and men are affected almost twice as often as women. Multiple nodular, usually bilateral, infiltrates are seen radiographically, and extrapulmonary involvement, especially of skin and nervous system, occurs in more than one third of the patients. Mortality rates are high, and treatment modes are not well established. Morphologically, there is a nodular polymorphous mononuclear cell infiltrate with prominent vascular infiltration and often necrosis. Varying numbers of large, often atypical, CD20-positive B-lymphocytes are present within a background containing numerous CD3-positive small T lymphocytes and scattered admixed plasma cells and histiocytes. Evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection can be shown in most cases by in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus RNA. The infiltrate is graded as 1 to 3 based on the proportion of large B cells. Morphologically, there is overlap in grades 2 and 3 with variants of large B-cell lymphoma, and many such cases show evidence of monoclonality by polymerase chain reaction. It is suggested that lymphoma (T-cell rich large B-cell or diffuse large B-cell) be diagnosed in addition to lymphomatoid granulomatosis in grades 2 and 3 to appropriately communicate the nature of the disease to clinicians.",cancer
"Reduced mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances have been made in the care of patients undergoing transplantation. We conducted a study to determine whether these advances have improved the outcomes of transplantation. METHODS: We analyzed overall mortality, mortality not preceded by relapse, recurrent malignant conditions, and the frequency and severity of major complications of transplantation, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and infectious complications, among 1418 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants at our center in Seattle in the period from 1993 through 1997 and among 1148 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants in the period from 2003 through 2007. Components of the Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score were used in regression models to adjust for the severity of illness at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: In the 2003-2007 period, as compared with the 1993-1997 period, we observed significant decreases in mortality not preceded by relapse, both at day 200 (by 60%) and overall (by 52%), the rate of relapse or progression of a malignant condition (by 21%), and overall mortality (by 41%), after adjustment for components of the PAM score. The results were similar when the analyses were limited to patients who received myeloablative conditioning therapy. We also found significant decreases in the risk of severe GVHD; disease caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal infections; and damage to the liver, kidneys, and lungs. CONCLUSIONS: We found a substantial reduction in the hazard of death related to allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation, as well as increased long-term survival, over the past decade. Improved outcomes appear to be related to reductions in organ damage, infection, and severe acute GVHD. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).",cancer
"Volume measurement of liver metastases using multidetector computed tomography: comparison of lesion diameter and volume segmentation - a phantom study. PURPOSE: To compare lesion volume determination by applying diameter measurement and three different segmentation algorithms at different slice thicknesses reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) of a phantom model for hepatic colorectal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on CT attenuation measurements obtained retrospectively from 20 patients with colorectal liver metastases, a phantom model was designed with a sponge soaked with a dilution of contrast agent and 6 embedded polyamide spheres (diameter, 8 - 30 mm) to simulate the contrast behavior of liver metastases. CT scans were obtained and reconstructed at different slice thicknesses (0.625/1.25/2.5/3.75 mm; increment, 1). One observer performed software-aided volume determination using the maximum diameter, manual segmentation, seed point method, and threshold method six times for each lesion in a randomized order. Statistical analysis revealed the absolute and relative differences from the actual lesion volumes and the intraobserver differences as well as the influence of slice thickness for each method. RESULTS: The mean relative differences of the seed point method (1.2 - 5.9%) and manual segmentation (2.6 - 4.9%) were significantly lower than the threshold method (5.4 - 12.8%) and diameter measurement (12.3 - 18.5%; p < 0.01). Volume determination by manual segmentation and the seed point method benefited from the use of thin-slice CT datasets. The intraobserver variation was lowest when using the manual segmentation (1.5 - 3.3%) and the seed point method (2.2 - 3.9%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Manual segmentation and the seed point method for thin CT slices were the methods with the lowest volume differences and intraobserver variation.",cancer
"Asymmetric cell division: recent developments and their implications for tumour biology. The ability of cells to divide asymmetrically is essential for generating diverse cell types during development. The past 10 years have seen tremendous progress in our understanding of this important biological process. We have learned that localized phosphorylation events are responsible for the asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants in mitosis and that centrosomes and microtubules play important parts in this process. The relevance of asymmetric cell division for stem cell biology has added a new dimension to the field, and exciting connections between asymmetric cell division and tumorigenesis have begun to emerge.",cancer
"MET signalling: principles and functions in development, organ regeneration and cancer. The MET tyrosine kinase receptor (also known as the HGF receptor) promotes tissue remodelling, which underlies developmental morphogenesis, wound repair, organ homeostasis and cancer metastasis, by integrating growth, survival and migration cues in response to environmental stimuli or cell-autonomous perturbations. The versatility of MET-mediated biological responses is sustained by qualitative and quantitative signal modulation. Qualitative mechanisms include the engagement of dedicated signal transducers and the subcellular compartmentalization of MET signalling pathways, whereas quantitative regulation involves MET partnering with adaptor amplifiers or being degraded through the shedding of its extracellular domain or through intracellular ubiquitylation. Controlled activation of MET signalling can be exploited in regenerative medicine, whereas MET inhibition might slow down tumour progression.",cancer
"Microgeographic variations in Burkitt's lymphoma incidence correlate with differences in malnutrition, malaria and Epstein-Barr virus. BACKGROUND: Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL) has been associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum malaria. But recent evidence suggests that other risk factors are involved. METHODS: We hypothesised that selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a surrogate of nutritional status, is an important biomarker for eBL risk. We measured plasma GPx, anthropometric markers of malnutrition, EBV viral loads and malaria parasitaemia in children aged 1-9 years (n=258) from two locations in Nyanza Province, Kenya, with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected incidence of eBL. The study participants were malaria asymptomatic children from the community. RESULTS: Children from eBL high-incidence areas had significantly lower GPx levels, high EBV viral load and more evidence of chronic malnutrition than children from eBL low-incidence areas (all P<0.001). Additionally, GPx levels were significantly lower in children with the highest EBV viral load and for those with P. falciparum infections (P=0.035 and P=0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that selenium deficiency may be a risk factor for eBL.",cancer
"Angiotensin-2 receptors (AT1-R and AT2-R), new prognostic factors for renal clear-cell carcinoma? BACKGROUND: The growth factor Angiotensin-2 signals through Angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1-R) in a broad range of cell types and tumours and through the type-2 receptor (AT2-R) in a more restricted group of cell types. Although numerous forms of cancer have been shown to overexpress AT1-R, expression of AT1-R and AT2-R by human renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCCC) is not well understood. In this study, the expression of both angiotensin receptors was quantified in a retrospective series of RCCC and correlated with prognostic factors. METHODS: Angiotensin receptor type 1 and AT2-R expressions were quantified on tumour tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). IHC results were correlated to Fuhrman's grade and patient progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 84 RCCC were analysed. By IHC, AT1-R and AT2-R were expressed to a greater level in high-grade tumours (AT1-R: P<0.001, AT2-R: P<0.001). Univariate analysis showed a correlation between PFS and AT1-R or AT2-R expression (P=0.001). By multivariate analysis, only AT2-R expression correlated with PFS (HR 1.021, P=0.006) and cancer stage (P<0.001). By western blot, AT1-R and AT1-R were also found to be overexpressed in higher Fuhrman's grade (P<0.01 and P=0.001 respectively). By qRT-PCR, AT1-R but not AT2-R mRNA were downregulated (P=0.001 and P=0.118, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results show that AT1-R and AT2-R proteins are overexpressed in the most aggressive forms of RCCC and that AT2-R expression correlates with PFS. AT1-R or AT2-R blockage could, therefore, offer novel directions for anti-RCCC therapy.",cancer
"Surveillance of screening-detected cancers (colon and rectum, breast, and cervix) - United States, 2004-2006. PROBLEM/CONDITION: Population-based screening is conducted to detect diseases or other conditions in persons before symptoms appear; effective screening leads to early detection and treatment, thereby reducing disease-associated morbidity and mortality. Based on systematic reviews of the evidence of the benefits and harms and assessments of the net benefit of screening, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends population-based screening for colon and rectum cancer, female breast cancer, and uterine cervix cancer. Few publications have used national data to examine the stage at diagnosis of these screening-amenable cancers. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2004-2006. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: Data were obtained from cancer registries affiliated with CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Combined data from the NPCR and SEER programs provide the best source of information on national population-based cancer incidence. Data on cancer screening were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This report provides stage-specific cancer incidence rates and screening prevalence by demographic characteristics and U.S. state. RESULTS: Approximately half of colorectal and cervical cancer cases and one third of breast cancer cases were diagnosed at a late stage of disease. Incidence rates of late-stage cancer differed by age, race/ethnicity, and state. Incidence rates of late-stage colorectal cancer increased with age and were highest among black men and women. Incidence rates of late-stage breast cancer were highest among women aged 60-79 years and black women. Incidence rates of late-stage cervical cancer were highest among women aged 50-79 years and Hispanic women. The percentage of persons who received recommended screening differed by age, race/ethnicity, and state. INTERPRETATION: Differences in late-stage cancer incidence rates might be explained partially by differences in screening use. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The findings in this report emphasize the need for ongoing population-based surveillance and reporting to monitor late-stage cancer incidence trends. Screening can identify colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers in earlier and more treatable stages of disease. Multiple factors, including individual characteristics and health behaviors as well as provider and clinical systems factors, might account for why certain populations are underscreened. Cancer control planners, including comprehensive cancer-control programs, can use late-stage cancer incidence and screening prevalence data to identify populations that would benefit from interventions to increase screening utilization and to monitor performance of early detection programs.",cancer
"Racial disparities in smoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost --- Missouri, 2003-2007. An estimated 443,000 deaths in the United States occur each year as a result of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. These deaths cost the nation approximately $97 billion in lost productivity and $96 billion in health-care costs. During 2000-2004 in Missouri, smoking caused 9,600 deaths, 132,000 years of potential life lost (YPLL), $2.4 billion in productivity losses, and $2.2 billion in smoking-related health-care expenditures annually. To limit the adverse health consequences of tobacco use, states implement comprehensive tobacco control programs that identify disparities among population groups and target those disproportionately affected by tobacco use. This report compares the public health burden of smoking among whites and blacks in Missouri by estimating the number of smoking-attributable deaths and YPLL in these population subgroups during 2003-2007. The findings indicate that the average annual smoking-attributable mortality (SAM) rate in the state was 18% higher for blacks (338 deaths per 100,000) than for whites (286 deaths per 100,000). The relative difference in smoking-attributable mortality rates between blacks and whites was larger for men (28%) than women (11%). For Missouri, these estimates provide an important benchmark for measuring the success of tobacco control programs in decreasing the burden of smoking-related diseases in these populations and reaffirm the need for full implementation of the state's comprehensive tobacco control program.",cancer
"Predicting hematologic toxicity in patients undergoing radioimmunotherapy with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or 131I-tositumomab. This study aimed at identifying clinical factors for predicting hematologic toxicity after radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or (131)I-tositumomab in clinical practice. METHODS: Hematologic data were available from 14 non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and 18 who received (131)I-tositumomab. The percentage baseline at nadir and 4 wk post nadir and the time to nadir were selected as the toxicity indicators for both platelets and neutrophils. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors (P < 0.05) of each indicator. RESULTS: For both platelets and neutrophils, pooled and separate analyses of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and (131)I-tositumomab data yielded the time elapsed since the last chemotherapy as the only significant predictor of the percentage baseline at nadir. The extent of bone marrow involvement was not a significant factor in this study, possibly because of the short time elapsed since the last chemotherapy of the 7 patients with bone marrow involvement. Because both treatments were designed to deliver a comparable bone marrow dose, this factor also was not significant. None of the 14 factors considered was predictive of the time to nadir. The R(2) value for the model predicting percentage baseline at nadir was 0.60 for platelets and 0.40 for neutrophils. This model predicted the platelet and neutrophil toxicity grade to within +/-1 for 28 and 30 of the 32 patients, respectively. For the 7 patients predicted with grade I thrombocytopenia, 6 of whom had actual grade I-II, dosing might be increased to improve treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: The elapsed time since the last chemotherapy can be used to predict hematologic toxicity and customize the current dosing method in radioimmunotherapy.",cancer
"Evaluation of metabolic characteristics and viability of lipiodolized hepatocellular carcinomas using 18F-FDG PET/CT. This study aimed to evaluate the metabolic characteristics of lipiodolized hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in assessing the viability of lipiodolized HCCs. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (age range, 32-73 y) with 38 lipiodolized HCCs who had undergone transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with lipiodol before (18)F-FDG PET/CT (2-434 d) and 55 patients (age range, 36-77 y) with 57 treatment-naive HCCs who had not been treated with TACE were retrospectively studied. All patients underwent hepatic lobectomy or transplantation within 1 mo after PET/CT and multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT. (18)F-FDG uptake by lipiodolized and naive HCCs was compared and correlated with tumor size, pathologic grade, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration, and time interval between TACE and PET/CT. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT in evaluating the viability of lipiodolized HCC was compared. RESULTS: Histologic examination showed 30 viable and 8 nonviable lipiodolized HCCs. Of the 30 viable tumors, 19 showed increased, 10 similar, and 1 decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Of the 8 nonviable HCCs, 3 showed increased and 5 decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Uptake by viable lipiodolized HCCs was correlated with tumor size (P < 0.05) but not correlated with pathologic grade, AFP concentration, or interval between TACE and PET/CT. In contrast, (18)F-FDG uptake by naive HCCs was significantly correlated with tumor size and pathologic grade (P < 0.05 for each comparison). When lipiodolized HCCs with (18)F-FDG uptake that was greater than or similar to that in the surrounding normal liver were considered viable, the diagnostic sensitivity of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT in the early postembolic period (<3 mo) was 100% and 94%, respectively, and that in the late postembolic period was 93% and 79%, respectively. The specificity of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT was 63% and 100%, respectively, in the acute period. Three viable lipiodolized HCCs with high AFP concentration were true-positives on PET/CT but false-negatives on contrast-enhanced CT images. CONCLUSION: After TACE, (18)F-FDG uptake in lipiodolized HCCs was not correlated with pathologic grade, in contrast to uptake in treatment-naive HCCs. (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed a high diagnostic sensitivity in assessing the viability of lipiodolized HCCs, with moderate specificity. This method may be useful in determining the viability of lipiodolized HCCs in patients with increased serum AFP concentration or normal results on contrast-enhanced CT images.",cancer
"Mediastinoscopy vs endosonography for mediastinal nodal staging of lung cancer: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: Mediastinal nodal staging is recommended for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Surgical staging has limitations, which results in the performance of unnecessary thoracotomies. Current guidelines acknowledge minimally invasive endosonography followed by surgical staging (if no nodal metastases are found by endosonography) as an alternative to immediate surgical staging. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 2 recommended lung cancer staging strategies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled multicenter trial (Ghent, Leiden, Leuven, Papworth) conducted between February 2007 and April 2009 in 241 patients with resectable (suspected) NSCLC in whom mediastinal staging was indicated based on computed or positron emission tomography. INTERVENTION: Either surgical staging or endosonography (combined transesophageal and endobronchial ultrasound [EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA]) followed by surgical staging in case no nodal metastases were found at endosonography. Thoracotomy with lymph node dissection was performed when there was no evidence of mediastinal tumor spread. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was sensitivity for mediastinal nodal (N2/N3) metastases. The reference standard was surgical pathological staging. Secondary outcomes were rates of unnecessary thoracotomy and complications. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-one patients were randomized, 118 to surgical staging and 123 to endosonography, of whom 65 also underwent surgical staging. Nodal metastases were found in 41 patients (35%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27%-44%) by surgical staging vs 56 patients (46%; 95% CI, 37%-54%) by endosonography (P = .11) and in 62 patients (50%; 95% CI, 42%-59%) by endosonography followed by surgical staging (P = .02). This corresponded to sensitivities of 79% (41/52; 95% CI, 66%-88%) vs 85% (56/66; 95% CI, 74%-92%) (P = .47) and 94% (62/66; 95% CI, 85%-98%) (P = .02). Thoracotomy was unnecessary in 21 patients (18%; 95% CI, 12%-26%) in the mediastinoscopy group vs 9 (7%; 95% CI, 4%-13%) in the endosonography group (P = .02). The complication rate was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with (suspected) NSCLC, a staging strategy combining endosonography and surgical staging compared with surgical staging alone resulted in greater sensitivity for mediastinal nodal metastases and fewer unnecessary thoracotomies.

"Chlamydia trachomatis and risk of prevalent and incident cervical premalignancy in a population-based cohort. BACKGROUND: Cofactors might affect the risk of the rare progression from infection with carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) to cervical premalignancy to invasive cancer. Some studies have observed that Chlamydia trachomatis infection is associated with increased risk for cervical cancer. In a large prospective cohort, we assessed the role of C trachomatis in cervical premalignancy and addressed confounding by HPV. METHODS: We identified 182 women with prevalent and 132 women with incident histological cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2), grade 3 (CIN3), or cervical cancer (CIN2+) in the Costa Rica HPV Natural History Study. Control subjects were 995 (approximately 10% of the 10 049) subjects who were randomly selected from the same study. Cervical HPV status at enrollment was determined by MY09/MY11 polymerase chain reaction amplification and dot-blot hybridization. The presence of C trachomatis DNA in cervical exfoliated cells at enrollment was determined by a novel serovar-specific polymerase chain reaction-based C trachomatis detection and genotyping assay. Plasma drawn at enrollment from each subject was used to determine C trachomatis immunoglobulin G (IgG) status. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between C trachomatis and CIN2+, taking into account possible confounding by HPV. RESULTS: C trachomatis positivity at enrollment was associated with CIN2+ and concurrent and subsequent carcinogenic HPV infection. To account for confounding by HPV status, we restricted the analysis to women positive for carcinogenic HPV DNA at enrollment and found no association between C trachomatis status (as assessed by DNA or IgG) at enrollment and combined prevalent and/or incident CIN2+ (for C trachomatis DNA positivity, odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval = 0.42 to 1.41; for C trachomatis seropositivity, odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 0.85 to 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between C trachomatis status, as assessed by DNA or IgG, and risk of cervical premalignancy, after controlling for carcinogenic HPV-positive status. Previous positive associations between C trachomatis and cervical premalignancy could have been caused, in part, by an increased susceptibility to HPV infection.",cancer
"The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets and colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND: Although the Mediterranean diet has been studied for cancer mortality and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet shares similarities with the Mediterranean diet, few studies have specifically examined these 2 diets and incident colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to prospectively assess the association between the Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMed) and the DASH-style diet scores and risk of colorectal cancer in middle-aged men and women. DESIGN: A total of 87,256 women and 45,490 men (age 30-55 y for women and 40-75 y for men at baseline) without a history of cancer were followed for </= 26 y. The aMed and DASH scores were calculated for each participant by using dietary information that was assessed </= 7 times during follow-up. Relative risks (RRs) for colorectal cancer were computed with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: We documented 1432 cases of incident colorectal cancer among women and 1032 cases in men. Comparing top with bottom quintiles of the DASH score, the pooled RR for total colorectal cancer was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.91; P for trend = 0.0001). The corresponding RR for DASH score and colon cancer was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.95; P for trend = 0.002). There was a suggestion of an inverse association with rectal cancer with a pooled RR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.98; P for trend = 0.31) when comparing top with bottom quintiles of DASH score. No association was observed with aMed score. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the DASH diet (which involves higher intakes of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables; moderate amounts of low-fat dairy; and lower amounts of red or processed meats, desserts, and sweetened beverages) was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Major urologic problems in geriatrics: assessment and management. Elderly urologic patients require the same cautions as used in development of treatment programs for them in other disciplines. Because of potential interference with poor renal function or crossover effects with central or peripheral nervous system, however, many urologic drugs must be titrated appropriately. In treating cancer, erectile dysfunction, incontinence or urinary infection, patient quality of life and life span become dominant factors in making therapeutic decisions, by behavioral change, medication, or surgical intervention.",cancer
"Use and assessment of PSA in prostate cancer. Since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the late 1980s, more prostate cancers have been detected, and at an earlier stage. As a consequence, the majority of prostate cancers are now detected years before the emergence of clinically evident disease, which usually represents locally advanced or metastatic cancer. PSA screening has remained controversial, because many of the prostate cancers detected are low grade and slow growing. With this long natural history and a median survival without treatment that often approaches at least 15 to 20 years, many clinicians and researchers have questioned if prostate cancer screening and treatment actually improves survival, as many patients will die with prostate cancer rather than of prostate cancer. In this review, the authors discuss the rationale for prostate cancer screening and present the current guidelines for the use of PSA.",cancer
"Evaluation and management of the renal mass. The evaluation and management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has evolved in recent decades in response to the changing clinical presentation of the disease. Traditional teaching suggested that RCC usually presents with signs or symptoms. However, RCC discovered this way was usually locally advanced and often metastatic, requiring radical nephrectomy in most cases but often having a poor prognosis. As contemporary general medical practice began routinely using axial body imaging in the evaluation of many nonspecific abdominal complaints, today more than 70% of RCC cases identified are ""screen-detected"" as incidental findings having no attributable symptoms. This change has prompted a significant RCC stage migration over the past 20 years, with most kidney tumors seen in 2010 being smaller, organ-confined, and appropriate for nephron-sparing approaches with the anticipation of a favorable outcome. The approach to addressing patients with these incidentally detected, often localized, small renal masses raises different concerns than those for traditional patients presenting with symptomatic RCC. This article reviews the modern epidemiology of RCC, outlines the components of the evaluation of the incidental renal mass, details the current options of management, and discusses the long-term expectations for these patients.",cancer
"Cavernous hemangioma of the orbital apex: pathogenetic considerations in surgical management. PURPOSE: To consider the pathogenesis and growth of cavernous hemangioma, particularly within the crowded orbital apex, in decisions regarding surgical indications, timing, and technique. DESIGN: A perspective based on analysis of the microanatomic relationships and growth potential of apical cavernous hemangiomas, with representative case studies illustrating management recommendations. METHODS: Analysis of microscopic findings in typical and vision-loss cases; review of tumor growth patterns as reported in observational and interventional studies; consideration of surgical approaches and reported functional outcomes. RESULTS: An ongoing, local hemodynamic imbalance may drive the proliferation of a cavernous hemangioma. Extension into neighboring tissue induces a fibrous capsule, which is continually reconstituted as the lesion expands, and which may incorporate visually critical structures in the confines of the apex. The extent of this microanatomic intimacy is not detectable preoperatively. The tumor's remaining growth potential at the time of diagnosis or following incomplete resection is not predictable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients without significant vision deficits should be observed for progression. Those with significant deficits or signs of progression should be offered timely surgery, with recognition of the risks. The surgical approach should be individualized based on macroanatomic relationships. The decision to intervene should not be a commitment to complete resection at any cost; intraoperative recognition of ""inoperable"" attachments may dictate modifications in order to preserve vision.",cancer
"Differentiation of vascular tumors from vascular malformations by expression of Wilms tumor 1 gene: evaluation of 126 cases. BACKGROUND: Vascular tumors and malformations can be challenging to diagnose. Although they may initially appear very similar, they have distinct clinical courses and management. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene expression has been reported in many different tumors including hematologic malignancies and some solid tumors. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the expression of WT1 in 126 vascular lesions (64 vascular tumors, one Masson tumor, and 61 vascular malformations). METHODS: Based on the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification of vascular anomalies, we studied the expression of WT1 in vascular tumors composed of infantile hemangioma, congenital hemangiomas (non-involuting, rapidly involuting, and not otherwise specified), pyogenic granuloma, tufted angioma, cherry angioma, Kaposi sarcoma, and angiosarcoma. We also studied WT1 expression in vascular malformations composed of angiokeratoma/verrucous hemangioma, combined vascular malformations, venous malformations, glomuvenous malformations, lymphatic malformations/lymphangioma, telangiectasia, and targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma. RESULTS: All vascular tumors and proliferations had positive WT1 cytoplasmic endothelial immunostaining whereas only 3 vascular malformations were WT1 positive. Moreover the positivity of WT1 in these vascular malformations was focal and involved only re-endothelialized neovessels within thrombi. LIMITATIONS: The low number of malignant vascular tumors is a limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical detection of WT1 could be a useful tool to routine evaluation of vascular anomalies allowing the distinction of vascular tumors and proliferations from vascular malformations. Staining for WT1 may guide the clinician in difficult cases, as positive results would suggest a proliferative vascular lesion whereas negative results might point to a vascular malformation.",cancer
"Impact of prolonged fraction delivery times simulating IMRT on cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell killing. PURPOSE: To determine the impact of prolonged fraction delivery times (FDTs) simulating intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell killing. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Cultured NPC cell lines CNE1 and CNE2 were used in this study. The biological effectiveness of fractionated irradiation protocols simulating conventional external beam radiotherapy and IMRT (FDT of 15, 36, and 50 minutes) was estimated with standard colony assay, and the differences in cell surviving fractions after irradiation with different protocols were tested by use of the paired t test. The impact degree of prolonged FDTs (from 8 to 50 minutes) on cell killing was also assessed by the dose-modifying factors, which were estimated by comparing the effectiveness of intermittently delivered 2 Gy with that of continuously delivered 1.5 to 2 Gy. RESULTS: The cell surviving fractions of both CNE1 and CNE2 after fractionated irradiation simulating IMRT were higher than those simulating conventional external beam radiotherapy (p < 0.05). The dose-modifying factors for a fraction dose of 2 Gy increased from 1.05 to 1.18 for CNE1 and from 1.05 to 1.11 for CNE2 with the FDT being prolonged from 15 to 50 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the prolonged FDTs simulating IMRT significantly decreased the cell killing in both CNE1 and CNE2 cell lines, and these negative effects increased with the FDT being prolonged from 15 to 50 minutes. These effects, if confirmed by in vivo and clinical studies, need to be considered in designing IMRT treatments for NPC.",cancer
"Case series. Soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot. BACKGROUND: We reviewed cases of soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot to gain insight into the presentation, treatments and outcomes for this rare disease and to determine whether limb-salvage surgery yields reasonable functional and oncological outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the cases of 16 patients treated by 2 of us (R.T. and M.I.) for soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot over a 15-year period. We extracted the following information from each patient's medical record: disease status at presentation, prior treatment, histological diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, details of treatment, oncological outcome and functional outcome. Functional outcome was assessed with the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) and the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS 1987). RESULTS: Follow-up averaged 6 (range 2-15) years. Eight patients presented after unplanned excision. Histological diagnosis was synovial sarcoma for 7 of 16 patients.The tumours were evenly distributed among the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot. Most patients (n = 13) presented with AJCC stage II or III disease. Amputation was necessary for 3 patients, whereas limb salvage was possible for the other 13. Free tissue transfer (n = 9) and radiation therapy (n = 12) were used in most cases. Surgical margins were microscopically positive in 4 of the 13 patients treated with limb salvage.Local disease recurred in 2 patients. Lung metastases occurred in 4 patients. At last follow-up, 11 of 16 patients were alive without disease, 2 with disease and 3 had died of their disease. Functional assessment with MSTS 1987 and the TESS averaged 28%and 90%, respectively, after limb salvage. CONCLUSION: In this series, we found that, first, patients frequently presented after unplanned excision, and this may have led to worse oncological outcomes compared with patients who presented primarily. Second, limb salvage was usually possible, but it required accepting marginal resections, relying on free tissue transfer to obtain coverage and using radiation therapy to obtain local control. Third, this combination yielded an acceptable local control rate and very good functional outcomes.",cancer
"Management of primary rectal cancer by surgeons in Atlantic Canada: results of a regional survey. BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the current practice patterns of general surgeons in Atlantic Canada in the management of primary rectal cancer in relation to surgeon-specific variables. METHODS: We sent mail-out surveys to all practising general surgeons (n = 183) in Atlantic Canada to determine screening preferences, preoperative assessment, the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, surgical therapy for rectal cancer and surgeon demographics. We analyzed the responses using chi(2) tests. RESULTS: The response rate was 98 (54%) after 2 mail-outs; there were 82 (49%) eligible responses. Surgeons in practice for 21 years or more were more likely than those with fewer than 21 years of practice to order preoperative ultrasonography of the liver and were less likely to order preoperative computed tomography. Endorectal ultrasonography was ordered routinely by 23% of surgeons, whereas 71% of surgeons would order it if time and resources were available. Surgeons who were not certified by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada were significantly more likely than those who were certified to use neoadjuvant therapy in all patients with rectal cancer (43% v. 12%; p = 0.031). Surgeons who performed more than 10 rectal cancer surgeries per year were significantly more likely than those who performed 10 or fewer surgeries per year to use neoadjuvant treatment for T3 tumours (94% v. 61%; p = 0.007). Surgeons with medical or radiation oncology services in their communities were significantly more likely than those without such services to recommend neoadjuvant treatment in T3 rectal tumours and rectal tumours with pathologic lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: We found significant variation in the management of rectal cancer depending on surgeon-specific variables. The implications of these differences on the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer are unknown.",cancer
"Effectiveness of voice rehabilitation on vocalisation in postlaryngectomy patients: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasia of the head and neck. Its incidence has been increasing steadily all over the world. Many patients will undergo total laryngectomy with or without radical neck dissection after being diagnosed. After this surgery, normal speech is lost, and a permanent stoma in the middle of the neck is left. Therefore, voice rehabilitation is one of the most difficult challenges that these patients must overcome. In order to support the patients, otolaryngologists, nursing specialists and speech pathologists have explored several different methods for voice rehabilitation. Variations exist on the approaches of rehabilitation and indicators selected to measure the effectiveness. There is a need to undertake a systematic review to provide a plan of care and ascertain the effectiveness regarding different voice rehabilitation programs for postlaryngectomy patients. REVIEW OBJECTIVE: To critically analyse the literature and present the best available evidence related to the effectiveness of voice rehabilitation program on postlaryngectomy patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was utilised. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases was undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract to identify the optimal index terms. A second extensive search using all identified key words and index terms was then undertaken. Third, the reference list and bibliographies of all identified reports and articles were searched for additional studies. The measurement index included voice intelligibility, volume, clarity, quality of voice, patients' satisfaction, quality of life, etc. The search included reports in English and Chinese. SELECTION CRITERIA: The review considered any randomised controlled trials that addressed voice rehabilitation methods in postlaryngectomy patients. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, other quantitative research designs, such as non-randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and case-controlled studies, were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Full copies of articles considered to meet the inclusion criteria were obtained for critical appraisal by two reviewers using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Program) and McMaster scales. We utilised the 60% fulfilling of the evaluation scale items as the cut-off point and articles with a quality score less than 60% were excluded. Details of eligible trials were extracted and summarised by two reviewers independently using standardised data extraction tools developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were included in the review (Appendix I). Different voice rehabilitation methods for laryngectomees were investigated in the included studies including oesophageal voice, electrolarynx voice and surgical voice restoration. One cohort studies, five prospective studies, five retrospective studies and 11 descriptive studies were included. Because of the heterogeneity of included studies, meta-analysis was not possible. Therefore, the results were presented in narrative summary. The following main findings were identified: 1 At present, oesophageal speech, electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal were the commonly used voice rehabilitation methods with total laryngectomy patients. 2 Among these three methods, the success rate of electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal is much higher than oesophageal speech. 3 The intelligibility and speech quality of electrolarynx was lower than tracheoesophageal. 4 Patient satisfaction and self-assessed quality of life was better in tracheoesophageal group. 5 The objective index was similar between excellent tracheoesophageal and oesophageal speech patients. Conclusion 1 Electrolarynx is the easiest vocal rehabilitation method for total laryngectomy patients to use as it requires little training and does not limit the patients. But patients' satisfaction was lower because of the mechanical voice and noise. 2 Oesophageal speech is the hardest vocal rehabilitation method to learn. It needs a long period of time to practise and requires the patient to be in good physical condition and to be relatively young. The success rate was relatively lower; however, it is the most commonly used rehabilitation method in developing countries because of low cost. 3 Tracheoesophageal is the most commonly used voice rehabilitation method in developed countries. It is a surgical method that could be performed as either a primary procedure or secondary procedure. Reported patient quality of life and satisfaction following tracheoesophageal were the best; however, there are complications and the frequent replacement of the prostheses is an important problem yet to be solved. Implication for practice 1 Voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy is an immediate and long-term problem that patients and health worker must face. 2 Healthcare workers should understand the advantages and disadvantages of each voice rehabilitation method in detail to assist people with total laryngectomy to make the most appropriate decision in regard to rehabilitation method taking into consideration their age, sex, physical condition, job, economic status and other context factors. Implication for research 1 Further high-quality studies comparing the effectiveness of oesophageal speech, electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal vocal rehabilitation methods are needed, especially with the subjective and objective outcome index concurrently. 2 Further investigation is required to identify strategies to decrease the complications of tracheoesophageal and reduce frequency of required tracheoesophageal replacement. 3 More research is needed in the context of developing countries where healthcare resources may be limited.",cancer
"Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy treated by surgery. A case report and the review of the literature. INTRODUCTION: Prenatal diagnosis of pheocromocytoma, although rare, is important as it allows a reduction in both maternal mortality and foetal loss. Pheocromocytoma operated on in the first trimester of pregnancy with survival of both patient and foetus is rare in literature. Our case was operated on with success after a correct and early diagnosis was obtained despite a chronic hypertension which existed long before pregnancy. Our case study well illustrates that a correct multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinologists, anesthesiologists, surgeons and gynecologists is fundamental for a positive outcome. CASE REPORT: The case of a white caucasian pregnant woman at 13th weeks of gestation with pheocromocytoma and severe and unstable hypertension that could not be pharmacologically controlled is described. Morphological diagnosis was safely obtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) without intravenous medium contrast agent. Pre-operative treatment consisted of therapy with alpha-blockers and rehydration. Adrenalectomy was performed through a laparotomy. Postoperative treatment consisted of rehydration and ephedrine continued until the fourth post-operative day. The post-operative period was uneventful and a new ultrasound (US) scan confirmed foetal vitality. The patient was discharged seven days after surgery. A live newborn was physiologically delivered after a nine-month pregnancy. CONCLUSION: A correct diagnosis in all pregnant women with severe hypertension particularly those not screened for secondary hypertension and a multidisciplinary management are mandatory to obtain optimal results and avoid deleterious effects at delivery.",cancer
"Single port laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy with the TriPort system. A case report and review of the literature. AIM: We report our recent experience with the TriPort system (trademark of Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) to perform a laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy via a single periumbilical incision. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old multiparous woman was referred to us on March 2009 because of menometrorrhagia and uterine fibroids. RESULTS: The procedure was performed without intraoperative complications. The weight of the uterus was 360 gr. At the 10 months follow-up the patient did not refer any problem. DISCUSSION: Although our experience represented a potentially difficult surgery because of the size of the uterus, severe adhesions (two previous caesarean sessions) and the lack of experience with the new system, the procedure demonstrated to be feasible. As for our knowledge the present report represents the first case of single port laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy performed with the TriPort system in Italy. CONCLUSION: Single port laparoscopy is feasible and could potentially decrease postoperative pain as well as increase patient satisfaction. Although the early experience with TriPort system is promising, experienced laparoscopic skills are essential for the safe and effective performing of the procedure.",cancer
"Pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula causing caval stenosis, left renal vein thrombosis, subcutaneous fat necrosis, arthritis and dysfibrinogenemia. AIM: We describe the case of a 38 year old man, with a story of alcohol abuse, who developed a very painful nodular subcutaneous fat necrosis, fever and polyarthritis, denying any abdominal symptoms due to a pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula. MATERIAL OF STUDY: The authors discuss the unusual and protracted course with intermittent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia related to clinical manifestations such as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, pleural effusion and dysfibrinogenemia, and vascular complications as inferior vena cava stenosis and left renal vein thrombosis without abdominal symptomatology. RESULTS: After ultrasonograms and CT Scans showing a 3-4 cm cyst at the pancreatic head with a solid bud protruding into the pseudocystic cavity, and an ERCP showing a communication between the pancreatic duct and the pseudocyst but failing in demonstrating the vascular fistula, the patient underwent a Roux-en-y pseudocyst-jejunostomy and suture of the caval communication leading to complete recovery with normalization of laboratory findings. DISCUSSION: In our case, the locally sclerosing activity of the enzymes in the endothelium led to a communication between the inferior vena cava and the pseudocyst and to a complete thrombosis of the left renal vein and to a stenosis of the inferior vena cava itself The fluctuance of the symptomatology severity was probably due to an intermittent opening of the passage between pseudocyst and vena cava. Such a clinical case, to the author knowledge, has never been reported. CONCLUSION: When in presence of very high levels of amylasemia and lipasemia in spite of the paucity of abdominal symptomatology, and the onset of unusual complications such as panniculitis, pleural effusion, arthritis and coagulative disorders, a pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula should be kept in consideration during diagnosis.",cancer
"Novel multitargeted anticancer oral therapies: sunitinib and sorafenib as a paradigm. The introduction of novel targeted therapies into the clinic in recent years has had a considerable impact on the management of several neoplastic diseases--such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hepatocellular carcinomas and renal cell carcinomas--considered until recently refractory to systemic therapies. We describe here two such novel biological agents, sunitinib and sorafenib, as a paradigm of the successful clinical application of new concepts. Sunitinib and sorafenib are small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, C-Kit and others. Both agents are administered orally; sunitinib is tyically given in cycles for 4 consecutive weeks with 2 weeks off, while sorafenib is given continually. Side effects occur in most patients, similar for both agents; they may affect several systems and organs but are mostly mild and easily manageable, rarely requiring discontinuation of the drug. However, these toxicities mandate prompt attention and intervention. The most frequently observed effects are hypertension, nausea, anorexia, asthenia and cutaneous manifestations; cardiac abnormalities may include congestive failure. Sunitinib, and markedly less frequently sorafenib, may cause thyroid gland dysfunction, mainly hypothyroidism. Antitumor activity has been shown for renal cell carcinoma in pivotal trials, for sunitinib as first-line treatment and for sorafenib in previously treated patients as second-line. Sunitinib is now approved as second-line therapy for patients with GIST refractory to imatinib; sorafenib has resulted in a significant prolongation in median survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Ongoing clinical trials will further define the spectrum of these agents' antitumor activity, their role in combination with other drugs, as well as their optimal dose and schedule of administration.",cancer
"Investigation of the eIF2alpha phosphorylation mechanism in response to proteasome inhibition in melanoma and breast cancer cells. The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex found in all eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and some eubacteria. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes pleiotropic effects in cells, including cellular apoptosis, a fact that has led to the use of the 26S proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, for treatment of the multiple myeloma cancer. We previously showed that in addition to the effects of proteolysis, inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes a rapid decrease in the protein synthesis rate due to phosphorylating alfa subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) by the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI). In order to test whether inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes the same effect in cancer cells, we have investigated the influence of two commonly used proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and MG132, on the phosphorylation status of eIF2alpha in B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer cells. It was found that both of the inhibitors caused rapid phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Taking into account that the Hsp70 is a critical component needed for the HRI activation and enzymatic activity, we have tested a possible participation of this protein in the eIF2alpha phosphorylation event. However, treatment of the cells with two structurally different Hsp70 inhibitors, quercetin and KNK437, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors did not affect the eIF2alpha phosphorylation. In addition, neither protein kinase C (PKC) nor p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was required for the proteasome inhibitor-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation; futhermore, both the PKC inhibitor staurosporine and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 caused enchanced phosphorylation of eLF2alpha. Zinc (II) protoporphyrine IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of the heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which has also been previously reported to be involved in HRI activation, also failed to prevent the induction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or MG132.",cancer
"A holistic approach to a rare pathology. A case of cystic hygroma (CH), a congenital lymph-filled multicystic hamartoma of the neck, with a holistic approach to patient management is presented. The stigma of the CH imposed by attending physicians, dentists, parents, teachers and peers affected the psychological development of this patient since her diagnosis in childhood. Although surgery relieves the threat of airway obstruction and may improve the esthetic appearance of the CH, the patient may be isolated and traumatized by the ignorance and superstitions of the individuals she encounters on a daily basis.",cancer
"A new fast and fully automated software based algorithm for extracting respiratory signal from raw PET data and its comparison to other methods. PURPOSE: Respiratory gating in PET is an approach used to minimize the negative effects of respiratory motion on spatial resolution. It is based on an initial determination of a patient's respiratory movements during a scan, typically using hardware based systems. In recent years, several fully automated databased algorithms have been presented for extracting a respiratory signal directly from PET data, providing a very practical strategy for implementing gating in the clinic. In this work, a new method is presented for extracting a respiratory signal from raw PET sinogram data and compared to previously presented automated techniques. METHODS: The acquisition of respiratory signal from PET data in the newly proposed method is based on rebinning the sinogram data into smaller data structures and then analyzing the time activity behavior in the elements of these structures. From this analysis, a 1D respiratory trace is produced, analogous to a hardware derived respiratory trace. To assess the accuracy of this fully automated method, respiratory signal was extracted from a collection of 22 clinical FDG-PET scans using this method, and compared to signal derived from several other software based methods as well as a signal derived from a hardware system. RESULTS: The method presented required approximately 9 min of processing time for each 10 min scan (using a single 2.67 GHz processor), which in theory can be accomplished while the scan is being acquired and therefore allowing a real-time respiratory signal acquisition. Using the mean correlation between the software based and hardware based respiratory traces, the optimal parameters were determined for the presented algorithm. The mean/median/range of correlations for the set of scans when using the optimal parameters was found to be 0.58/0.68/0.07-0.86. The speed of this method was within the range of real-time while the accuracy surpassed the most accurate of the previously presented algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: PET data inherently contains information about patient motion; information that is not currently being utilized. We have shown that a respiratory signal can be extracted from raw PET data in potentially real-time and in a fully automated manner. This signal correlates well with hardware based signal for a large percentage of scans, and avoids the efforts and complications associated with hardware. The proposed method to extract a respiratory signal can be implemented on existing scanners and, if properly integrated, can be applied without changes to routine clinical procedures.",cancer
"Measuring output factors of small fields formed by collimator jaws and multileaf collimator using plastic scintillation detectors. PURPOSE: As the practice of using high-energy photon beams to create therapeutic radiation fields of subcentimeter dimensions (as in intensity-modulated radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery) grows, so too does the need for accurate verification of beam output at these small fields in which standard practices of dose verification break down. This study investigates small-field output factors measured using a small plastic scintillation detector (PSD), as well as a 0.01 cm3 ionization chamber. Specifically, output factors were measured with both detectors using small fields that were defined by either the X-Y collimator jaws or the multileaf collimator (MLC). METHODS: A PSD of 0.5 mm diameter and 2 mm length was irradiated with 6 and 18 MV linac beams. The PSD was positioned vertically at a source-to-axis distance of 100 cm, at 10 cm depth in a water phantom, and irradiated with fields ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.5 to 10 x 10 cm2. The field sizes were defined either by the collimator jaws alone or by a MLC alone. The MLC fields were constructed in two ways: with the closed leaves (i.e., those leaves that were not opened to define the square field) meeting at either the field center line or at a 4 cm offset from the center line. Scintillation light was recorded using a CCD camera and an estimation of error in the median-filtered signals was made using the bootstrapping technique. Measurements were made using a CC01 ionization chamber under conditions identical to those used for the PSD. RESULTS: Output factors measured by the PSD showed close agreement with those measured using the ionization chamber for field sizes of 2.0 x 2.0 cm2 and above. At smaller field sizes, the PSD obtained output factors as much as 15% higher than those found using the ionization chamber by 0.6 x 0.6 cm2 jaw-defined fields. Output factors measured with no offset of the closed MLC leaves were as much as 20% higher than those measured using a 4 cm leaf offset. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that PSDs provide a useful and possibly superior alternative to existing dosimetry systems for small fields, as they are inherently less susceptible to volume-averaging and perturbation effects than larger, air-filled ionization chambers. Therefore, PSDs may provide more accurate small-field output factor determination, regardless of the collimation mechanism.",cancer
"Surface applicator calibration and commissioning of an electronic brachytherapy system for nonmelanoma skin cancer treatment. PURPOSE: The Xoft Axxent x-ray source has been used for treating nonmelanoma skin cancer since the surface applicators became clinically available in 2009. The authors report comprehensive calibration procedures for the electronic brachytherapy (eBx) system with the surface applicators. METHODS: The Xoft miniature tube (model S700) generates 50 kVp low-energy x rays. The new surface applicators are available in four sizes of 10, 20, 35, and 50 mm in diameter. The authors' tests include measurements of dose rate, air-gap factor, output stability, depth dose verification, beam flatness and symmetry, and treatment planning with patient specific cutout factors. The TG-61 in-air method was used as a guideline for acquiring nominal dose-rate output at the skin surface. A soft x-ray parallel-plate chamber (PTW T34013) and electrometer was used for the output commissioning. GafChromic EBT films were used for testing the properties of the treatment fields with the skin applicators. Solid water slabs were used to verify the depth dose and cutout factors. Patients with basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma were treated with eBx using a calibrated Xoft system with the low-energy x-ray source and the skin applicators. RESULTS: The average nominal dose-rate output at the skin surface for the 35 mm applicator is 1.35 Gy/min with +/- 5% variation for 16 sources. The dose-rate output and stability (within +/- 5% variation) were also measured for the remaining three applicators. For the same source, the output variation is within 2%. The effective source-surface distance was calculated based on the air-gap measurements for four applicator sizes. The field flatness and symmetry are well within 5%. Percentage depth dose in water was provided by factory measurements and can be verified using solid water slabs. Treatment duration was calculated based on the nominal dose rate, the prescription fraction size, the depth dose percentage, and the cutout factor. The output factor needs to be measured for each case with varying shapes of cutouts. CONCLUSIONS: Together with TG-61, the authors' methodology provides comprehensive calibration procedures for medical physicists for using the Xoft eBx system and skin applicators for nonmelanoma skin cancer treatments.",cancer
"Monte Carlo evaluation of scatter mitigation strategies in cone-beam CT. PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of two widely used scatter mitigation methods: antiscatter grids (ASGs) and beam modulating with bowtie filters (BTFs), in combination with subtractive scatter correction or zeroth order normalization phantom calibration, for improving image noise, contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and image uniformity for on-board cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging systems used for image-guided radiation therapy. METHODS: PTRAN Monte Carlo CBCT x-ray projections of head and pelvic phantoms were calculated for combinations of beam-modulation and scatter rejection methods and images were reconstructed by in-house developed software. In addition, a simple one-dimensional analytic model was developed to predict scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) and CNR as a function of cylindrical phantom thickness, ASG transmission, and beam modulation with bow-tie filters. RESULTS: ASGs were found to have slightly negative or no effect on head phantom image CNR and to modestly improve CNR (10%-20%) in pelvic phantom images. However, scatter subtraction and norm-phantom calibration perform better when applied on data acquired with ASGs. Scatter subtraction improves CT number accuracy, but increases noise, and in high SPR/low primary-photon transmission scenarios can dramatically reduce CNR and introduce streaking artifacts. The BTF is found to reduce SPR and image noise, resulting in a better trade-off between CNR and imaging dose, but introduces a circular band artifact. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ASGs have a modest positive impact in pelvic scans and negative in head scans, scatter subtraction improves the HU accuracy but reduces CNR, while BTF has a clearly positive effect.",cancer
"Model-based calculations of off-axis ratio of conic beams for a dedicated 6 MV radiosurgery unit. PURPOSE: Because the small-radius photon beams shaped by cones in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) lack lateral electronic equilibrium and a detector's finite cross section, direct experimental measurement of dosimetric data for these beams can be subject to large uncertainties. As the dose calculation accuracy of a treatment planning system largely depends on how well the dosimetric data are measured during the machine's commissioning, there is a critical need for an independent method to validate measured results. Therefore, the authors studied the model-based calculation as an approach to validate measured off-axis ratios (OARs). METHODS: The authors previously used a two-component analytical model to calculate central axis dose and associated dosimetric data (e.g., scatter factors and tissue-maximum ratio) in a water phantom and found excellent agreement between the calculated and the measured central axis doses for small 6 MV SRS conic beams. The model was based on that of Nizin and Mooij [""An approximation of central-axis absorbed dose in narrow photon beams,"" Med. Phys. 24, 1775-1780 (1997)] but was extended to account for apparent attenuation, spectral differences between broad and narrow beams, and the need for stricter scatter dose calculations for clinical beams. In this study, the authors applied Clarkson integration to this model to calculate OARs for conic beams. OARs were calculated for selected cones with radii from 0.2 to 1.0 cm. To allow comparisons, the authors also directly measured OARs using stereotactic diode (SFD), microchamber, and film dosimetry techniques. The calculated results were machine-specific and independent of direct measurement data for these beams. RESULTS: For these conic beams, the calculated OARs were in excellent agreement with the data measured using an SFD. The discrepancies in radii and in 80%-20% penumbra were within 0.01 cm, respectively. Using SFD-measured OARs as the reference data, the authors found that the calculated OARs were more accurate than those measured with a microchamber or film dosimetry. CONCLUSIONS: The model produces sufficiently accurate conic beam dosimetric data that can be used to validate direct measurement results for such beams.",cancer
"Characterization of a real-time surface image-guided stereotactic positioning system. PURPOSE: The AlignRT3C system is an image-guided stereotactic positioning system (IGSPS) that provides real-time target localization. This study involves the first use of this system with three camera pods. The authors have evaluated its localization accuracy and tracking ability using a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) system and an optical tracking system in a clinical setting. METHODS: A modified Rando head-and-neck phantom and five patients receiving intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) were used to evaluate the calibration, registration, and position-tracking accuracies of the AlignRT3C system and to study surface reconstruction uncertainties, including the effects due to interfractional and intrafractional motion, skin tone, room light level, camera temperature, and image registration region of interest selection. System accuracy was validated through comparison with the Elekta kV CBCT system (XVI) and the Varian frameless SonArray (FSA) optical tracking system. Surface-image data sets were acquired with the AlignRT3C daily for the evaluation of pretreatment and interfractional and intrafractional motion for each patient. Results for two different reference image sets, planning CT surface contours (CTS) and previously recorded AlignRT3C optical surface images (ARTS), are reported. RESULTS: The system origin displacements for the AlignRT3C and XVI systems agreed to within 1.3 mm and 0.7 degrees. Similar results were seen for AlignRT3C vs FSA. For the phantom displacements having couch angles of 0 degrees, those that utilized ART_S references resulted in a mean difference of 0.9 mm/0.4 degrees with respect to XVI and 0.3 mm/0.2 degrees with respect to FSA. For phantom displacements of more than +/- 10 mm and +/- 3 degrees, the maximum discrepancies between AlignRT and the XVI and FSA systems were 3.0 and 0.4 mm, respectively. For couch angles up to +/- 90 degrees, the mean (max.) difference between the AlignRT3C and FSA was 1.2 (2.3) mm/0.7 degrees (1.2 degrees). For all tests, the mean registration errors obtained using the CT_S references were approximately 1.3 mm/1.0 degrees larger than those obtained using the ART_S references. For the patient study, the mean differences in the pretreatment displacements were 0.3 mm/0.2 degrees between the AlignRT3C and XVI systems and 1.3 mm/1 degrees between the FSA and XVI systems. For noncoplanar treatments, interfractional motion displacements obtained using the ART_S and CT_S references resulted in 90th percentile differences within 2.1 mm/0.8 degrees and 3.3 mm/0.3 degrees, respectively, compared to the FSA system. Intrafractional displacements that were tracked for a maximum of 14 min were within 1 mm/1 degrees of those obtained with the FSA system. Uncertainties introduced by the bite-tray were as high as 3 mm/2 degrees for one patient. The combination of gantry, aSi detector panel, and x-ray tube blockage effects during the CBCT acquisition resulted in a registration error of approximately 3 mm. No skin-tone or surface deformation effects were seen with the limited patient sample. CONCLUSIONS: AlignRT3C can be used as a nonionizing IGSPS with accuracy comparable to current image/marker-based systems. IGSPS and CBCT can be combined for high-precision positioning without the need for patient-attached localization devices.",cancer
"Direct measurement of instantaneous source speed for a HDR brachytherapy unit using an optical fiber based detector. PURPOSE: Several attempts to determine the transit time of a high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy unit have been reported in the literature with controversial results. The determination of the source speed is necessary to accurately calculate the transient dose in brachytherapy treatments. In these studies, only the average speed of the source was measured as a parameter for transit dose calculation, which does not account for the realistic movement of the source, and is therefore inaccurate for numerical simulations. The purpose of this work is to report the implementation and technical design of an optical fiber based detector to directly measure the instantaneous speed profile of a 192Ir source in a Nucletron HDR brachytherapy unit. METHODS: To accomplish this task, we have developed a setup that uses the Cerenkov light induced in optical fibers as a detection signal for the radiation source moving inside the HDR catheter. As the 192Ir source travels between two optical fibers with known distance, the threshold of the induced signals are used to extract the transit time and thus the velocity. The high resolution of the detector enables the measurement of the transit time at short separation distance of the fibers, providing the instantaneous speed. RESULTS: Accurate and high resolution speed profiles of the 192Ir radiation source traveling from the safe to the end of the catheter and between dwell positions are presented. The maximum and minimum velocities of the source were found to be 52.0 +/- 1.0 and 17.3 +/- 1.2 cm/s. The authors demonstrate that the radiation source follows a uniformly accelerated linear motion with acceleration of [a] = 113 cm/s2. In addition, the authors compare the average speed measured using the optical fiber detector to those obtained in the literature, showing deviation up to 265%. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the authors directly measured for the first time the instantaneous speed profile of a radiation source in a HDR brachytherapy unit traveling from the unit safe to the end of the catheter and between interdwell distances. The method is feasible and accurate to implement on quality assurance tests and provides a unique database for efficient computational simulations of the transient dose.",cancer
"Shading correction for on-board cone-beam CT in radiation therapy using planning MDCT images. PURPOSE: Applications of cone-beam CT (CBCT) to image-guided radiationtherapy (IGRT) are hampered by shading artifacts in the reconstructed images. These artifacts are mainly due to scatter contamination in the projections but also can result from uncorrected beam hardening effects as well as nonlinearities in responses of the amorphous silicon flat panel detectors. While currently, CBCT is mainly used to provide patient geometry information for treatment setup, more demanding applications requiring high-quality CBCT images are under investigation. To tackle these challenges, many CBCT correction algorithms have been proposed; yet, a standard approach still remains unclear. In this work, we propose a shading correction method for CBCT that addresses artifacts from low-frequency projection errors. The method is consistent with the current workflow of radiation therapy. METHODS: With much smaller inherent scatter signals and more accurate detectors, diagnostic multidetector CT (MDCT) provides high quality CT images that are routinely used for radiation treatment planning. Using the MDCT image as ""free"" prior information, we first estimate the primary projections in the CBCT scan via forward projection of the spatially registered MDCT data. Since most of the CBCT shading artifacts stem from low-frequency errors in the projections such as scatter, these errors can be accurately estimated by low-pass filtering the difference between the estimated and raw CBCT projections. The error estimates are then subtracted from the raw CBCT projections. Our method is distinct from other published correction methods that use the MDCT image as a prior because it is projection-based and uses limited patient anatomical information from the MDCT image. The merit of CBCT-based treatment monitoring is therefore retained. RESULTS: The proposed method is evaluated using two phantom studies on tabletop systems. On the Catphan 600 phantom, our approach reduces the reconstruction error from 348 Hounsfield unit (HU) without correction to 4 HU around the object center after correction, and from 375 HU to 17 HU in the high-contrast regions. In the selected regions of interest (ROIs), the average image contrast is increased by a factor of 3.3. When noise suppression is implemented, the proposed correction substantially improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and therefore the visibility of low-contrast objects, as seen in a more challenging pelvis phantom study. Besides a significant improvement in image uniformity, a low-contrast object of approximately 25 HU, which is otherwise buried in the shading artifacts, can be clearly identified after the proposed correction due to a CNR increase of 3.1. Compared to a kernel-based scatter correction method coupled with an analytical beam hardening correction, our approach also shows an overall improved performance with some residual artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: By providing effective shading correction, our approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of more advanced CBCT-based clinical applications for IGRT, such as tumor delineation and dose calculation.",cancer
"Regularized antenna profile adaptation in online hyperthermia treatment. PURPOSE: Online optimization of annular-phased-array hyperthermia (HT) is based on planning tools and magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry. Until now, the method has been validated in phantoms. Further developments and extensions are required for clinical purposes. In particular, the problem of deducing the electric field distribution inside the patient from MR thermometry is ill-posed, which leads to an amplification of measurement errors. A method to overcome this difficulty is proposed. METHODS: The authors utilized a regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm with a fast bioheat transfer equation (BHTE) approximation to identify the field parameters. To evaluate the method, simulations with patient models are conducted and a treatment data set obtained from a heat treatment performed in the hybrid HT-MR system at the Charite Medical School is used to visualize the error amplification. RESULTS: The regularization leads to a significantly improved accuracy of the predicted electric fields and temperatures compared to an unregularized approach. The BHTE approximation enables highly accurate temperature predictions in real-time. CONCLUSIONS: Regularization proves to be necessary to identify electromagnetic field parameters. The proposed method is able to reproduce measurements without overfitting to the noise in the MR measurements and results in an improved treatment planning.",cancer
"Apparent absence of a proton beam dose rate effect and possible differences in RBE between Bragg peak and plateau. PURPOSE: Respiration-gated irradiation for a moving target requires a longer time to deliver single fraction in proton radiotherapy (PRT). Ultrahigh dose rate (UDR) proton beam, which is 10-100 times higher than that is used in current clinical practice, has been investigated to deliver daily dose in single breath hold duration. The purpose of this study is to investigate the survival curve and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of such an ultrahigh dose rate proton beam and their linear energy transfer (LET) dependence. METHODS: HSG cells were irradiated by a spatially and temporally uniform proton beam at two different dose rates: 8 Gy/min (CDR, clinical dose rate) and 325 Gy/min (UDR, ultrahigh dose rate) at the Bragg peak and 1.75 (CDR) and 114 Gy/min (UDR) at the plateau. To study LET dependence, the cells were positioned at the Bragg peak, where the absorbed dose-averaged LET was 3.19 keV/microm, and at the plateau, where it was 0.56 keV/microm. After the cell exposure and colony assay, the measured data were fitted by the linear quadratic (LQ) model and the survival curves and RBE at 10% survival were compared. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the survival curves between the two proton dose rates. The ratio of the RBE for CDR/UDR was 0.98 +/- 0.04 at the Bragg peak and 0.96 +/- 0.06 at the plateau. On the other hand, Bragg peak/plateau RBE ratio was 1.15 +/- 0.05 for UDR and 1.18 +/- 0.07 for CDR. CONCLUSIONS: Present RBE can be consistently used in treatment planning of PRT using ultrahigh dose rate radiation. Because a significant increase in RBE toward the Bragg peak was observed for both UDR and CDR, further evaluation of RBE enhancement toward the Bragg peak and beyond is required.",cancer
"Monte Carlo calculated TG-60 dosimetry parameters for the beta- emitter 153Sm brachytherapy source. PURPOSE: The formalism recommended by Task Group 60 (TG-60) of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) is applicable for beta sources. Radioactive biocompatible and biodegradable 153Sm glass seed without encapsulation is a beta- emitter radionuclide with a short half-life and delivers a high dose rate to the tumor in the millimeter range. This study presents the results of Monte Carlo calculations of the dosimetric parameters for the 153Sm brachytherapy source. METHODS: Version 5 of the (MCNP) Monte Carlo radiation transport code was used to calculate two-dimensional dose distributions around the source. The dosimetric parameters of AAPM TG-60 recommendations including the reference dose rate, the radial dose function, the anisotropy function, and the one-dimensional anisotropy function were obtained. RESULTS: The dose rate value at the reference point was estimated to be 9.21 +/- 0.6 cGy h(-1) microCi(-1). Due to the low energy beta emitted from 153Sm sources, the dose fall-off profile is sharper than the other beta emitter sources. The calculated dosimetric parameters in this study are compared to several beta and photon emitting seeds. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the advantage of the 153Sm source in comparison with the other sources because of the rapid dose fall-off of beta ray and high dose rate at the short distances of the seed. The results would be helpful in the development of the radioactive implants using 153Sm seeds for the brachytherapy treatment.",cancer
"A support vector machine (SVM) for predicting preferred treatment position in radiotherapy of patients with breast cancer. PURPOSE: NYU 05-181 protocol compared the CT simulation in both supine and prone positions for 400 patients with breast cancer (200 left-breast and 200 right-breast) to identify which setup is better at sparing heart and lung involvement in the treatment process. The results demonstrated that all right-breast patients benefited from the prone treatment position, while for left-breast patients, 85% were better treated prone and 15% were better treated supine. Using the clinical data collected from this protocol, the authors aimed at developing an automated tool capable of identifying which of the left-breast cancer patients are better treated supine without obtaining a second CT scan in the supine position. METHODS: Prone CT scans from 198 of the 200 left-breast cancer patients enrolled in NYU 05-181 protocol were deidentified and exported to a dedicated research planning workstation. Three-dimensional geometric features of the organs at risk and tumor bed were extracted. A two-stage classifier was used to classify patients into the prone class or the supine class. In the first stage, the authors use simple thresholding to divide the patients into two groups based on their in-field heart volume. For patients with in-field heart volume < or = 0.1 cc, the prone position was chosen as the preferred treatment position. Patients with in-field heart volume > 0.1 cc will be further classified in the second stage by a weighted support vector machine (SVM). The weight parameters of the SVM were adjusted to maximize the specificity [true-supine/(true-supine+false-prone)] at the cost of lowering but still maintaining reasonable sensitivity [true-prone/(true-prone+false-supine)]. The authors used K-fold cross validations to test the performance of the SVM classifier. A feature selection algorithm was also used to identify features that give the best classification performance. RESULTS: After the first stage, 49 of the 198 left-breast cancer patients were found to have > 0.1 cc of in-field heart volume. The three geometric features of heart orientation, distance between heart and tumor, and in-field lung were selected by the feature selection algorithm in the second stage of the two-stage classifier to give the best predefined weighted accuracy. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method were found to be 90.4% and 99.3%, respectively. Using two-stage classification, the authors reduced the proportion of prone-treated patients that need a second supine CT scan down to 16.3/170 or 9.6%, as compared to 21/170 or 12.4% when the authors use only the first stage (thresholding) for classification. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' study showed that a feature-based classifier is feasible for predicting the preferred treatment position, based on features extracted from prone CT scans. The two-stage classifier achieved very high specificity at an acceptable expense of sensitivity.",cancer
"Advanced treatment planning methods for efficient radiation therapy with laser accelerated proton and ion beams. PURPOSE: Laser plasma acceleration can potentially replace large and expensive cyclotrons or synchrotrons for radiotherapy with protons and ions. On the way toward a clinical implementation, various challenges such as the maximum obtainable energy still remain to be solved. In any case, laser accelerated particles exhibit differences compared to particles from conventional accelerators. They typically have a wide energy spread and the beam is extremely pulsed (i.e., quantized) due to the pulsed nature of the employed lasers. The energy spread leads to depth dose curves that do not show a pristine Bragg peak but a wide high dose area, making precise radiotherapy impossible without an additional energy selection system. Problems with the beam quantization include the limited repetition rate and the number of accelerated particles per laser shot. This number might be too low, which requires a high repetition rate, or it might be too high, which requires an additional fluence selection system to reduce the number of particles. Trying to use laser accelerated particles in a conventional way such as spot scanning leads to long treatment times and a high amount of secondary radiation produced when blocking unwanted particles. METHODS: The authors present methods of beam delivery and treatment planning that are specifically adapted to laser accelerated particles. In general, it is not necessary to fully utilize the energy selection system to create monoenergetic beams for the whole treatment plan. Instead, within wide parts of the target volume, beams with broader energy spectra can be used to simultaneously cover multiple axially adjacent spots of a conventional dose delivery grid as applied in intensity modulated particle therapy. If one laser shot produces too many particles, they can be distributed over a wider area with the help of a scattering foil and a multileaf collimator to cover multiple lateral spot positions at the same time. These methods are called axial and lateral clustering and reduce the number of particles that have to be blocked in the beam delivery system. Furthermore, the optimization routine can be adjusted to reduce the number of dose spots and laser shots. The authors implemented these methods into a research treatment planning system for laser accelerated particles. RESULTS: The authors' proposed methods can decrease the amount of secondary radiation produced when blocking particles with wrong energies or when reducing the total number of particles from one laser shot. Additionally, caused by the efficient use of the beam, the treatment time is reduced considerably. Both improvements can be achieved without extensively changing the quality of the treatment plan since conventional intensity modulated particle therapy usually includes a certain amount of unused degrees of freedom which can be used to adapt to laser specific properties. CONCLUSIONS: The advanced beam delivery and treatment planning methods reduce the need to have a perfect laser-based accelerator reproducing the properties of conventional accelerators that might not be possible without increasing treatment time and secondary radiation to the patient. The authors show how some of the differences to conventional beams can be overcome and efficiently used for radiation treatment.",cancer
"Clinical development of a failure detection-based online repositioning strategy for prostate IMRT--experiments, simulation, and dosimetry study. PURPOSE: To implement and evaluate clinic-ready adaptive imaging protocols for online patient repositioning (motion tracking) during prostate IMRT using treatment beam imaging supplemented by minimal, as-needed use of on-board kV. METHODS: The authors examine the two-step decision-making strategy: (1) Use cine-MV imaging and online-updated characterization of prostate motion to detect target motion that is potentially beyond a predefined threshold and (2) use paired MV-kV 3D localization to determine overthreshold displacement and, if needed, reposition the patient. Two levels of clinical implementation were evaluated: (1) Field-by-field based motion correction for present-day linacs and (2) instantaneous repositioning for new-generation linacs with capabilities of simultaneous MV-kV imaging and remote automatic couch control during treatment delivery. Experiments were performed on a Varian Trilogy linac in clinical mode using a 4D motion phantom programed with prostate motion trajectories taken from patient data. Dosimetric impact was examined using a 2D ion chamber array. Simulations were done for 536 trajectories from 17 patients. RESULTS: Despite the loss of marker detection efficiency caused by the MLC leaves sometimes obscuring the field at the marker's projected position on the MV imager, the field-by-field correction halved (from 23% to 10%) the mean percentage of time that target displacement exceeded a 3 mm threshold, as compared to no intervention. This was achieved at minimal cost in additional imaging (average of one MV-kV pair per two to three treatment fractions) and with a very small number of repositionings (once every four to five fractions). Also with low kV usage (approximation 2/fraction), the instantaneous repositioning approach reduced overthreshold time by more than 75% (23% to 5%) even with severe MLC blockage as often encountered in current IMRT and could reduce the overthreshold time tenfold (to < 2%) if the MLC blockage problem were relieved. The information acquired for repositioning using combined MV-kV images was found to have submillimeter accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrated with a current clinical setup that substantial reduction of adverse targeting effects of intrafraction prostate motion can be realized. The proposed adaptive imaging strategy incurs minimal imaging dose to the patient as compared to other stereoscopic imaging techniques.",cancer
"Modeling scatter-to-primary dose ratio for megavoltage photon beams. PURPOSE: A three-parameter semiempirical model for scatter-to-primary dose ratio (SPR) is proposed to fit PDD (or TPR) and S(p) beam data. The SPR formula proposed in this study is more accurate than the previously published formula utilizing two parameters, especially for lower energy megavoltage photon beams, because the effect of backscattered photons is now taken into account. METHODS: Monte Carlo (MC) calculated SPR for photon energy spectrum between 60Co and 24 MV are used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. Based on fitting the MC data, the dependence of the SPR parameters (a0, w0,d0) with the attenuation coefficients of the photon beams is obtained and they were incorporated into the authors' optimization routine. The ability of the optimization routine to fit measured clinic data is examined for photon energies ranging from 60Co to 25 MV for all major cobalt and linear accelerator manufacturers. RESULTS: The authors' model successfully fits the measured photon beam data for field size (E/3-40 cm), where E is photon energy in MV and for clinically usable depths, d(max) to 20 cm for 60Co, d(max) to 30 cm for 4 MV, and d(max) to 40 cm for 6 MV and higher photon energies. The maximum error among these fits is better than 2% for photon energies above 60Co. CONCLUSIONS: The new SPR formula, along with the optimization routine, can serve as an efficient tool for performing quality control of x-ray beam data that conforms to AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee TG40 and Therapy Physics Committee TG142 reports on beam data requirement.",cancer
"Cascaded analysis of signal and noise propagation through a heterogeneous breast model. PURPOSE: The detectability of lesions in radiographic images can be impaired by patterns caused by the surrounding anatomic structures. The presence of such patterns is often referred to as anatomic noise. Others have previously extended signal and noise propagation theory to include variable background structure as an additional noise term and used in simulations for analysis by human and ideal observers. Here, the analytic forms of the signal and noise transfer are derived to obtain an exact expression for any input random distribution and the ""power law"" filter used to generate the texture of the tissue distribution. METHODS: A cascaded analysis of propagation through a heterogeneous model is derived for x-ray projection through simulated heterogeneous backgrounds. This is achieved by considering transmission through the breast as a correlated amplification point process. The analytic forms of the cascaded analysis were compared to monoenergetic Monte Carlo simulations of x-ray propagation through power law structured backgrounds. RESULTS: As expected, it was found that although the quantum noise power component scales linearly with the x-ray signal, the anatomic noise will scale with the square of the x-ray signal. There was a good agreement between results obtained using analytic expressions for the noise power and those from Monte Carlo simulations for different background textures, random input functions, and x-ray fluence. CONCLUSIONS: Analytic equations for the signal and noise properties of heterogeneous backgrounds were derived. These may be used in direct analysis or as a tool to validate simulations in evaluating detectability.",cancer
"VMC++ validation for photon beams in the energy range of 20-1000 keV. PURPOSE: In high energy teletherapy, VMC++ is known to be a very accurate and efficient Monte Carlo (MC) code. In principle, the MC method is also a powerful dose calculation tool in other areas in radiation oncology, e.g., brachytherapy or orthovoltage radiotherapy. However, VMC++ is not validated for the low-energy range of such applications. This work aims in the validation of the VMC++ MC code for photon beams in the energy range between 20 and 1000 keV. METHODS: Dose calculations were performed in different 40 x 40 x 40 cm3 phantoms of different materials. Dose distributions of monoenergetic (ranging from 20 to 1000 keV) 10 x 10 and 2 x 2 cm2 parallel beams were calculated. Voxel sizes of 4 x 4 x 4 and 1 x 1 x 1 mm3 were used for the dose calculations. The resulting dose distributions were compared to those calculated using EGSnrc, which is used as a golden standard in this work. RESULTS: At energies between 100 and 1000 keV, EGSnrc and VMC++ calculated dose distributions agree within the statistical uncertainty of about 1% (1sigma). At energies < or = 50 keV, dose differences of up to 1.6% (in % of D(max)) occur when VMC++ and EGSnrc are compared. Turning off Rayleigh scattering, binding effects for Compton scattering, and the atomic relaxation after photoelectric absorption in EGSnrc (all not implemented in VMC++) leads to an agreement between both MC codes within statistical uncertainty. Further, using the KERMA approximation feature implemented in VMC++ leads to very efficient simulations in the energy range between 20 and 1000 keV. CONCLUSIONS: Further improvements for very low energies in accuracy of VMC++ could be achieved by implementing Rayleigh scattering, binding effects for Compton scattering, and the atomic relaxation after photoelectric absorption. Implementation into VMC++ of KERMA approximation has been validated.",cancer
"Fundus image fusion in EYEPLAN software: an evaluation of a novel technique for ocular melanoma radiation treatment planning. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel approach for treatment planning using digital fundus image fusion in EYEPLAN for proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) planning for ocular melanoma. The authors used a prototype version of EYEPLAN software, which allows for digital registration of high-resolution fundus photographs. The authors examined the improvement in tumor localization by replanning with the addition of fundus photo superimposition in patients with macular area tumors. METHODS: The new version of EYEPLAN (v3.05) software allows for the registration of fundus photographs as a background image. This is then used in conjunction with clinical examination, tantalum marker clips, surgeon's mapping, and ultrasound to draw the tumor contour accurately. In order to determine if the fundus image superimposition helps in tumor delineation and treatment planning, the authors identified 79 patients with choroidal melanoma in the macular location that were treated with PBRT. All patients were treated to a dose of 56 GyE in four fractions. The authors reviewed and replanned all 79 macular melanoma cases with superimposition of pretreatment and post-treatment fundus imaging in the new EYEPLAN software. For patients with no local failure, the authors analyzed whether fundus photograph fusion accurately depicted and confirmed tumor volumes as outlined in the original treatment plan. For patients with local failure, the authors determined whether the addition of the fundus photograph might have benefited in terms of more accurate tumor volume delineation. RESULTS: The mean follow-up of patients was 33.6 +/- 23 months. Tumor growth was seen in six eyes of the 79 macular lesions. All six patients were marginal failures or tumor miss in the region of dose fall-off, including one patient with both in-field recurrence as well as marginal. Among the six recurrences, three were managed by enucleation and one underwent retreatment with proton therapy. Three patients developed distant metastasis and all three patients have since died. The replanning of six patients with their original fundus photograph superimposed showed that in four cases, the treatment field adequately covered the tumor volume. In the other two patients, the overlaid fundus photographs indicated the area of marginal miss. The replanning with the fundus photograph showed improved tumor coverage in these two macular lesions. For the remaining patients without local failure, replanning with fundus photograph superimposition confirmed the tumor volume as drawn in the original treatment plan. CONCLUSIONS: Local control was excellent in patients receiving 56 GyE of PBRT for uveal melanomas in the macular region, which traditionally can be more difficult to control. Posterior lesions are better defined with the additional use of fundus image since they can be difficult to mark surgically. In one-third of treatment failing patients, the superposition of the fundus photograph would have clearly allowed improved localization of tumor. The current practice standard is to use the superimposition of the fundus photograph in addition to the surgeon's clinical and clip mapping of the tumor and ultrasound measurement to draw the tumor volume.",cancer
"Sensitivity of low energy brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition. PURPOSE: The objective of this work is to assess the sensitivity of Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition for a range of low photon energy brachytherapy sources: 125I, 103Pd, 131Cs, and an electronic brachytherapy source (EBS). The low energy photons emitted by these sources make the dosimetry sensitive to variations in tissue atomic number due to the dominance of the photoelectric effect. This work reports dose to a small mass of water in medium D(w,m) as opposed to dose to a small mass of medium in medium D(m,m). METHODS: Mean adipose, mammary gland, and breast tissues (as uniform mixture of the aforementioned tissues) are investigated as well as compositions corresponding to one standard deviation from the mean. Prostate mean compositions from three different literature sources are also investigated. Three sets of MC simulations are performed with the GEANT4 code: (1) Dose calculations for idealized TG-43-like spherical geometries using point sources. Radial dose profiles obtained in different media are compared to assess the influence of compositional uncertainties. (2) Dose calculations for four clinical prostate LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 125I seeds (Model 2301, Best Medical, Springfield, VA). The effect of varying the prostate composition in the planning target volume (PTV) is investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. (3) Dose calculations for four clinical breast LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 103Pd seeds (Model 2335, Best Medical). The effects of varying the adipose/gland ratio in the PTV and of varying the elemental composition of adipose and gland within one standard deviation of the assumed mean composition are investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. For (2) and (3), the influence of using the mass density from CT scans instead of unit mass density is also assessed. RESULTS: Results from simulation (1) show that variations in the mean compositions of tissues affect low energy brachytherapy dosimetry. Dose differences between mean and one standard deviation of the mean composition increasing with distance from the source are observed. It is established that the 125I and 131Cs sources are the least sensitive to variations in elemental compositions while 103Pd is most sensitive. The EBS falls in between and exhibits complex behavior due to significant spectral hardening. Results from simulation (2) show that two prostate compositions are dosimetrically equivalent to water while the third shows D90 differences of up to 4%. Results from simulation (3) show that breast is more sensitive than prostate with dose variations of up to 30% from water for 70% adipose/30% gland breast. The variability of the breast composition adds a +/- 10% dose variation. CONCLUSIONS: Low energy brachytherapy dose distributions in tissue differ from water and are influenced by density, mean tissue composition, and patient-to-patient composition variations. The results support the use of a dose calculation algorithm accounting for heterogeneities such as MC. Since this work shows that variations in mean tissue compositions affect MC dosimetry and result in increased dose uncertainties, the authors conclude that imaging tools providing more accurate estimates of elemental compositions such as dual energy CT would be beneficial.",cancer
"Respiratory distress in newborn: evaluation of chest X-rays. We discuss the anatomic and pathophysiological patterns of preterm and term newborn. Particular attention is directed to technical artefacts relating to the interpretation of chest radiography.

"The efficacy of chemical adjuvants on giant-cell tumour of bone. An in vitro study. Various chemicals are commonly used as adjuvant treatment to surgery for giant-cell tumour (GCT) of bone. The comparative effect of these solutions on the cells of GCT is not known. In this study we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of sterile water, 95% ethanol, 5% phenol, 3% hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and 50% zinc chloride (ZnCI(2)) on GCT monolayer tumour cultures which were established from six patients. The DNA content, the metabolic activity and the viability of the cultured samples of tumour cells were assessed at various times up to 120 hours after their exposure to these solutions. Equal cytotoxicity to the GCT monolayer culture was observed for 95% ethanol, 5% phenol, 3% H(2)O(2) and 50% ZnCI(2). The treated samples showed significant reductions in DNA content and metabolic activity 24 hours after treatment and this was sustained for up to 120 hours. The samples treated with sterile water showed an initial decline in DNA content and viability 24 hours after treatment, but the surviving cells were viable and had proliferated. No multinucleated cell formation was seen in these cultures. These results suggest that the use of chemical adjuvants other than water could help improve local control in the treatment of GCT of bone.",cancer
"Does the southern European cardiovascular mortality advantage extend to total mortality? 50-year trends in death risks between 40 and 70 years of age in Western European men and women. AIMS: To study 50-year mortality trends in men and women of northern and southern Western Europe. METHODS: The World Health Organization mortality data base and multiple decrement life table methods was used to compute all-cause and cause-specific risks of middle-age death (40-69 years of age) for northern (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and UK) and southern (France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland) Western European countries. RESULTS: From 1952 to 2001, the risk of a cardiovascular death in middle age was higher in the north compared to the south. The north/ south cardiovascular mortality ratios (MR) peaked in 1990-1993 and were 1.57 among women and 1.47 among men in 2001. In 1952, the all-cause risks of middle-age death were similar in the north and south for both women and men (39% and 27%, respectively). In 2001, middle-age death risks were similar for men in the north and the south (24% and 23%, MR = 1.05), but higher among women in the north compared to the south (14% and 11%, MR = 1.28). Cause-specific death risks demonstrated that the cardiovascular advantage for southern European men was countered by a disadvantage in cancer death risk (2001 north/south cancer MR = 0.85). For northern European women in 2001, there was a disadvantage also in the other major cause-of-death groups: cancer (MR = 1.22) and other diseases (MR = 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: The southern European cardiovascular middle-age mortality advantage extended to total mortality much more for women than for men. We suggest that forces behind this gender difference in this north/south mortality gradient include life style factors.",cancer
"Reassessing the standard of care in indolent lymphoma: a clinical update to improve clinical practice. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) represents a diverse group of hematologic malignancies originating in B or T lymphocytes. Approximately 85% of NHLs are of B-cell origin, with the remainder mostly of T-cell origin. The most common NHL types are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (31%) and follicular lymphoma (22%). More than 65,000 new cases of NHL develop each year, and approximately 20,000 people with NHL died of the disease 2009. NHL is the seventh most common cancer in the United States, contributes to approximately 4% to 5% of all cancer cases in the United States, and causes approximately 3% of all cancer-related deaths. Currently, nearly 500,000 people are living with the disease or are in remission. Several new and encouraging advances have been made in the treatment of indolent NHL. Although the watch and wait approach still has a role, combined immunochemotherapy remains the standard of care for both first-line and relapsed/refractory disease. As front-line treatment, bendamustine plus rituximab may become a new standard of care, especially for older patients. In contrast, rituximab in combination with chemotherapy followed by rituximab maintenance seems to be the optimal option in patients with relapsed disease.",cancer
"Preliminary report: the development of the NCCN Comparative Therapeutic Index as a clinical evaluative process for existing data in oncology. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) develops and communicates the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) to oncologists and other clinicians. The NCCN Guidelines are widely recognized and applied as the standard for clinical policy in the United States. These guidelines and related documents, such as the NCCN Drugs & Biologics Compendium (NCCN Compendium), are used extensively by public and private payors as the basis for the setting of coverage policies. Given the demand for comparative effectiveness (CE) analyses, as described and discussed in this report, the NCCN has begun work on a paradigm to integrate evidence-based CE analysis into the NCCN Guidelines deliberative process. This report presents NCCN's initial thinking on the use of NCCN expert panel members in developing a process that can be used to compare health care technologies (e.g., radiation modalities, chemotherapy regimens) in a formal, systematic way. Draft considerations are provided to stimulate discussion and feedback, particularly in the oncology community, as NCCN moves through processes such as methodologic review, validation of rating scales, and review of implications for public policy, toward finalization of an NCCN CE analytic paradigm.",cancer

"Development and assessment of a physical activity guidebook for the Colon Health and Life-Long Exercise Change (CHALLENGE) trial (NCIC CO.21). BACKGROUND: We report the development and assessment of a physical activity (PA) guidebook called Step Up to the Challenge that is being used to support a PA behavior change intervention in a randomized trial examining PA and disease-free survival in colon cancer survivors. METHODS: Content for the PA guidebook was constructed based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Expert judges (N = 51) included oncologists, rehabilitation practitioners, colon cancer survivors, and TPB researchers. All expert judges completed the Maine Area Health Education Center checklist for evaluating written health information. A subset of TPB expert judges (n = 11) also assessed the degree of match between the guidebook content and TPB constructs. RESULTS: Expert judges indicated that the PA guidebook achieved desirable attributes for organization, writing style, appearance, appeal, feasibility, and appropriateness. For the TPB assessment, all mean item-content relevance ratings indicated at least a ""very good match"" between the PA guidebook content and the TPB constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Our guidebook successfully targets the TPB constructs known to influence PA behavior change and contains suitable and appropriate written health information. This guidebook will be an integral component of the behavioral support program designed to determine the effects of PA on disease-free survival in colon cancer survivors.",cancer
"An acute exercise session increases self-efficacy in sedentary endometrial cancer survivors and controls. BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy can be affected by mastery experiences and somatic sensations. A novel exercise experience and associated sensations may impact self-efficacy and subsequent behaviors. We investigated the effect of a single exercise session on self-efficacy for sedentary endometrial cancer survivors compared with sedentary women of a similar age, but with no cancer history. METHODS: Twenty survivors and 19 controls completed an exercise session performed as a submaximal cycle ergometry test. Sensations and efficacy were measured before and after exercise. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Regression models were used to determine predictors of self-efficacy and subsequent exercise. RESULTS: Self-efficacy increased for both survivors and controls, but survivors had a higher rate of increase, and the change predicted subsequent exercise. The association between exercise-related somatic sensations and self-efficacy differed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: A novel exercise experience had a larger effect on self-efficacy and subsequent exercise activity for endometrial cancer survivors than controls. Somatic sensations experienced during exercise may differ for survivors, which may be related to the experience of having cancer. Understanding factors affecting confidence in novel exercise experiences for populations with specific cancer histories is of the utmost importance in the adoption of exercise behaviors.",cancer
"Necessity of bilateral bone marrow biopsies for ancillary cytogenetic studies in the pediatric population. The need for bilateral pediatric bone marrow biopsies for cytogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies has not been clearly delineated. We retrospectively identified 166 pediatric bilateral bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained from patients with a variety of clinical diagnoses, including solid tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, and other hematologic conditions. The cases included all pediatric bilateral bone marrow biopsies performed at our hospital spanning the years of 1992 to 2008. Agreement of FISH and classical cytogenetic results between the 2 sides was assessed. Of a total of 166 bilateral cases, 2 cases showed disagreement (1.2%), both from patients with solid tumors. One case was a rhabdomyosarcoma, in which FISH only was performed; the second was a neuroblastoma in which FISH and cytogenetics were performed (both FISH and classical cytogenetic results disagreed). The remainder of the cases showed complete agreement between the 2 sides (total 98.8%). We conclude that it is usually not necessary to perform bilateral bone marrow biopsies for FISH and cytogenetics in the pediatric population outside of the setting of solid tumor staging.",cancer
"Transformation of follicular lymphoma to plasmablastic lymphoma with c-myc gene rearrangement. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent lymphoma that transforms to high-grade lymphoma, mostly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in about a third of patients. We present the first report of a case of FL that transformed to plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). Clonal transformation of the FL to PBL was evidenced by identical IGH/BCL2 gene rearrangements and VDJ gene usage in rearranged IGH genes. IGH/ BCL2 translocation was retained in the PBL, which also acquired c-myc gene rearrangement. Genealogic analysis based on somatic hypermutation of the rearranged IGH genes of both FL and PBL suggests that transformation of the FL to PBL occurred most likely by divergent evolution from a common progenitor cell rather than direct evolution from the FL clone. Our study of this unusual case expands the histologic spectrum of FL transformation and increases our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of transformation of indolent lymphomas to aggressive lymphomas.",cancer
"Aspiration cytomorphology of fetal adenocarcinoma of the lung. Fetal adenocarcinoma (FA) of the lung is an exceedingly rare malignancy. Many patients with the well-differentiated form are relatively young and with the high-grade variant are older. We describe the cases of 4 women with FA examined by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Aspirates were moderately cellular with malignant, mostly aggregated cells. Glands and acini were present. The columnar neoplastic epithelial cells had homogeneous round nuclei with fine chromatin, smooth membranes, and indistinct nucleoli. With the rapid Romanowsky stain, subnuclear vacuoles were evident in some tumor cells; at times, this was associated with a focal extracellular tigroid pattern. Morule formation was present in the 3 specimens. Immunochemically, all tumors manifested epithelial and neuroendocrine differentiation. Cytomorphologic attributes included the following: (1) distinct subnuclear vacuoles, sometimes with an associated tigroid picture; (2) small, uniform, round nuclei; (3) morules; and (4) neuroendocrine differentiation in glandular epithelial cells.",cancer
"Lack of HER2 overexpression and amplification in small intestinal adenocarcinoma. HER2 overexpression and amplification have been studied as a therapeutic and prognostic target in a number of human cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal adenocarcinomas. However, HER2 status has not been well investigated in primary small intestinal adenocarcinoma, probably because of its rarity. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER2 on 49 primary nonampullar small intestinal adenocarcinomas. The results showed a complete lack of HER2 protein expression in 47 cases (96%) by immunohistochemical analysis. Only 2 cases (4%) showed a 1+ staining pattern. No tumors exhibited 2+ or 3+ HER2 immunoreactivity. By FISH, none of the tumors, including those with 1+ HER2 immunoreactivity, exhibited HER2 gene amplification. These observations demonstrate that HER2 protein overexpression and gene amplification are infrequent events, if they occur at all, in small intestinal adenocarcinoma. Thus, routine immunohistochemical and/or FISH testing for HER2 for potential targeted anti-HER2 therapy may not be beneficial for patients with primary small intestinal adenocarcinoma.",cancer
"Molecular and immunohistologic analyses cannot reliably solve diagnostic variation of flat intraepithelial lesions of the urinary bladder. We examined diagnostic variation of flat intraurothelial lesions with comparison with immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. Nine uropathologists diagnosed 23 biopsy samples from the urinary bladder. The samples were analyzed by immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 20, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin, Ki-67, p53, and p16(INK4a), and multicolor FISH using the UroVysion probe set (Vysis, Abbott, Des Plaines, IL). Diagnostic agreement for each classification and for nonneoplastic or neoplastic lesions was obtained in 8 (35%) and 16 (70%) of 23 lesions, respectively. The preference ratio of neoplasia to nonneoplasia (0.9 to 4.8) or carcinoma in situ to dysplasia (0.2 to 4.0) also varied among the pathologists. In 6 ancillary analyses, the majority of neoplastic lesions with diagnostic agreement indicated more than 2 aberrant results, whereas the majority of lesions without diagnostic agreement showed no or only 1 aberrant result. The molecular and immunohistochemical analyses can discriminate between neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions; however, they cannot reliably solve diagnostic variation of flat intraepithelial lesions.",cancer
"Neurological complications of systemic cancer. Neurological complications of systemic cancer-those arising outside the nervous system-can be distressing, disabling, and sometimes fatal. Diagnosis is often difficult because different neurological disorders may present with similar signs and symptoms. Furthermore, comorbid neurological illnesses, common in elderly patients with cancer, can complicate diagnosis. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can improve neurological symptoms and can substantially enhance a patient's quality of life. We approach the problem of neurological complications of systemic cancer as would a neurologist: first by identifying the anatomical area or areas that are affected (ie, brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve), then by evaluating the diagnostic approach, considering the symptoms and signs and including appropriate laboratory tests, and finally, by recommending treatment. We focus on disorders that are difficult to diagnose, need neurological consultation, and for which effective treatments exist.",cancer
"Minimally invasive diagnosis of sarcoidosis by EBUS when conventional diagnostics fail. BACKGROUND: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine-needle aspiration (EBUS) is a minimally invasive method used routinely for mediastinal staging of patients with lung cancer. EBUS has also proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with different intrathoracic lesions who remain undiagnosed despite bronchoscopy and CT-guided fine-needle aspiration. OBJECTIVE: The present study focused on EBUS for diagnosing sarcoidosis. DESIGN: During a 3-year period 308 of 601 patients who underwent EBUS at our institution were referred for further diagnostic of a radiologically suspicious lesion in the lung parenchyma (n = 195), enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum (n = 89), a suspicious tumor in the mediastinum or pleural disease (n = 24) but no one had a definite histological diagnosis. All charts were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 308 patients 43 (14%) were eventually diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Thirty-three (77%) were diagnosed with EBUS. In the remaining 10 patients EBUS did not provide adequate tissue samples in 4 (9%) and in 6 patients (14%) EBUS provided adequate tissue but no definite diagnosis. EBUS was significantly better to establish the diagnosis in patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes compared with isolated lung parenchymal involvement (85% vs 63%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: EBUS is a valuable minimally invasive diagnostic modality to establish the diagnosis of sarcoidosis of unselected patients with undiagnosed intrathoracic lesions after conventional work up--particularly if patients have enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. This minimally invasive procedure provides a final diagnosis without exposing the patient to the risk of complications from more invasive procedures.",cancer
"Preventing and managing vesicant chemotherapy extravasations. Although vesicant chemotherapy extravasations cannot be entirely prevented, the risk of extravasation can be reduced by adhering to guidelines for safe vesicant administration. These include engaging patients in extravasation-prevention efforts, thoroughly assessing patients receiving vesicants, selecting an appropriate administration site for peripheral vesicant administration, and checking for a blood return prior to and during vesicant administration. In addition, whenever an extravasation occurs or is suspected, vesicant administration must immediately cease, and the appropriate antidote or treatment needs to be promptly administered.",cancer
"Longitudinal effects of social support and adaptive coping on the emotional well-being of survivors of localized prostate cancer. Survivors of prostate cancer experience treatment-related physical side effects that can compromise emotional well-being for years post-treatment. There is limited research investigating how social support and the use of coping may affect the emotional well-being of this population following treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate how social support and coping impact emotional well-being 2 years after treatment in survivors of localized prostate cancer who have received either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Psychosocial and disease-specific measures were administered to an ethnically and demographically diverse sample of 180 men treated for localized prostate cancer at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. Regression analyses demonstrated that higher levels of social support at baseline predicted better emotional well-being 2 years later. Furthermore, higher levels of adaptive coping at baseline partially mediated the relationship between social support and emotional well-being. Supportive relationships may contribute to improved emotional well-being following treatment by facilitating the use of adaptive coping strategies. Attention should be given to strengthening social support networks and educating survivors of prostate cancer on adaptive coping techniques.",cancer
"Obtaining data on comorbid diabetes among patients in a U.S. population-based tumor registry. Comorbid diabetes mellitus has been shown to be associated with outcomes among cancer patients, but population-based data have been limited to elderly patients through linkages between the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database and Medicare databases. Reporting of comorbidity to the population-based Connecticut SEER registry is not required, but the extent of voluntary reporting of comorbid diabetes was assessed in this preliminary study. Of 15,145 Connecticut residents diagnosed at age 20+ years with invasive cancer in 2006, who were ascertained from 33 registry sources, 8688 (57.4%) from 21 sources were included in the analysis of comorbid diabetes. The prevalence of comorbid diabetes was 12.5%, and was lowest for patients with prostate cancer (8.5%) and highest for with liver-pancreas cancer (25.9%), consistent with the literature. Diabetes prevalence was substantial (9.5%) within the non-elderly subgroup aged 20-64 years at cancer diagnosis who comprised 45% of the 8688 patients. These results indicate an opportunity for future large-scale studies of the impact of diabetes on outcomes among all newly diagnosed cancer patients (both non-elderly and elderly) in the Connecticut SEER registry and other US central cancer registries.",cancer
"Improving geocoding outcomes for the Nebraska Cancer Registry: learning from proven practices. This report summarizes geocoding improvement experiments in the Nebraska Cancer Registry. An initial assessment of previous geocoding suggests that some proven geocoding procedures have not been followed, and overall results were unacceptable. This study concluded that when updating different address files from different time periods, it is sufficient to use the most recent street centerline database. The combination of match score of 80 and spelling sensitivity of 80 in ESRI's ArcGIS geocoder is sufficient for most geocoding purposes. Given the sizable number of unmatched addresses, the Google Maps geocoding service was used. A comparison of 1500 high-quality addresses that were matched by both Google Maps and ArcGIS geocoders shows that, in most cases, the location discrepancies between the two were acceptable. The median distance between each pair of 1500 coded locations was 36.6 meters, with an average of 92.8 meters. Distance discrepancies were larger in urban fringe areas and smaller toward urban centers. It was concluded that by strictly following proven procedures including address coding specification, Internet-based White Pages for reverse address finding, and Internet-based geocoding, a 90% or even a 95% match rate is achievable.",cancer
"The relationship between methylation of the Syk gene in the promoter region and the genesis of lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To study the expression of the Syk (Spleen Tyrosine Kinase) gene and methylation in its promoter region in lung cancer. To investigate the relationship between silencing of the Syk gene and DNA methylation of the Syk promoter region. METHODS: RT-PCR (Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR), Real-time PCR (Real-time quantitative PCR) and immunohistochemistry technique, the expression of Syk in specimens from 3 lung cancer cell lines and 16 lung cancer patients (tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues). MSP (Methylation-specific PCR) was used to analyze the methylation status of the Syk promoter region. Then we also investigated the role of restoring Syk expression by using a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-CdR (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), in suppressing invasion of lung cell lines. RESULTS: No expression of the Syk gene was detected in the 3 lung cancer cell lines. In the 16 lung patient samples, Syk expression was significantly lower in the tumor tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.05). Consistently, immunohistochemistry analyses of Syk protein expression showed that in the cancer tissues Syk protein expression accounted for 5% (1/20), and in the adjacent normal tissues the rate of expression was 100% (20/20). The correlation was highly significant (chi2 = 36.19, P < 0.005). In the only case that showed a positive expression of cancer textus, the level was inferior to the adjacent tissue. In the two lung cancer cell lines (L9981, A549) that lack the endogenous Syk epression, 4uM demethylation agent 5-aza-CdR treatment was able to reactivate the Syk gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation leads to silencing of the Syk gene in human lung carcinoma. Methylation of the Syk promoter and loss of Syk expression in lung cancer are independent biomarkers, a determination which may offer guidance for selecting appropriate diagnoses and treatments. Syk may be a potential tumor suppressor in human lung cancer.",cancer
"Hemoperitoneum caused by a bleeding myoma in pregnancy. The prevalence of uterine myomas during pregnancy is estimated to range from 0.3% to 2.6%. Although leiomyomas usually remain asymptomatic, in one often cases they may be complicated. The management of uterine fibroids during pregnancy is largely conservative and surgical removal is generally delayed until post partum. A 37-year-old pregnant woman (15 weeks) with a history of gynecologic examination several hours before presented with lower abdominal pain and signs of acute abdomen. She was para-2, as she had delivered a healthy child 12 years before, and current pregnancy was uncomplicated until presentation. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage was suspected and she underwent immediate exploratory laparotomy, which revealed massive hemoperitoneum. A subserous uterine leiomyoma of 8.5x6.5 cm was found in the fundus area, with an actively bleeding ruptured vessel on its dome. Myomectomy was successfully performed and 1.5 liter of blood and blood clots were evacuated from the peritoneal cavity. The histology report showed sections of interlacing bundles of smooth muscles with areas of bleeding and necrotic degeneration. The postoperative course and subsequent antenatal period were uneventful. The woman went into spontaneous labor at 38 weeks and delivered vaginally a healthy male baby. This rare case ofintra-abdominal hemorrhage due to bleeding myoma supports other recent studies, which have demonstrated that myomectomy may be successfully performed during pregnancy in selected circumstances.",cancer
"Synchronous rectal adenocarcinoma and bilateral clear cell renal carcinoma. A 69-year-old man was admitted for resection of rectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed by colonoscopy. Preoperative computed tomography scan and abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilateral renal tumors measuring up to 2 and 2.8 cm in largest diameter, respectively. The patient underwent partial colectomy and bilateral partial nephrectomy. Microscopically, rectal adenocarcinoma penetrated the submucosa, without invasion of the muscularis propria. Both renal tumors were clear cell renal carcinomas of Fuhrmann nuclear grade 2. To our knowledge, this is the first case of synchronous adenocarcinoma of the rectum and bilateral clear cell renal cell carcinoma described in the literature to date.",cancer
"Increases in quantitative D-dimer levels correlate with progressive disease better than circulating tumor cell counts in patients with refractory prostate cancer. Changes in quantitative D-dimer levels, circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were measured in 28 patients with refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer to assess their concordance during the course of therapy and their relationship with risk of progressive disease. A significant correlation was identified between changes in PSA and both CTC counts and D-dimer levels (r = 0.67 and 0.58, respectively; P < .001). In addition, there was a significant correlation between changes in CTC count and D-dimer level (r = 0.62; P < .001). A significantly stronger concordance between these biomarkers was noted for increasing values (sensitivity, 72%-77.8%) compared with decreasing values (specificity, 43.8%-71.4%). Notably, increases in PSA and D-dimer levels, not CTC counts, were associated with increased risks for progressive disease (P < .024). Increases in quantitative D-dimer levels correlate with progressive disease better than CTC counts in patients with refractory prostate cancer.",cancer
"A new approach for identifying patients with ovarian epithelial neoplasms based on high-resolution mass spectrometry. We investigated the serum profiles of patients with ovarian neoplasm using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to obtain serum ""fingerprints"" for use in identifying patients with these neoplasms. We used HPLC-HRMS to analyze serum samples from patients with ovarian neoplasms and control subjects. Serum samples from 145 patients were analyzed, including 85 with ovarian epithelial neoplasms. We also compared the results of this serum-fingerprinting approach with the results of the CA-125 test and imaging. Fingerprinting successfully permitted the separation of control patients and patients with ovarian neoplasms. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were between 96% and 100%. When the results of this test were concordant with the results of the CA-125 test, 99% of serum samples were correctly classified as being from a patient with an ovarian neoplasm or with no ovarian neoplasm. We found that a metabolite of molecular weight 472 is the main metabolite in the separation of patients with ovarian neoplasms from control subjects.

We evaluated its immunohistochemical expression in 317 primary and 42 metastatic renal neoplasms (186 clear cell, 52 papillary, 35 chromophobe, 47 unclassified, and 15 Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinomas [RCCs]; 26 oncocytomas; 2 metanephric adenomas; 1 urothelial carcinoma; 1 mixed epithelial and stromal tumor; and 1 angiomyolipoma); 7 neoplasms were unknown as to whether they were primary or metastatic. We also correlated expression with tumor type and grade. Variable staining was seen in clear cell, papillary, unclassified, and Xp11.2 translocation carcinomas. One chromophobe carcinoma had focal expression. No staining was seen with other tumors. An association was found between high expression and clear cell vs non-clear cell carcinomas with all cases (P < .01) and primary (P < .01) cases. An association between CAIX expression and grade (P < .01) in primary clear cell carcinomas was found. CAIX expression is more common in clear cell RCC than other renal tumor types and is associated with grade.",cancer
"Dimensional versus categorical use of the PHQ-9 depression scale among persons with non-small-cell lung cancer: a pilot study including quality-of-life comparisons. The debate over the relative usefulness of categorical (yes/no) versus dimensional (continuous scales) assessments for determining mental illness has been running strong for nearly a half century. In order to address the utility of each of these assessment methods within the cancer population, in the present study, the dimensional and categorical scoring systems of the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression were compared among patients (n = 14) in the pretreatment stages for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Also included in the study was an additional dimensional measure of depression, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). As predicted, dimensional assessments resulted in higher estimates of depression than did the categorical assessment. As predicted, the dimensional depression assessments, including the PHQ-9 and the BDI-II, which showed depression prevalence rates of 43% and 36%, respectively, produced higher estimates of depression than did the categorical system of the PHQ-9, whose use did not result in any patients being diagnosed with major depression or other depression. Also, as predicted, in terms of quality of life, patients found to be depressed by both the BDI-II and the dimensional PHQ-9 reported significantly worse physical, functional, and emotional well-being than did their nondepressed counterparts. Study findings suggest a need for further investigation into the possibility that patients who score highly on the dimensional scoring system of the PHQ-9 but at values below threshold on the more commonly accepted categorical scoring system of the same measure would benefit from consideration for psychotherapeutic treatment.",cancer
"A prospective crossover pilot study to evaluate the use of a topical wound gel in patients with cutaneous toxicity caused by epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. One of the dose-limiting toxicities of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) is a papulopustular rash that is often pruritic and painful. Secondary skin infection can occur from scratching to relieve the pruritus. Studies suggest that this rash might be a surrogate marker for efficacy; therefore, effective rash management is needed to allow patients to use EGFRIs without unnecessary dose modifications. In this single-center, prospective, crossover study, we evaluated the use of a topical gel (Regenecare Wound Gel) for relieving the pruritus and pain of EGFRI-induced rash among oncology patients. The secondary end points were patient satisfaction, adverse effects, and EGFRI dose modifications. At the occurrence of grade 2 skin rash, patients started applying the study gel to the right side of their face; after 1 week, they began applying it to both sides of their face for up to an additional 5 weeks. Each week, providers performed a facial evaluation and patients rated their symptoms and satisfaction on questionnaires. Of the 20 patients enrolled, 13 were evaluable. Reduction in itch at the end of week 1 was greater on the right (treated) side in 69% of patients greater on the left (untreated) side in 8%, and the same in 23% (P = 0.01). The pattern was similar for pain, but the differences were not significant. On average, patients rated the gel as being moderately to extremely effective for alleviating symptoms, improving rash appearance, and promoting healing and found it easy to apply. No adverse effects were documented. Four patients (31%) required EGFRI dose modifications because of rash. Taken together, these findings suggest that the topical wound gel is effective in relieving rash-associated itching in patients receiving EGFRIs and is associated with high patient satisfaction.",cancer
"Including self-reported race to improve cancer surveillance data for American Indians and Alaska Natives in Washington state. BACKGROUND: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are frequently misclassified as another race in cancer surveillance systems, resulting in underestimated morbidity and mortality. Linkage methods with administrative records have been used to correct AI/AN misclassification, but AI/AN populations living in urban areas, and those who self-identify as AI/AN race, continue to be under-ascertained. The aim of this study was to evaluate racial misclassification in two cancer registries in Washington State using an urban AI/AN patient roster linked with a list of Indian Health Service (IHS) enrollees. METHODS: We conducted probabilistic record linkages to identify racial misclassification using a combined demographic dataset of self-identified AI/AN patients of a large, urban Indian health center, and administratively-identified AI/AN enrolled with the IHS. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated for 3 linkage populations: AI/ AN originally coded in each cancer registry, post-linkage AI/AN identified through the IHS roster alone, and post-linkage AI/AN identified through either the urban or IHS file. RESULTS: In the state and regional cancer registries, 11% and 18%, respectively, of matched cases were originally coded as a race other than AI/AN; approximately 35% of these were identified by the urban file alone. Incidence rate estimates increased after linkage with the IHS file, and further increased with the addition of urban records. Matches identified by the urban patient file resulted in the largest relative incidence change being demonstrated for King County (which includes Seattle); the all-site invasive cancer rate increased 8.8%, from 443 to 482 per 100,000. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of urban and self-identified AI/AN records can increase case ascertainment in cancer surveillance systems beyond linkage methods using only administrative sources.",cancer
"A case of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder: immunohistochemistry and differential diagnosis. The morphological spectrum of gallbladder carcinoma is broad and variable. Most of these tumors are tubular adenocarcinomas. There are some tumors with unusual morphology that may be difficult to classify due to their rarity. One of such tumors is the signet-ring cell carcinoma, which is a highly aggressive, mucin producing variant of gallbladder adenocarcinoma predominantly or exclusively composed of signet-ring cells. Histologically, these tumors are similar to their counterparts in other organs such as stomach, colon and breast, and should not be misinterpreted as metastatic carcinoma from one of these primary sites. The literature about this variant of carcinoma is sparse and little is known about it. We found only three cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder previously reported. We present the case of an 86-year-old woman with signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder and discuss the potential diagnostic dilemmas",cancer
"Brain tumors and epilepsy. Brain tumors are a common cause of epilepsy. Tumor type and location are determining factors that significantly influence seizure frequency. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical data of patients diagnosed with brain tumors and epilepsy. Data for this study were obtained from patient medical records over a 6-year period (2000-2005). Patient history and findings obtained by diagnostic methods such as electroencephalography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance were analyzed. Data were analyzed by appropriate statistical methods and the structure, prevalence, mean and standard deviation were calculated. The significance of results was tested by use of t-test and chi2-test. A total of 15 933 patient charts were analyzed. Out of 15 933 patients, 10.8% were diagnosed with epilepsy and 175 (1.09%) patients had brain tumor, 75 (42.86%) of which were significantly associated with epilepsy (P > 0.05). Almost forty-three percent (42.86%) of tumors were epileptogenic, with no significant sex difference (confidence level of 95%). Fifty-seven (32.5%) brain tumor patients were aged 51-60. The mean age of all patients with brain tumors was 41.6 years. Focal sensorimotor seizures were dominant in 40 (53.3%) cases. Among epilepsy cases with known etiology, 75 (6.8%) patients had epileptogenic tumors. Types of seizures in patients with epilepsy were different from seizures provoked by brain tumors. The most common tumor site was temporal region (43.4%). There was no significant difference according to epileptogenesis. Focal sensorimotor seizures were common in patients with frontal and parietal region tumors.",cancer
"Diverse phenotypic profile of uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors: an immunohistochemical study of 12 cases. BACKGROUND: Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors (UTROSCTs) are rare neoplasms thought to be of putative endometrial stromal origin and solely composed of sex cord elements. Our study aimed to delineate the immunophenotype of these tumors and to verify whether their morphology reflects true sex cord-like differentiation. DESIGN: Representative paraffin blocks from 12 UTROSCTs were selected after confirmation of the diagnosis. Cords and/or trabeculae were seen in all tumors, whereas tubules, diffuse areas, and a retiform pattern were present in 9, 6, and 2 cases, respectively. Tumors were stained for sex cord (inhibin, calretinin, WT1, and melan-A), epithelial (KL1 and epithelial membrane antigen), and smooth muscle markers (smooth muscle actin, desmin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, h-caldesmon, and histone deacetylase-8), CD10, HMB45, S100, and CD117. Intensity and percentage of staining were recorded. RESULTS: Six out of 12 tumors were positive for sex cord markers (inhibin 3 of 12, calretinin 4 of 12, WT1 4 of 12, and melan-A 3 of 11) with 4 tumors coexpressing more than one marker. Half of the UTROSCTs showed positivity for KL1, with 2 tumors coexpressing epithelial membrane antigen. All but one tumor expressed one or more smooth muscle markers, with smooth muscle actin, desmin and histone deacetylase-8 being most commonly expressed. CD10 was positive in 6 of 12 tumors, CD117 in 4 of 12, and S100 in 2 of 11 tumors, whereas HMB45 was negative in 11 tumors tested. CONCLUSIONS: UTROSCTs have a diverse immunohistochemical profile often coexpressing sex cord, epithelial, and smooth muscle markers. The expression of smooth muscle markers in these tumors does not imply a smooth muscle origin as endometrial and sex cord stromal tumors are not infrequently positive for these markers. Positivity for sex cord markers supports a true sex cord/steroid phenotype. Although the immunohistochemical profile of these tumors overlaps with that of endometrial stromal tumors with sex cord-like differentiation as well as ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, the origin of UTROSCT remains uncertain.",cancer
"Intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasm (IAPN): characterization of tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia occurring within the ampulla: a clinicopathologic analysis of 82 cases. BACKGROUND: There has been no uniform terminology for systematic analysis of mass-forming preinvasive neoplasms (which we term tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia) that occur specifically within the ampulla. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of these neoplasms, which we propose to refer to as intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasm (IAPN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and seventeen glandular neoplasms involving the ampulla were identified through a review of 1469 pancreatoduodenectomies and 11 ampullectomies. Eighty-two neoplasms characterized by substantial preinvasive exophytic component that grew almost exclusively (>75%) within the ampulla (in the ampullary channel or intra-ampullary portions of the very distal segments of the common bile duct or pancreatic duct) were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Clinical: The mean age was 64 years, male/female ratio was 2.4, and mean tumor size was 2.7 cm. (2) Pathology: The tumors had a mixture of both papillary and tubular growth (each constituting at least 25% of the lesion) in 57%; predominantly (>75%) papillary in 23%, and predominantly (>75%) tubular in 20%. High-grade dysplasia was present in 94% of cases, of which 39% showed focal (<25% of the lesion), 28% showed substantial (25% to 75%), and 27% showed extensive (>75%) high-grade dysplasia. In terms of cell-lineage morphology, 45% had a mixture of patterns. However, when evaluated with a forced-binary approach as intestinal (INT) versus gastric/pancreatobiliary (GPB) based on the predominant pattern, 74% were classified as INT and 26% as GPB. (3) Immunohistochemistry: Percent sensitivity/specificity of cell-lineage markers were, for INT phenotype: MUC2 85/78 and CDX2 94/61; and for GBP: MUC1 89/79, MUC5AC 95/69, and MUC6 83/76, respectively. Cytokeratin 7 and 20 were coexpressed in more than half. (4) Invasive carcinoma: In 64 cases (78%), there was an associated invasive carcinoma. Size of the tumor and amount of dysplasia correlated with the incidence of invasion. Invasive carcinoma was of INT-type in 58% and of pancreatobiliary-type in 42%. Cell lineage in the invasive component was the same as that of the preinvasive component in 84%. All discrepant cases were pancreatobiliary-type invasions, which occurred in INT-type preinvasive lesions. (5) Outcome: The overall survival of invasive cases were significantly worse than that of noninvasive ones (57% vs. 93%; P=0.01); and 3 years, 69% versus 100% (P=0.08); and 5 years, 45% versus 100% (P=0.07), respectively. When compared with 166 conventional invasive carcinomas of the ampullary region, invasive IAPNs had significantly better prognosis with a mean survival of 51 versus 31 months (P<0.001) and the 3-year survival of 69% versus 44% (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia occurring within the ampulla are highly analogous to pancreatic or biliary intraductal papillary and tubular neoplasms as evidenced by their papillary and/or tubular growth, variable cell lineage, and spectrum of dysplastic change (adenoma-carcinoma sequence), and thus we propose to refer to these as IAPN. IAPNs are biologically indolent; noninvasive examples show an excellent prognosis, whereas those with invasion exhibit a malignant but nevertheless significantly better prognosis than typical invasive ampullary carcinomas unaccompanied by IAPNs. Twenty eight percent (64 of 230) of invasive carcinomas within the ampulla arise in association with IAPNs.",cancer
"Mutations in GNA11 in uveal melanoma. BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular cancer. There are no effective therapies for metastatic disease. Mutations in GNAQ, the gene encoding an alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, are found in 40% of uveal melanomas. METHODS: We sequenced exon 5 of GNAQ and GNA11, a paralogue of GNAQ, in 713 melanocytic neoplasms of different types (186 uveal melanomas, 139 blue nevi, 106 other nevi, and 282 other melanomas). We sequenced exon 4 of GNAQ and GNA11 in 453 of these samples and in all coding exons of GNAQ and GNA11 in 97 uveal melanomas and 45 blue nevi. RESULTS: We found somatic mutations in exon 5 (affecting Q209) and in exon 4 (affecting R183) in both GNA11 and GNAQ, in a mutually exclusive pattern. Mutations affecting Q209 in GNA11 were present in 7% of blue nevi, 32% of primary uveal melanomas, and 57% of uveal melanoma metastases. In contrast, we observed Q209 mutations in GNAQ in 55% of blue nevi, 45% of uveal melanomas, and 22% of uveal melanoma metastases. Mutations affecting R183 in either GNAQ or GNA11 were less prevalent (2% of blue nevi and 6% of uveal melanomas) than the Q209 mutations. Mutations in GNA11 induced spontaneously metastasizing tumors in a mouse model and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Of the uveal melanomas we analyzed, 83% had somatic mutations in GNAQ or GNA11. Constitutive activation of the pathway involving these two genes appears to be a major contributor to the development of uveal melanoma.

"Doxorubicin plus sorafenib vs doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: In a randomized phase 3 trial, 400 mg of sorafenib twice daily prolonged overall survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh A disease. In a phase 1 study, sorafenib combined with doxorubicin, 60 mg/m(2), was well tolerated by patients with refractory solid tumors. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin in patients with advanced HCC has not been evaluated in a phase 2 or 3 trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin plus sorafenib compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a double-blind phase 2 multinational study, conducted from April 2005 to October 2006, 96 patients (76% male; median age, 65 years [range, 38-82 years]) with advanced HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, Child-Pugh A status, and no prior systemic therapy were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin intravenously every 21 days plus either 400 mg of sorafenib or placebo orally twice a day. The date of the last patient's follow-up was April 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to progression as determined by independent review. RESULTS: Following complete accrual, an unplanned early analysis for efficacy was performed by the independent data monitoring committee, so the trial was halted. The 2 patients remaining in the placebo group at that time were offered sorafenib. Based on 51 progressions, 63 deaths, and 70 events for progression-free survival, median time to progression was 6.4 months in the sorafenib-doxorubicin group (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-9.2), and 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.6-5) in the doxorubicin-placebo monotherapy group (P = .02). Median overall survival was 13.7 months (95% CI, 8.9--not reached) and 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.5-9.9; P = .006), and progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.6-8.6) and 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.8) in these groups, respectively (P = .006). Toxicity profiles were similar to those for the single agents. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced HCC, treatment with sorafenib plus doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin monotherapy resulted in greater median time to progression, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The degree to which this improvement may represent synergism between sorafenib and doxorubicin remains to be defined. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin is not yet indicated for routine clinical use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00108953.",cancer
"Patient-centered discussions about prostate cancer screening: a real-world approach. National guidelines recommend that primary care providers discuss the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening with their patients but give little guidance on how to fit such a complex discussion into a busy clinic encounter. The authors propose a process-oriented approach (Ask-Tell-Ask) that promotes tailored conversations and value-based recommendations. The Ask-Tell-Ask approach includes diagnosing a patient's informational needs, providing targeted education based on those needs, and making a shared decision about testing. This time-efficient model emphasizes the provider's role as an interactive guide rather than a one-way supplier of information. Although there is no way to make these discussions simple, this streamlined strategy can help patients and providers efficiently negotiate the complex and important decision of screening for prostate cancer.",cancer
"Transoral robotic surgery for advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. OBJECTIVES: To determine the oncologic and functional outcomes in patients undergoing primary transoral robotic surgery followed by adjuvant therapy as indicated with a minimum of 18-month follow-up for advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. DESIGN: Prospective single-center cohort study. SETTING: Academic university health system and tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Forty-seven adults with newly diagnosed and previously untreated advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. INTERVENTION: Transoral robotic surgery with staged neck dissection and adjuvant therapy as indicated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Margin status, recurrence, disease-specific and disease-free survival, gastrostomy tube dependence, and safety and efficacy end points. RESULTS: In the 47 patients enrolled with stages III and IV advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma, mean follow-up was 26.6 months. There was no intraoperative or postoperative mortality. Resection margins were positive in 1 patient (2%). At last follow-up, local recurrence was identified in 1 patient (2%), regional recurrence in 2 (4%), and distant recurrence in 4 (9%). Disease-specific survival was 98% (45 of 46 patients) at 1 year and 90% (27 of 30 patients) at 2 years. Based on pathologic risk stratification, 18 of 47 patients (38%) avoided chemotherapy, and 5 patients (11%) did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in their treatment regimen. At minimum follow-up of 1 year, only 1 patient required a gastrostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS: This novel transoral robotic surgery treatment regimen offers disease control, survival, and safety commensurate with standard treatments and an unexpected beneficial outcome of gastrostomy dependency rates that are markedly lower than those reported with standard nonsurgical therapies.",cancer
"Neck dissection after chemoradiotherapy: timing and complications. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of postchemoradiotherapy (post-CRT) neck dissection (ND) complications; to ascertain whether timing (< 12 vs >/= 12 weeks) from CRT to ND or other factors are associated with increased complications; and to determine whether ND timing influences disease control or survival. DESIGN: Ten-year retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: One hundred five patients with head and neck cancer undergoing ND after CRT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications and survival variables compared between groups undergoing ND less than 12 weeks (less-than-12-weeks ND group) and 12 weeks or more (12-weeks-or-more ND group) after CRT. RESULTS: Sixty-seven NDs were performed less than 12 weeks and 38 were performed 12 weeks or more after CRT. Patient characteristics, treatment, and ND pathology results were comparable between the 2 ND groups. The incidence of complications between the less-than-12-weeks and the 12-weeks-or-more ND groups included major wound complications in 8 of 67 (11.9%) vs 1 of 38 (2.6%; P = .15), minor wound complications in 11 of 67 (16.4%) vs 4 of 38 (10.5%; P = .56), airway complications in 7 of 67 (10.4%) vs 2 of 38 (5.3%; P = .48), and systemic complications in 9 of 67 (13.4%) vs 2 of 38 (5.3%; P = .32). The number of patients with at least 1 complication was significantly smaller in the 12-weeks-or-more ND group (P = .04). Multivariate analysis showed that radical ND was significantly associated with an increased number of complications, and higher radiation doses approached significance (P = .05). Induction chemotherapy was associated with fewer wound complications (P = .01). There were no significant differences in overall survival (P = .82), progression-free survival (P = .77), or regional relapse (P = .54) between groups. Positive ND findings were associated with diminished progression-free and overall survival. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that ND can be safely performed 12 weeks or more after CRT without adversely affecting surgical complications or survival variables.",cancer
"Hearing loss and complaint in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate occurrences of hearing loss and hearing complaints among patients with head and neck tumors who underwent radiotherapy. DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-two participants underwent evaluation, including 141 with head and neck tumors and 141 as an age-matched control group. The controls had never undergone oncological treatment that put their hearing at risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of audiological evaluation, including the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly questionnaire and pure-tone, speech, and immittance audiometry, and radiation dose received by the auditory system (based on the percentage of the external auditory canal included in the radiation field). RESULTS: We observed occurrences of hearing loss in 102 (72.3%) of the participants exposed to radiotherapy and 69 (48.9%) of the control group (P < .001). Hearing losses were mostly sensorineural and of mild degree, but those exposed to radiotherapy more frequently presented with severe and mixed-type hearing losses (P < .001). Of the participants exposed to radiotherapy, 19.1% had a severe handicap (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing radiotherapy in the head and neck region have a higher incidence of hearing loss and more severe hearing handicap.

"Surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma: is lobectomy enough? OBJECTIVE: To further understanding of treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). DESIGN: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database was searched for patients who had undergone surgery for PTC. SETTING: Areas covered by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population-based registries. PATIENTS: Patients who had undergone PTC surgery between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2001, were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the total 22,724 patients with PTC, 5964 patients underwent lobectomy. There were 2138 total and 471 disease-specific deaths. Controlling for tumor size, multivariate analysis revealed no survival difference between patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy and those who had undergone lobectomy. Increased tumor size, extrathyroidal extent, positive nodal status, and increased age displayed significantly worse DSS and OS (P < .001). Histologically, follicular PTC subtype did not affect DSS or OS. Patients who had received radioactive iodine had poorer DSS but improved OS. Patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy had poor DSS (hazard ratio, 4.48; 95% confidence interval, 3.30-6.06; P < .001) and OS (1.71; 1.42-2.07; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study compel us to reinvestigate the current PTC surgical recommendations of total thyroidectomy based on tumor size because this may not affect survival across all populations. In addition, the current use of external beam radiation therapy for the treatment of PTC should be reexamined.",cancer
"Laparoscopic vs open hepatic resection for benign and malignant tumors: An updated meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare laparoscopic hepatic resection (LHR) with open hepatic resection (OHR) for benign and malignant tumors. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant studies published between January 1, 1998, and May 1, 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Studies clearly documenting a comparison of LHR with OHR for benign and malignant neoplasms were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Operative and postoperative measures, resection margins, complications, and survival outcomes were evaluated. Weighted mean differences, relative risks, and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included in the meta-analysis. The HR of death for malignant tumors was significantly lower in the LHR group compared with the OHR group (HR, 0.64; P = .04). The HR of recurrence for malignant tumors was not significantly different between the 2 groups (HR, 0.79; P = .37). The LHR group had a lower operative blood loss (weighted mean difference, -161 mL; P < .001) and relative risk of total postoperative complications (relative risk, 0.40; P < .001). Duration of hospital stay, days of intravenous narcotic use, and days until oral intake were all significantly lower in the LHR group compared with the OHR group. Operative time between LHR and OHR was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic hepatic resection for malignant tumors is associated with a long-term survival that is at least comparable, if not superior, to OHR with no difference in disease recurrence. The use of LHR for benign and malignant tumors is a safe alternative to OHR with potential operative and postoperative benefits.",cancer
"Risk factors for invasive breast cancer when core needle biopsy shows ductal carcinoma in situ. HYPOTHESIS: A core needle biopsy (CNB) diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be associated with a final diagnosis of invasive cancer. Preoperative radiologic, clinical, and pathological features may identify patients at high risk of diagnostic upstaging, who may be appropriate candidates for sentinel node biopsy at initial surgery. DESIGN: Review of prospectively collected database. SETTING: Tertiary teaching referral hospital and a population-based breast screening center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2006, whose CNB findings showed DCIS or DCIS with microinvasion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Upstaging to invasive cancer. RESULTS: Eleven of 15 cases of DCIS with microinvasion (73.3%) and 65 of 375 cases of DCIS (17.3%) were upstaged to invasive cancer. Ten of 21 palpable lesions (47.6%) were found to have microinvasion. For impalpable DCIS, multivariate analysis showed that noncalcific mammographic features (mass, architectural distortion, or nonspecific density) (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.00 [1.02-3.94]), mammographic size of 20 mm or greater (2.80 [1.46-5.38]), and prolonged screening interval of 3 years or longer (4.41 [1.60-12.13]) were associated with upstaging. The DCIS grade on CNB was significant on univariate analysis (P = .04). The rate of upstaging increased with the number of significant factors present in a patient: 8.3% in patients with no risk factors, 20.8% in those with 1 risk factor, 39.6% in those with 2 risk factors, and 57.1% in those with 3 risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of upstaging can be estimated by using preoperative features in patients with DCIS on CNB. We propose a management algorithm that includes sentinel node biopsy for patients with DCIS who have microinvasion on CNB, palpable DCIS, 2 or more predictive factors, and planned total mastectomy.",cancer
"Surgeon subspecialty as a factor in improving long-term outcomes for gastric cancer: Twenty years of experience in Korea. BACKGROUND: The results of gastric cancer treatment have improved during the past 2 decades. In addition to early diagnosis, surgeon experience and subspecialty may influence long-term outcomes. This study analyzed data accumulated during the past 20 years regarding the impact of surgical subspecialty on gastric cancer prognosis. DESIGN: A 20-year, retrospective study. SETTING: Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul. PATIENTS: A total of 2797 patients admitted between 1984 and 2003 with surgically treated, pathologically confirmed, primary gastric adenocarcinoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Long-term survival. RESULTS: The incidence of total gastrectomy and the number of retrieved lymph nodes increased during the study period. In curative cases, 5-year survival improved from 66.1% to 76.6%, and this survival gain was restricted to stages I, III, and IV. A Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that age, sex, tumor location, type of resection, stage, and the interaction between period of study and surgical subspecialty were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: This large, long-term cohort study demonstrates that the management of gastric cancer has been largely successful, with favorable trends in prognostic factors. Successful outcomes are realized more often by gastric surgical specialists. Efforts must be made to improve the treatment of patients with stage II gastric cancer because the improvements in long-term results have plateaued.",cancer

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) during the early survivorship period as well as demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors associated with BCRL development. DESIGN: The Pathways Study, a prospective cohort study of breast cancer survivors with a mean follow-up time of 20.9 months. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical care program. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 997 women diagnosed from January 9, 2006, through October 15, 2007, with primary invasive breast cancer and who were at least 21 years of age at diagnosis, had no history of any cancer, and spoke English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical indication for BCRL as determined from outpatient or hospitalization diagnostic codes, outpatient procedural codes, and durable medical equipment orders. RESULTS: A clinical indication for BCRL was found in 133 women (13.3%), with a mean time to diagnosis of 8.3 months (range, 0.7-27.3 months). Being African American (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.72) or more educated (P for trend = .03) was associated with an increased risk of BCRL. Removal of at least 1 lymph node (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.07) was associated with an increased risk, yet no significant association was observed for type of lymph node surgery. Being obese at breast cancer diagnosis was suggestive of an elevated risk (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-2.31). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort study, BCRL occurs among a substantial proportion of early breast cancer survivors. Our findings agree with those of previous studies on the increased risk of BCRL with removal of lymph nodes and being obese, but they point to a differential risk according to race or ethnicity.",cancer
"Specific nail alterations in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: successful treatment with topical mechlorethamine. BACKGROUND: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can be associated with clinically significant nail alterations, the presentation of which can be protean and misleading. To date, only a few reports have demonstrated direct specific tumor infiltration of the nail bed, while little is known about the efficacy of topical treatments. OBSERVATIONS: We describe the case of a 93-year-old man presenting with Sezary syndrome who developed clinically significant nail alterations. Light microscopy studies and T-cell receptor rearrangement analysis demonstrated the presence of a specific lymphocytic infiltrate within the nail bed. The patient was given repeated courses of topical mechlorethamine, leading to a sustained complete remission of both skin and nail alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Specific nail involvement should be recognized and considered in all patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Topical mechlorethamine remains an attractive therapeutic option in cases of specific nail alterations, especially for situations in which systemic therapies are either not indicated or unlikely to be well tolerated.",cancer
"Thyrotoxicosis with pegylated interferon alfa-2b. BACKGROUND: Despite adequate surgery, a diagnosis of stage III melanoma carries a high risk of relapse, and hence mortality. Interferon alfa is the only treatment that has currently been shown to alter the natural history of the disease, delaying relapse-free survival, particularly in patients with micrometastatic disease. There is also recent evidence of a prognostic advantage conferred by the development of autoimmune conditions in patients receiving adjuvant interferon therapy. OBSERVATIONS: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with stage IIIa melanoma who was entered into the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer 18991 trial of 5-year adjuvant treatment with pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2b. The patient developed thyrotoxicosis 3 months after commencing treatment, which required treatment with propylthiouracil. The degree of thyrotoxicosis corresponded closely to the dose of peginterferon alfa-2b given. However, in this patient, the hyperthyroidism resolved spontaneously after 4 years when peginterferon treatment was still ongoing. Seven years following the initial diagnosis, the patient has not had disease relapse. CONCLUSION: Hyperthyroidism is less common than hypothyroidism as a consequence of interferon therapy, and this case is atypical in that it resolved spontaneously during interferon therapy but is in accordance with the recent evidence of a positive association between interferon-associated autoimmunity and prognosis.",cancer
"Dermoscopic island: a new descriptor for thin melanoma. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and the features of the dermoscopic island (DI) in melanocytic lesions and to assess its specificity for the diagnosis of melanoma. Dermoscopy improves the diagnostic accuracy of melanoma, but only a few dermoscopic descriptors specific for thin melanomas have been identified. We defined a new descriptor, the dermoscopic island, a well-circumscribed area showing a uniform dermoscopic pattern that differs from the rest of the pigmented lesion. DESIGN: Dermoscopic images of 96 in situ melanomas, 266 invasive melanomas, and 612 dermoscopic atypical nevi were evaluated to establish the presence and the main pattern of the DI. Also, clinical and histologic characteristics were analyzed. SETTING: Dermoscopic images were collected from lesions excised between 2003 and 2008 at the Department of Dermatology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Specificity and odds ratio for melanoma; dermoscopic and histologic characteristics of lesions with a DI. RESULTS: The DI was present in 10.4% of in situ melanomas, 4.1% of invasive melanomas, and 3.1% of dermoscopic atypical nevi. The odds ratio for melanoma was 1.922, and specificity was 96.9%. Invasive melanomas with a DI were thinner than those lacking this descriptor. In addition, more than half of the melanomas with a DI arose on a nevus. The DI appeared mainly reticular on a reticular background. CONCLUSION: The DI is characteristic of thin melanoma arising in a nevus; thus, it can be considered a potential early sign of transformation of a nevus into a melanoma.",cancer
"Environmental cues to UV radiation and personal sun protection in outdoor winter recreation. OBJECTIVE: To predict the prevalence of UV radiation (hereinafter, UV) at North American ski resorts using temporal, seasonal, altitudinal, and meteorological factors and associate UV with a set of adult sun protection behaviors. DESIGN: Ultraviolet radiation observations and cross-sectional survey of adults on sun protection were collected. SETTING: Data were collected at 32 high-altitude ski areas located in western North America from 2001 through 2003. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 3937 adult skiers or snowboarders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of direct, reflected, and diffuse UV were performed at 487 measurement points using handheld meters and combined with self-reported and observed sun protection assessed for adults interviewed on chairlifts. RESULTS: The strongest predictors of UV were temporal proximity to noon, deviation from winter solstice, and clear skies. By contrast, altitude and latitude had more modest associations with UV and temperature had a small positive relationship with UV. Guest sun safety was inconsistently associated with UV: UV was positively related to adults wearing more sunscreen, reapplying it after 2 hours, and wearing protective eyewear, but fewer adults exhibited many of the other sun protection behaviors, such as wearing hats and protective clothing or using lip balm, on days when UV was elevated. Guests took more sun safety precautions on clear-sky days but took steps to maintain body warmth on inclement days. CONCLUSIONS: In future sun safety promotions, adults should be encouraged to wear sunscreen on cloudy days because UV is still high and conditions can change rapidly. They need reminders to rely more on season and time of day when judging UV and the need for sun safety.",cancer
"Early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma: a sign of impending ulceration. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma (IH) and ulceration. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A case series of 11 infants with early white discoloration of IH are described. An additional 55 infants with IH, aged 3 months, were evaluated retrospectively from a photograph archive to further explore the relationship between early white discoloration and presence or development of ulceration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics and hemangioma size, location, and subtype are documented. Sensitivity and specificity of white discoloration in relationship to ulceration are estimated. RESULTS: Ten of the 11 infants in the case series were girls (90%); all IHs were of segmental or indeterminate subtype. Average age at first ulceration was 2.6 months, with average age at healing 5.2 months. No intervention halted progression of ulceration. Of the 55 additional 3-month-old infants, 14 had white discoloration and 12 of these 14 had or developed ulceration (86%). When the hemangioma was either white or slightly white, sensitivity for predicting ulceration was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-1.00), with a specificity of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.51-0.81). In contrast, in infants with either slightly white or no white discoloration, the sensitivity for not developing ulceration was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96), with a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.83-0.99), suggesting that a lack of substantial white discoloration early in infancy indicates low risk of ulceration. CONCLUSION: Early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma is highly suggestive of impending ulceration.",cancer
"Uncertainty in the perioperative management of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma among Mohs surgeons. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Mohs surgeons' management of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HRCSCC) is uniform regarding radiologic nodal staging (RNS) and adjuvant radiation therapy (ART). DESIGN: A survey study of randomly selected, fellowship-trained Mohs surgeons. SETTING: An academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: American College of Mohs Surgery members who responded to an e-mail invitation completed either a survey regarding management of HRCSCC (n=117) or SCC with perineural invasion (PNI) (n=118). Participants totaled approximately 25% of the American College of Mohs Surgery membership. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Percentage of patients with HRCSCC referred for RNS, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), or ART over the preceding 12 months; (2) top factors leading surgeons to consider RNS, SLNB, or ART; and (3) acceptance of ART for clinical scenarios of various degrees of PNI. RESULTS: Most respondents cited PNI and in-transit metastasis as top factors leading to consideration of RNS, SLNB, or ART. Otherwise, there was no consensus regarding use of, or indications for, RNS, SLNB, or ART. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of consistency between experts indicates that there is equipoise regarding indications for RNS and ART in HRCSCC. There is also wide variation in RNS and ART practices among Mohs surgeons who are specifically trained to manage HRCSCC. Clinical trials should therefore be conducted in these areas as there is no clear standard of care.",cancer
"The essence of senescence. Almost half a century after the first reports describing the limited replicative potential of primary cells in culture, there is now overwhelming evidence for the existence of ""cellular senescence"" in vivo. It is being recognized as a critical feature of mammalian cells to suppress tumorigenesis, acting alongside cell death programs. Here, we review the various features of cellular senescence and discuss their contribution to tumor suppression. Additionally, we highlight the power and limitations of the biomarkers currently used to identify senescent cells in vitro and in vivo.",cancer
"The value of 99mTc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT in predicting survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT has been reported as a useful tool for the evaluation of glioma proliferation. In the present study, we set out to investigate the prognostic value of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. METHODS: We prospectively studied 18 patients (13 men, 5 women; mean age +/- SD, 60.8 +/- 7.79 y) who were operated on for glioblastoma multiforme. All patients underwent preoperative (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT, and surgical excision was performed within a week after SPECT. All patients received postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: By calculating the lesion-to-normal (L/N) (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake ratio, we found that patients with an L/N ratio of more than 4.7 had significantly worse survival than did patients with an L/N ratio of 4.7 or less. Furthermore, patients with a Karnofsky Performance Score more than 90 had a significantly better survival rate. Although patients with near-total tumor resection who were younger than 60 y survived longer, the difference did not reach statistical significance. In the multivariate analysis, (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake and Karnofsky Performance Score were identified as factors with independent prognostic power. CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT may be an independent prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Further larger studies are needed to verify these results.",cancer
"Early repeated 18F-FDG PET scans during neoadjuvant chemoradiation fail to predict histopathologic response or survival benefit in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. This study evaluated the role of (18)F-FDG PET as an early predictor of histopathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus undergoing multimodal therapy. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus underwent pretreatment and an intratreatment (18)F-FDG PET scan in the second week of a 6-wk regimen of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Histopathologic response and overall survival were correlated with percentage change in (18)F-FDG uptake (%Deltamaximum standardized uptake value [%DeltaSUVmax]). RESULTS: In 16 patients (43%), treatment induced a histopathologic response (<10% viable tumor cells), which was associated with a significant (P < 0.05) survival benefit. The optimal reduction in (18)F-FDG uptake, which separated histopathologic responders and nonresponders, was a -26.4% DeltaSUVmax (receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis). At this separation, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) were 62.5%, 71.4%, 62.5%, 71.4%, and 67.4%, respectively, for intratreatment (18)F-FDG PET scans. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of (18)F-FDG PET responders (>26.4% reduction in SUVmax), compared with (18)F-FDG PET nonresponders (<26.4% reduction in SUVmax), revealed no survival benefit for responders (P = 0.6812). CONCLUSION: The %DeltaSUVmax during the second week of induction chemoradiation did not correlate either with histopathologic response or with survival. Our results show that, in contrast to published reports on neoadjuvant chemotherapy, combined chemoradiotherapy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus lowers the predictive accuracy of early repeated (18)F-FDG PET in identifying histopathologic responders and those with chances for increased survival below clinically applicable levels.",cancer
"Repeatability of metabolically active volume measurements with 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT PET in non-small cell lung cancer. In addition to tumor size measurements with CT, there is a need for quantitative measurements of metabolic active volumes, possibly adding to tracer uptake measurements in oncologic response evaluation with PET. The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic volume test-retest variability in (18)F-FDG and 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) PET studies for various commonly used volumes of interest (VOIs) and the dependence of that variability on lesion size and relative radiotracer uptake. METHODS: Twenty non-small cell lung cancer patients were scanned twice with (18)F-FDG (n = 11) or (18)F-FLT (n = 9). VOIs were defined on images reconstructed with normalization- and attenuation-weighted ordered-subset expectation maximization using 4 isocontours (A41%, A50%, and A70% thresholds, adapted for local background, and 50% threshold, uncorrected for background). Statistical analysis comprised intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: In the (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT groups, 34 and 20 lesions, respectively, were analyzed. Median volumes at the A50% threshold were 3.31 and 2.19 mL (interquartile range, 1.91-8.90 and 1.52-7.27 mL) for (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0.9, with the exception of the A70%-based metabolic volumes for (18)F-FLT. For lesions greater than 4.2 mL, repeatability coefficients (RCs = 1.96 x SD) of the percentage difference ranged from 22% to 37% for (18)F-FDG and from 39% to 73% for (18)F-FLT, depending on the VOI method being used. Repeatability was better for larger tumors, but there was no dependence on absolute uptake (standardized uptake value). CONCLUSION: Results indicate that changes of greater than 37% for (18)F-FDG and greater than 73% for (18)F-FLT (1.96 x SD) for lesions with A50% metabolic volumes greater than 4.2 mL represent a biologic effect. For smaller lesions (A50% VOI < 4.2 mL), an absolute change of 1.0 and 0.9 mL for (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT, respectively, is biologically relevant. Considering the balance between the success rate of automatic tumor delineation and repeatability of metabolic volume, a 50% threshold with correction for local background activity (A50%) seems optimal among the VOI methods evaluated.",cancer
Molecular mechanisms of bone 18F-NaF deposition. There is renewed interest in (18)F-NaF bone imaging with PET or PET/CT.

"Improvement of early 18F-FDG PET interpretation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: importance of the reference background. This study investigated whether the reference background above which a residual mass is considered positive in the International Harmonization Project criteria should be modified for early (18)F-FDG PET evaluation. METHODS: In 92 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured on post-cycle 2 PET in the most intense residual mass (or, in the case of negative PET findings, in the area of most intense tumor uptake before therapy), in the mediastinal blood pool (MBP) and the liver, as potential reference background tissues. RESULTS: With MBP as a reference (SUVmax, 2.0 +/- 0.6), PET was unable to distinguish early responders from nonresponders. In contrast, with liver as a reference (SUVmax, 2.5 +/- 0.7), 2-y progression-free survival was significantly different between patients with PET-negative findings (81.8% [95% confidence interval, 71%-93%]) and patients with PET-positive findings (51.8% [95% confidence interval, 35%-69%], P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: When assessing early response, particularly in risk-adapted therapeutic trials, it seems preferable to refer to a background tissue (liver) with a higher level of uptake than that of current international criteria (MBP) which were designed for end-of-treatment evaluation.",cancer
"18F-FDG PET/CT for the prediction and detection of local recurrence after radiofrequency ablation of malignant lung lesions. The utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for response assessment in malignant lung tumors treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and for the detection and prediction of local recurrence was investigated. METHODS: Between December 17, 2003, and April 9, 2008, 68 consecutive patients (mean age, 68 y) with 94 pulmonary lesions, including metastases (n = 38) and primary lung cancers (n = 44), underwent RFA. Because of inadequate imaging follow-up in 12 patients, only 82 lesions were analyzed (CT scans, n = 82; (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans, n = 62). The median follow-up was 25 mo (range, 12-66 mo). A baseline study was defined as (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed no more than 3 mo before RFA. The first postablation scan was defined as PET/CT performed between 1 and 4 mo after RFA; additional follow-up studies were obtained in some cases between 6 and 12 mo after RFA. The unidimensional maximum diameter of the lesion was recorded on a pretherapy diagnostic CT scan or on the CT component of a pretherapy (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan, whichever was obtained most recently, using lung windows. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) were recorded for all lesions imaged by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. (18)F-FDG uptake patterns on post-RFA scans were classified as favorable or unfavorable. Survival and recurrence probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Uni- and multivariate analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Before RFA, factors predicting greater local recurrence-free survival included initial lesion size less than 3 cm (P = 0.01) and SUV less than 8 (P = 0.02), although the latter was not an independent predictor in multivariate analysis. Treated metastases recurred less often than treated primary lung cancers (P = 0.03). Important post-RFA factors that related to reduced recurrence-free survival included an unfavorable uptake pattern (P < 0.01), post-RFA SUV (P < 0.01), and an increase in SUV over time after ablation (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters on both preablation and postablation scans may predict local recurrence in patients treated with RFA for lung metastases and primary lung cancers.",cancer
"Culture of omentum-induced regenerating liver yielded hepatocyte-committed stem cells. Earlier we showed that when omentum, activated by inert particles, is allowed to fuse to a wedge cut in the liver, it induces stem cell proliferation in the liver resulting in massive liver regeneration. Here, we attempt to culture stem cells from the omentum-induced regenerating liver tissue. Cells from regenerating liver tissue were harvested and cultured. Cultured cells were characterized by immune staining, fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis, growth factor assay, in vitro differentiation, and their ability to engraft to injured sites in vivo. Culture yielded cells with a mesenchymal stem cell phenotype that could be maintained in culture indefinitely. These cells, called regenerating liver stem cells, expressed both adult and embryonic stem cell markers, secreted high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, and expressed albumin. When grown on matrigel in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor, these cells differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells in culture, but they did not differentiate to adipogenic and osteogenic lineages when grown in specific differentiation medium. The differentiated cells expressed alpha-fetoprotein and secreted high levels of albumin and urea. After systemic injection, the undifferentiated cells engrafted only to the injured sites in the liver and not to the normal areas of the liver. In conclusion, omentum-induced regenerating liver yields hepatocyte-committed stem cells in culture. Such cells could prove to be useful in cell transplantation therapies.",cancer
"Higher levels of GATA3 predict better survival in women with breast cancer. The GATA family members are zinc finger transcription factors involved in cell differentiation and proliferation. GATA3 in particular is necessary for mammary gland maturation, and its loss has been implicated in breast cancer development. Our goal was to validate the ability of GATA3 expression to predict survival in breast cancer patients. Protein expression of GATA3 was analyzed on a high-density tissue microarray consisting of 242 cases of breast cancer. We associated GATA3 expression with patient outcomes and clinicopathologic variables. Expression of GATA3 was significantly increased in breast cancer, in situ lesions, and hyperplastic tissue compared with normal breast tissue. GATA3 expression decreased with increasing tumor grade. Low GATA3 expression was a significant predictor of disease-related death in all patients, as well as in subgroups of estrogen receptor-positive or low-grade patients. In addition, low GATA3 expression correlated with increased tumor size and estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity. GATA3 is an important predictor of disease outcome in breast cancer patients. This finding has been validated in a diverse set of populations. Thus, GATA3 expression has utility as a prognostic indicator in breast cancer.",cancer
"Expression of master regulatory genes controlling skeletal development in benign cartilage and bone forming tumors. Recent progress in skeletal molecular biology has led to the clarification of the transcriptional mechanisms of chondroblastic and osteoblastic lineage differentiation. Three master transcription factors-Sox9, Runx2, and Osterix-were shown to play an essential role in determining the skeletal progenitor cells' fate. The present study evaluates the expression of these factors in 4 types of benign bone tumors-chondromyxoid fibroma, chondroblastoma, osteoid osteoma, and osteoblastoma-using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays. Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma showed strong nuclear expression of Osterix and Runx2. In contrast, only a few chondroblastomas showed positive nuclear expression of Osterix. Strong nuclear expression of Sox9 was detected in all chondroblastomas, whereas nearly half of the osteoblastomas showed focal weak cytoplasmic expression of Sox9.",cancer
"The epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in relation to pelvic lymph node metastasis and survival in early-stage cervical cancer. The objective of this study is to correlate the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) components with clinical behavior of early-stage cervical cancer. Tissue samples of 336 consecutive Federation of International Gynecologists and Obstetricians stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients all treated primarily by radical surgery were collected. Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were prospectively obtained during standard treatment and follow-up. As representatives for the EGFR pathway, expression of EGFR, pEGFR, PTEN, pAKT, and pERK was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Positive immunostaining was observed for EGFR in 32.1%, for pEGFR in 21.0%, for PTEN in 38.3%, for pAKT in 5.3%, and for pERK in 4.3% of tumor samples. Positive EGFR immunostaining was associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (odds ratio [OR], 7.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.38-16.23, P < .001), negative pEGFR immunostaining with poor differentiation (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.73, P = .004), and negative PTEN immunostaining with metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.90, P = .019). In multivariate analysis, only pelvic lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio, 6.11; 95% CI, 3.46-10.77, P < .001) and poor differentiation (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.12-3.26, P = .018) were related to disease-specific survival. In early-stage cervical cancer, loss of PTEN expression is associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis, suggesting PTEN to be one of the tumor suppressor genes affecting pelvic lymph node metastasis. However, expression of EGFR pathway components does not appear to have prognostic impact in surgically treated early-stage cervical cancer.",cancer
"Significant association between polymorphism of the erythropoietin gene promoter and myelodysplastic syndrome. BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) may be induced by certain mutagenic environmental or chemotherapeutic toxins; however, the role of susceptibility genes remains unclear. The G/G genotype of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1617640 in the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased EPO expression. We examined the association of rs1617640 genotype with MDS. METHODS: We genotyped the EPO rS1617640 SNP in 189 patients with MDS, 257 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 106 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 97 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 353 with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 95 healthy controls. RESULTS: The G/G genotype was significantly more common in MDS patients (47/187; 25.1%) than in controls (6/95; 6.3%) or in patients with other leukemias (101/813; 12.4%) (all P < 0.001). Individuals with the G/G genotype were more likely than those with other genotypes to have MDS (odd ratio = 4.98; 95% CI = 2.04-12.13). Clinical and follow up data were available for 112 MDS patients and 186 AML patients. There was no correlation between EPO promoter genotype and response to therapy or overall survival in MDS or AML. In the MDS group, the GG genotype was significantly associated with shorter complete remission duration, as compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.03). Time to neutrophils recovery after therapy was significantly longer in MDS patients with the G/G genotype (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a strong association between the rs1617640 G/G genotype and MDS. Further studies are warranted to investigate the utility of screening for this marker in individuals exposed to environmental toxins or chemotherapy.",cancer
"Therapeutic molecular targets in human chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcomas are malignant cartilage tumours. They are poorly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Treatment is usually limited to surgical resection; however, survival of patients with high-grade chondrosarcoma is poor, even with wide surgical resection. Induction of apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells, either directly or by enhancement of the response to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation, may be a route by which outcome can be improved. In this article, we review potential molecular targets that regulate chondrocyte apoptosis and discuss the experimental evidence for their utility.",cancer
"Obtusilactone A and (-)-sesamin induce apoptosis in human lung cancer cells by inhibiting mitochondrial Lon protease and activating DNA damage checkpoints. Several compounds from Cinnamomum kotoense show anticancer activities. However, the detailed mechanisms of most compounds from C. kotoense remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of obtusilactone A (OA) and (-)-sesamin in lung cancer. Our results show that human Lon is upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, and downregulation of Lon triggers caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. Through enzyme-based screening, we identified two small-molecule compounds, obtusilactone A (OA) and (-)-sesamin from C. kotoense, as potent Lon protease inhibitors. Obtusilactone A and (-)-sesamin interact with Ser855 and Lys898 residues in the active site of the Lon protease according to molecular docking analysis. Thus, we suggest that cancer cytotoxicity of the compounds is partly due to the inhibitory effects on Lon protease. In addition, the compounds are able to cause DNA double-strand breaks and activate checkpoints. Treatment with OA and (-)-sesamin induced p53-independent DNA damage responses in NSCLC cells, including G(1) /S checkpoint activation and apoptosis, as evidenced by phosphorylation of checkpoint proteins (H2AX, Nbs1, and Chk2), caspase-3 cleavage, and sub-G(1) accumulation. In conclusion, OA and (-)-sesamin act as both inhibitors of human mitochondrial Lon protease and DNA damage agents to activate the DNA damage checkpoints as well induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells. These dual functions open a bright avenue to develop more selective chemotherapy agents to overcome chemoresistance and sensitize cancer cells to other chemotherapeutics.",cancer
"Phase I/II study of a 3-week cycle of irinotecan and S-1 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The combination of an oral fluoropyrimidine derivative, S-1, and irinotecan is expected to be a promising regimen for advanced colorectal cancer. This study was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of irinotecan combined with S-1 in a 3-week cycle regimen and to observe the safety and efficacy for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer. Eighty milligrams per m(2) of S-1 was given orally for 14 consecutive days and escalated doses of irinotecan were administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks in the phase I trial. Forty patients were treated at the RD during the phase II trial. Forty-three patients were enrolled between February 2005 and March 2007. The dose-limiting toxicity was diarrhea and abdominal pain. The MTD of irinotecan was 100 mg/m(2) and the RD was determined to be 80 mg/m(2) of irinotecan combined with 80 mg/m(2) of S-1. The phase II trial showed that 22 of 40 patients achieved a complete or partial response and eight had stable disease. The overall response rate was 55.0%. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 6.7 and 21 months, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths. The main toxicities were leukopenia, neutropenia, anorexia and diarrhea. This study suggests the combination of irinotecan and S-1 repeated every 3 weeks is tolerable and effective for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer.",cancer

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised incidence and mortality ratios. RESULTS: Compared with the total Queensland population, Indigenous Queenslanders had a lower overall incidence of cancer (standardised incidence ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.75-0.82), but a higher incidence of some of the more fatal cancer types. Overall cancer mortality was higher (standardised mortality ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.28-1.45) and similar to rates for Indigenous people in other Australian states. CONCLUSION: Cancer rates for Indigenous Queenslanders, a mostly urbanised population, are similar to rates for Indigenous Australians mostly living in remote areas.",cancer
"Twenty-five years of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in Western Australia: how do we compare? OBJECTIVES: To compare survival among the subgroup of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who were treated at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) in Perth, Western Australia, over 25 years under 15 consecutive protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) with survival for the entire cohort of children in multiple centres treated under CCG protocols in that period; and to highlight the benefits of membership of a large cooperative research group conducting multicentre randomised controlled trials. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Retrospective review of the outcomes of all 311 children with newly diagnosed ALL treated at PMH between 1983 and 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 4-year event-free survival; and 10-year overall survival. RESULTS: Four-year event-free survival for the entire PMH cohort increased from 66% (SE, 6%) for 1983-1987 to 88% (SE, 6%) for 2002-2005, while overall survival over the same period improved from 78% (SE, 5%) to 94% (SE, 4%). Comparisons of outcomes of children treated at PMH with those of the entire CCG cohort, protocol by protocol, revealed similar outcomes. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of children treated at PMH over the 25-year period are equivalent to those of the larger CCG cohort.",cancer
"Symptoms, investigations and management of patients with cancer of the oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction in Australia. OBJECTIVE: To document presenting symptoms, investigations and management for Australian patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GOJAC) and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of a population-based sample of 1100 Australian patients aged 18-79 years with histologically confirmed oesophageal cancer diagnosed in 2002-2005, using data from cancer registries and treatment centres, supplemented with clinical information collected through medical record review in 2006-2007 and mortality information collected in 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of primary symptoms, and staging investigations and treatment modalities used. RESULTS: The primary presenting symptom was dysphagia, which was self-reported by 41%, 39% and 48% of patients with OAC, GOJAC and OSCC, respectively. Less common symptoms were reflux, chest pain, bleeding and weight loss. All patients underwent endoscopy, most had a staging computed tomography scan (OAC 93%, GOJAC 95% and OSCC 93%), and about half had positron emission tomography scans (OAC 51%, GOJAC 44% and OSCC 42%). Pretreatment tumour stage was reported in 25% of records, and could be derived from results of investigations in a further 23%, but the remaining half lacked sufficient information to ascribe a pretreatment stage. Curative treatments were attempted for 60% of OAC, 88% of GOJAC and 65% of OSCC patients. Surgery was performed on 52% of OAC, 83% of GOJAC and 41% of OSCC patients. About two-thirds of surgical patients received additional therapies. CONCLUSIONS: With anticipated increases in oesophageal cancer incidence, the resources required to diagnose and manage patients with oesphageal cancer are also likely to rise. Our data provide a baseline from which to plan for the future care of patients with cancers of the oesophagus.",cancer
"Obesity and microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with higher Body Mass Index (BMI) might have more microvascular invasion (MVI) in their tumors. METHODS: Records from 138 consecutive patients who underwent surgery at Columbia University Medical Center from January 1, 2002 to January 9, 2008 were evaluated. RESULTS: 40 patients (29%) had MVI, including 14% with BMI <25, 31% with BMI = 25-30, and 40% with BMI >30 (p = .05). However, only maximum alpha-fetoprotein was significantly associated with overall mortality in a Cox model. CONCLUSIONS: MVI was associated with obesity. A better understanding of the mechanism of this association may lead to interventions for the treatment and prevention of HCC.",cancer
Huge endometriosis presenting like an ovarian tumor: CT appearance. A 32-year-old female with a clinical history of abdominal swelling underwent CT of the abdomen. A huge biloculated cystic mass with a mural nodule in the abdominal and pelvic region was seen. The lesion showed slightly homogeneous enhancement. The imaging findings suggested an ovarian tumor. Histopathological evaluation after surgical resection revealed that the lesion was a bilateral ovarian endometriosis.,cancer
"Ovarian torsion; early diagnosis by MRI to prevent irreversible damage. BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of ovarian torsion can help prevent irreversible damage to the adnexal structures in women desiring to maintain fertility. CASE: The patient was transferred by ambulance for a six-hour history of severe lower abdominal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral enlarged ovaries measuring 5 x 6 cm (right) and 4 x 5 cm (left) with a right twisted and thickened peduncle. Ultrasonography failed to detect the peduncle changes. At surgery, the right adnexa was twisted 180 degrees in a clockwise direction with no findings suggestive of gangrenous change, hemorrhagic infarction or ischemic change. Detorsion of the twisted ovary was performed. CONCLUSION: Detection of tube torsion at MRI may be useful in the preoperative evaluation for surgical detorsion of twisted adnexa encountered in enlarged ovaries.",cancer
"Pregnancy and adnexal torsion: analysis of 20 cases. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile, management and outcome of pregnancy complicated by adnexal torsion. METHODS: All pregnancy cases complicated by adnexal torsion admitted between January 2001 and January 2009 were analyzed. RESULTS: The total number of pregnant cases was 20. Age range of pregnant women with adnexal torsion was 18 to 42 years. Of these cases 70% were seen in the first and second trimester. Seventy percent of cases were operated by the laparotomy route and 30% by laparoscopy. Salpingo-oophorectomy was performed in 70% of cases and detorsion in 30% of cases. Histopathologic examinations revealed five patients (25%) had serous cystadenoma, four patients (20%) mucinous cystadenoma, six patients (20%) dermoid cyst and five patients (25%) hemorrhagic cyst. CONLUSIONS: Adnexal torsion as a differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in pregnancy should be considered and we recommend early surgical treatment that will save the adnexa.",cancer
"Is insulin-dependent diabetes and obesity a predisposition for endometrial and pancreatic carcinoma? Among 178 patients operated for endometrial carcinoma during a five-year period, 17 were re-operated at the Institute of Surgery (9.5%) because of pancreatic head carcinoma. The frequency of insulin-dependent diabetes was pointed out in patients-- 28% of those who were first diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma. Moreover in the same group diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma, we found 17 to have pancreatic carcinoma, and among those there were 12 cases that had diabetes (70.58%).",cancer
"Serum retinol-binding protein-4 levels in polycystic ovary syndrome patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in-vitro fertilization cycle. AIMS: To determine serum retinol-binding rotein 4 (RBP-4) levels in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for an in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycle and the possible correlation to COH variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 11 consecutive PCOS patients undergoing our routine IVF flexible multidose gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-antagonist protocol. Blood was drawn three times during the COH cycle: (1) day 1 or 2 of menstruation, and prior to gonadotropin administration (Day-S) (Day-S); (2) day of or prior to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration (Day-hCG); and (3) day of ovum pick-up (Day-OPU). Levels of estradiol and serum RBP-4 were compared among the three time points. Serum RBP-4 was measured with a commercial immunoassay. RESULTS: Results showed significantly lower levels of serum RBP-4 on Day-OPU and Day-hCG than on Day-S. Though significant correlations were observed between serum RBP-4 and body mass index, fasting glucose or glucose to insulin ratio, no correlations were found between serum RBP-4 and IVF treatment variables or pregnancy rate. CONCLUSION: While serum RBP-4 decreases during COH for IVF, there is apparently no correlation of serum RBP-4 levels with IVF treatment variables or outcome.",cancer
"Groin recurrence following stage IA squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva with negative nodes on superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Stage IA vulvar cancer with a depth of stromal invasion less than 1 mm is generally managed by wide local excision alone since there is less than 1% risk of lymph node involvement. CASE: A 62-year-old patient was admitted to a university hospital with a suspicious vulvar lesion. RESULTS: We present the first case of inguinal node and a possible contralateral pubic ramus recurrence following bilateral superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy and wide local resection for Stage 1A vulvar cancer. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that extended radical surgery provides a better overall survival or reduces recurrence rate in Stage 1A vulvar carcinomas. Conservative vulvar resection and sentinel node dissection seem to be a rational choice. Nevertheless the disease may recur in the inguinal areas and frequently be lethal, therefore close surveillance and early attempts to treat the recurrent disease before infection and inflammation ensues should be the aim of current treatment strategies.",cancer
"Chemotherapy with low-dose bevacizumab and carboplatin in the treatment of a patient with recurrent cervical cancer. Management of patients with recurrent or advanced cervical cancer is a challenge. Concurrent chemotherapy has become the mainstay of treatment and platinum remains the most effective single agent. Combinations of other agents have not demonstrated significant advantages. The application of angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab, an antibody inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor, in metastatic or advanced cervical cancer remains to be evaluated. We present the case of a patient with platinum-resistant recurrent cervical cancer treated with low-dose bevacizumab and carboplatin, with resultant improved disease progression and tolerable toxicity profiles.",cancer
"Serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma incidentally discovered in a 29-year-old patient: case report. This is a review of a case of Stage I A serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma in a 29-year-old patient. The patient had no symptoms of illness. She underwent a surgical intervention because of cysts in both of her ovaries. By histopathological examination of the tissue sample taken during the surgical intervention, it was discovered that the patient suffered from a serous cystadenocarcinoma in her left ovary. Five years after the surgical intervention there have been no symptoms of relapse.",cancer
"Ovarian carcinomatosis presenting as bilateral inguinal hernia: a brief report. The differential diagnosis for what may seem an inguinal hernia may be complex, as lateral pain may be of many types of origin. We report the case of a 48-year-old female patient who presented with a history of painful, progressively protruding soft bulging masses over the bilateral inguinal area and a 20-year history of head cancer and hepatitis B virus. Pathological analysis, gynecological ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography scan were required to make final determination. Final diagnosis was Stage IV ovarian carcinomatosis, which responded to chemotherapy. Initial diagnosis of inguinal hernia should not rule out other potential diagnoses, particularly in complex cases with other risk factors.",cancer
"Liver resection for metastases arising from recurrent granulosa cell tumour of the ovary--a case series. Ovarian granulosa cell tumours (GCT) occur rarely and represent 2-3% of all ovarian tumours. Regarded as tumours with low malignant potential and renowned for late recurrences, these tumours occasionally metastasize to the liver. We present our experience with three patients who underwent secondary cytoreductive surgery including liver resection for recurrence of the disease resulting in greatly improved quality of life and disease-free interval.",cancer
"Ovarian metastasis of a primary renal cell carcinoma: case report and review of literature. Ovarian metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are very rare, with only 23 cases reported in the literature. We report a case of 54-year-old women who developed bilateral ovarian metastasis 39 months after diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was carried out. Subsequently she was treated with sunitinib and her disease stabilized. She is still alive four years after diagnosis of the renal primary, and disease has stabilized on sunitinib. We conclude that, although rare, the possibility of metastatic RCC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of clear cell tumors of the ovary. Due to therapeutic and prognostic implications, it is very important to differentiate if the tumor is a primary ovarian tumor or a metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma. Early diagnosis of this rare metastatic tumor results in prompt treatment and prolonged patient survival.",cancer
Three-dimensional power Doppler color ultrasonographic features of a minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. A case of minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the cervix in a 34-year-old female is presented. The ultrasonographic and three-dimensional power Doppler color studies revealed a nodular cervical lesion with vascularization more prominent in the center of the nodule but also present at the periphery. The imaging diagnosis was suggestive of a myoma but with more vascularization than a conventional one.,cancer
"Metastatic and recurrent adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix: a long-term survival of 16 years. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Recurrent metastatic adenocarcinoma of the cervix is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Treatment options for recurrent disease are limited and cure is extremely rare. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 43-year-old patient with Stage IB adenocarcinoma of the cervix. She had multiple metastatic recurrence episodes salvaged with several radical surgeries, external and intraoperative irradiation, and chemotherapy over a survival period of 16 years. CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term multi-modal salvage treatment may achieve longer survival in rare cases with recurrent metastatic adenocarcinoma of the cervix.",cancer
"A benign metastasizing leiomyoma involving a nodule in the pulmonary artery: case and literature review. Benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) is a rare disease defined as a primary benign uterine tumor with ""metastatic"" lesions preferentially occurring in the lung, pelvis and lymph nodes. There are few reports about local recurrence after initial surgery. We report a case of a BML with local recurrence and metastasis growing into the wall of the left pulmonary artery, diagnosed 11 years after initial hysterectomy. A 55-year-old woman complaining of abdominal discomfort, heaviness and asthenia was admitted to our hospital for investigation of a voluminous uterine mass with high vascularization and three pulmonary nodules. The resection of the mass by laparotomy was complicated by uncontrolled severe hemorrhage due to vascular proliferation, requiring multiple transfusions, packing the cavity and postoperative uterine artery embolization. Three months later the patient underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy with the aim of removing the largest pulmonary nodule, a nodule a located in the lingular branch of the left pulmonary artery. The comparison of hysterectomy and lobectomy pieces showed a similar aspect, leading thus to the diagnosis of BML. Awareness of this rare entity should potentially avoid under-diagnosis and difficulties due to hemorrhage during surgery.",cancer
"Evaluation of preoperative diagnosis with results of histopathological examinations of ovarian tumors in women of reproductive age. Ovarian tumors are the most frequent lesions encountered by gynecologists. Ovarian carcinoma most often develops asymptomatically and until now no sufficient screening diagnostic methods have been developed, which is why various diagnostic methods are being tried concurrently to increase diagnostic sensitivity. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the compliance of the preoperative diagnoses with the results of histopathological examinations of ovarian tumors and to determine the usefulness of simultaneous application of gynecological, ultrasonographic, and Doppler examinations together with determination of CA-125 antigen in the diagnostic process of ovarian tumors. The study comprised a group of 250 women in reproductive age who were operated on for tumors of the ovary. Results of histopathological examinations were compared with the preoperative diagnosis based on the above-mentioned examinations and prognostic indicators: sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive prediction value as well as accuracy were determined. The results showed that combining the four diagnostic methods is a useful research panel in the preoperative diagnostic process of ovarian tumors and makes selecting the appropriate procedure and surgical treatment viable.",cancer
"Intestinal-type metaplasia in the original squamous epithelium of the cervix. There have been a number of reports on cervical carcinomas, both invasive and intraepithelial (CIN III), indicating the presence of intracellular mucins in the absence of glandular differentiation. Yet, the expression of such cells in the normal/original squamous epithelium of the cervix remains unexplored. We investigated the presence of mucin-distended goblet cells at this site, after examining retrospectively normal cervices from 250 hysterectomy specimens. Goblet cells were detected in 3.2% (8/250) of the cervices examined using haematoxylin and eosin stained sections and confirmed by mucin histochemistry: alcian blue (AB) pH 2.5, periodic acid-Schiff reaction with and without diastase digestion (PAS-d, PAS) and the combined AB/PAS. Additional sections were stained with Diazo and Masson-Fontana for argentaffin granules and Grimelius for argyrophil cells, but were all negative and no other cell types were identified. It is believed that this incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia is an acquired change in the cervix, derived from multi-potential stem cells of Mullerian duct origin.",cancer
"Distribution of HPV genotypes in uterine cervical lesions among the Uighur women in Xinjiang province of China. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of HPV genotypes in uterine cervical lesions of Uighur women in the Xinjiang province of China. METHODS: A total of 223 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cervical tissue specimens from Uighur patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were analyzed with HPV specific general primer pairs MY09/11 by PCR amplification and HPV chip. RESULTS: Among 223 cases, HPV-positive samples accounted for 58.7% (131/223). HPV infection rate increased along with the pathological grade of the specimens, with a clear tendency of normal < CIN 1 < CIN 2 < CIN 3 < SCC. HPV16 infection was the predominate one and reached the highest level in SCC with 96%. HPV18 and 58 were detected only in some specimens as a second infection in addition to HPV16. The infection rate and type of HPV was not closely associated with the histological differentiation of the cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: HPV 16 was the most common type detected in Uighur women with SCC and CIN in the Xinjiang area of China. Together with the high infection rate, this may be the reason for the four-fold higher cervical cancer incidence in this province and in this population, when compared to total China. The prevalence of HPV18 and 58 was relatively low.",cancer
"Expression of p16 in serous ovarian neoplasms. PURPOSE: We aimed to examine p16 protein expression in ovarian serous neoplasms along with normal ovarian tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: P16 expression was immunhistochemically evaluated in 86 ovarian serous neoplasms (21 cystadenomas, 20 borderline tumors and 45 carcinomas) and 21 non-neoplastic ovarian tissue. The results were also compared with histopathological grade in serous adenocarcinomas. RESULTS: P16 expression rates for benign, borderline ovarian tumors and ovarian cancer were 14.2%, 85% and 86.6%, respectively. It was significantly higher in carcinomas (p < 0.001) and borderline tumors (p < 0.001) compared to cystadenomas. No immunoreactivity was found in the non-neoplastic ovarian surface epithelial cells. The percentage of p16 expression did not change significantly with histological grade in carcinomas. CONCLUSION: P16 expression is strong and widespread involving most tumor cells in serous papillary ovarian carcinomas, and is probably an early event.",cancer
"Bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin for advanced ovarian cancer: low risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular toxicity. The purpose of this preliminary study was to retrospectively assess the incidence of bowel perforation and hypertension in two separate advanced ovarian cancer patient populations following first-line therapy, comprising paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab. The first 20 patients were treated with six cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2), carboplatin (AUC of 5 i.v.), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg of body weight); q21 days per an independent protocol. The subsequent patients (n = 12) were administered weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2), carboplatin (AUC of 5 i.v.) every four weeks, and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg of body weight) every two weeks for six cycles according to a separate, independent protocol. Bevacizumab was not added to either chemotherapy regimen until cycle 2. In both groups patients who achieved a complete response, partial response or stable disease at the conclusion of induction therapy received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) q21 days as maintenance therapy. A total of 170 cycles (median = 6; range 3-6) of primary induction chemotherapy, 140 of which contained bevacizumab, were administered. Moreover, 206 cycles (median = 9; range 1-12) of maintenance chemotherapy have been delivered to 28 patients thus far. There was no incidence of GI perforation and only two patients demonstrated clinically significant hypertension. Previous studies involving bevacizumab have raised concerns regarding bowel perforations and hypertension. However, we did not encounter difficulties with either of these complications. While we recognize that the risk for bowel perforation remains in the 5-11% range, the study's preliminary results suggest that first-line treatment of advanced stage ovarian carcinoma with bevacizumab can be safely administered.",cancer
"Analysis of clinical and molecular associations of triple negative breast cancers in node-negative patients. INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic modalities in node-negative breast cancer patients remain a matter of controversy. Various prognostic factors have been proposed to help select those patients that would most likely benefit from adjuvant therapy. In view of this notion the triple negative phenotype (hormone receptors and HER2 negative tumors) has gained increasing attention. AIM: To evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics of triple negative (TN) tumors in node-negative invasive breast carcinomas. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the archival pathology tissues of 160 patients with node-negative invasive carcinomas, diagnosed and treated in two surgical departments in Greece from 1999 to 2006. Statistical analysis was used to examine the association between TN tumors and other clinicopathological factors. RESULTS: Triple negative breast cancers correlated with higher histologic grade, mitotic activation index and Ki-67 expression (p < 0.05). Moreover TN tumors were correlated with negative staining for bcl-2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In node-negative breast cancer patients, triple negativity is associated with aggressive biologic behavior. Further studies are required to better understand the clinical implications of these findings.",cancer
"Non-hormonal treatment of vasomotor symptoms in gynecological cancer patients. Gynaecological cancer patients generally suffer from an earlier and more severe menopausal syndrome than the general female population. Hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and there are non-hormonal treatments that are proven to be more effective than placebo in randomized controlled trials, e.g., some antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine. The main limits to the use of these drugs in controlling hot flashes are the off-label use for this purpose, the very short follow-up and the fact that data come from studies performed on breast cancer, not on gynecological cancer patients. Patients believe that drugs derived from plants could be effective in relieving hot flashes and that they are harmless. Evidence is contrary to this belief and estrogen-sensitive cancer patients should be warned of the potential, though very weak, estrogenic effect of phytoestrogens and other ""natural"" drugs, and that their efficacy is close to that of a placebo.",cancer
"Repeated chemosensitivity testing in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is a highly chemosensitive tumor, but most patients with advanced EOC initially responding to first-line chemotherapy will eventually relapse. Chemosensitivity testing may offer an opportunity for the optimal selection of chemotherapeutic agents for individual patients. In the present retrospective analysis we have examined the changes in chemosensitivity profiles during the course of the disease. Chemosensitivity was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test. Two or more samples at least 14 days apart were obtained from 34 patients with ovarian cancer. Chemoresistance increased significantly at the second measurement only for paclitaxel and carboplatin, the most frequently used cytotoxic drugs. No significant difference compared to baseline was observed at subsequent measurements for any other cytotoxic agent studied, although a non-significant trend for increased chemoresistance was observed. In conclusion, in the present cohort only paclitaxel and carboplatin chemosensitivity changed significantly, although to a limited extent, during the course of the disease. In contrast to a limited increase of paclitaxel and carboplatin chemoresistance, no significant changes were observed for other cytotoxic agents examined. The present data indicate that chemoresistance increases, to a modest extent, against the drug most frequently used, but remains relatively stable during the course of disease, especially for agents that are not used in the therapeutic regimen.",cancer
"Increase of Mcm3 and Mcm4 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinomas. PURPOSE: To examine the relevance of expression of two proteins essential for DNA replication initiation, Mcm3 and Mcm4, in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). METHODS: 53 cases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma, 35 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) grade 2-3, 11 CIN I and 26 normal controls were studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-Mcm3 and anti-Mcm4 antibodies. RESULTS: We found Mcm3 and Mcm4 protein expression had a tendency to be stronger from control to CSCC. Both Mcm3 and Mcm4 were significantly upregulated in squamous cervical carcinoma compared to the control, CIN grade 1 and grade 2-3 (p < 0.001), and Mcm3 expression was correlated with CSCC cell differentiation. However there were no independent prognosis correlations between Mcm3 and Mcm4 and clinicopathological parameters including age, stage, tumor size, invasive depth and lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Mcm3 and Mcm4 were highly expressed in CSCC, and these two proteins might be useful as biomolecular markers in clinical diagnosis.",cancer
Liquid based cytology improves the positive predictive value of glandular smears compared to conventional cytology. PURPOSE: To investigate whether the introduction of liquid-based cytology (LBC) in an urban setting decreases the diagnosis of glandular neoplasia (grade 6) and improves the positive predictive value (PPV) of cervical cytological screening. METHODS: A retrospective database review was conducted identifying women with cervical cytological abnormalities including glandular neoplasia (grade 6) before and after the introduction of LBC. RESULTS: Following the introduction of LBC the rate of glandular neoplasia (grade 6) referrals fell from 1.08% to 0.69% of all cervical cytological abnormalities. There was a significant reduction in 'abnormal' cytological samples subsequently found to be associated with no invasive or preinvasive disease but no decrease in the number showing preinvasive or invasive disease. A significant decrease in number of patients having a final diagnosis of normal/inflammatory or wart changes was seen in those patients referred during the LBC period (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The introduction of LBC in an urban setting decreased cytological glandular neoplasia referrals but not at the expense of missing preinvasive and invasive cancers. It has also increased the PPV of cervical sampling to detect preinvasive and invasive cancer from 59.6% to 76.0%.,cancer
"A comparison of outcome in patients with stage 1 clear cell and grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with and without adjuvant therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcomes in patients with Stage I uterine clear cell carcinoma (UCCC) treated with and without adjuvant therapy, and to compare the outcomes in these patients to that of matched controls, patients with Stage I, grade 3, endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (EC). METHODS: Patients with FIGO Stage I UCCC who underwent comprehensive surgical staging between January 1996 and January 2007 were identified. Cases (UCCC) were matched by age, stage, adjuvant therapy, and year of diagnosis to controls consisting of patients with grade 3 EC. Recurrence and survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 25 patients with Stage I UCCC were identified of whom 13 (52%) received no adjuvant therapy and 12 (48%) received adjuvant radiation therapy (XRT). The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates for the observation and the XRT groups were 78% and 75%, (p = 0.7) and 85% and 82% (p = 0.1), respectively. When compared to controls, the 5-year disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates of patients with Stage I UCCC were not significantly different, 77% vs 75% (p = 0.8) and 84% vs 88% (p = 0.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Stage I UCCC tumors there was no clear benefit to adjuvant radiation given the absence of improvement in recurrence risk or any survival benefit. These data question the benefit of radiation therapy in UCCC patients with disease confined to the uterus.",cancer
"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-type distribution in relation to oral contraceptive use in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, Durban, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To determine HPV-type distribution among women with cervical dysplasia in relation to oral contraceptive usage. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study of four groups of patients according to oral contraceptive usage: non-users, users of less than five years duration, users of between five years and ten years, and users of more than ten years duration. Swabs of the cervix were analysed for HPV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: A total of 124 women were recruited for the study. There were 75 patients who were HIV-infected (seroprevalence 61%). There were 102 patients who were HPV positive (82%), of which 79 patients had high-risk HPV DNA (78%). In terms of the four oral contraceptive groups, high-risk HPV DNA was detected in 70% (n = 21), 79% (n = 22), 90% (n = 21) and 71% (n = 15) of patient, respectively. The odds of having HPV DNA was six times higher for the combination of contraceptive users of less than five years duration/non-users (OR 5.9, 95% CI: 1.87-18.77). There was no change when adjustment was made for age (OR 6.1, 95% CI: 1.9-19.4). HPV DNA type 16 and/or 18 was present in a total of 21 patients (49%) (non-contraceptive users and users < 5 years duration) versus 15 patients (42%) (oral contraceptive users of more than 5 years duration) (p = 0.524). HPV type 16 was the commonest HPV type detected (20.2%) and HPV type 58 was the next commonest hihg-risk HPV type (16.1%). HPV types 58 and 33 were detected in a much greater percentage of our population and HPV 16 in a much smaller percentage of our population compared with a non-South African population. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate an interesting distribution of HPV types in a South African population.",cancer
"Molecular markers in epithelial ovarian cancer: their role in prognosis and therapy. Epithelial cancer of the ovary is the most lethal malignancy of all gynaecological cancers. Various clinical and pathological features of ovarian cancer are used as predictors of clinical outcome. The use of molecular markers in common clinical practice seems promising for the diagnosis and prognostication. The aim of this review article is to describe current theories regarding the pathogenesis and molecular evolution of epithelial ovarian cancer. With respect to the molecules involved, this article focuses on whether they are associated with poor prognosis or not. This evaluation is performed in light of the progress made and the potential usefulness in treatment decisions without overlooking existing controversies that should be further studied. It is tempting to anticipate the gradual integration of molecular profiling in clinical practice.",cancer
"Hormone therapy/adjuvant chemotherapy induced deleterious effects on the bone mass of breast cancer patients and the intervention of physiotherapy: a literature review. In recent years, breast cancer has witnessed some notable improvements regarding early diagnosis and new therapeutical strategies, mainly because of the utilization of new drugs and systemic treatment protocols, which have had a direct impact in the increase of these patients' global survival rate. At the same time, it is an ever-growing concern among oncology professionals to identify and minimize as much as possible the effects of long-term toxicity resulting from cancer therapies. Within this context, physiotherapy fits as a preventive and rehabilitating factor regarding functional and skeletal alterations, deriving not only from the direct action of breast cancer, but also from the treatment to which these patients are submitted. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to revise the scientific literature on possible adjuvant chemotherapy-induced secondary deleterious effects on the bone mass of patients diagnosed with breast cancer, and also to revise the literature on the intervention of physiotherapy in cases of secondary bone mass loss caused by adjuvant chemotherapy in patients suffering from breast cancer. METHODOLOGY: The research was carried out by consulting the following medical websites: Medicus Medline Index, Lilacs, Sciello, PubMed (National Library of Medicine), Google Academic and Capes (a Brazilian website for scientific information). The selection gathers articles written in different languages, English in special, published from January 1998 to October 2008. RESULTS: 24 studies explicitly mention chemotherapy-induced direct and/or indirect effects upon bone mass. Different authors refer to bone mass loss as one possible secondary deleterious effect resulting from adjuvant chemotherapy applied in breast cancer treatment. Nonetheless, no scientific articles were found on the subject of physiotherapy intervention aimed at patients in this specific condition. CONCLUSION: The results achieved in this revision study point out the possible chemotherapy-induced late deleterious effects on patients diagnosed with breast cancer, as well as the additional risks for the development of further osteoporotic conditions. Hormone therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy treatments may in fact augment and accelerate the loss of bone mass, be it directly, through the action of chemotherapeutical drugs, or indirectly, through the reduction of estrogenic levels and precocious menopause. The scarce material on the rehabilitation of bone mass loss deriving from adjuvant treatments reveals, as it seems, a strong need for new studies on the subject.",cancer
"Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy added to the treatment of ovarian cancer. A review of achieved results and complications. OBJECTIVE: The late revelation of ovarian cancer ensures it as the leading cause of death among gynecologic cancers. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy have been the cornerstone for a long time to treat this disease. More recently, the modality of intraperitoneal administration of chemotherapy under hyperthermic conditions (HIPEC) has been added. This review surveys the results of HIPEC added to CRS in ovarian cancer. METHODS: A multi-database search was conducted focusing on mortality, morbidity and overall and disease-free (DF) survival rates. RESULTS: 16 studies were identified reporting the results of CRS followed by HIPEC of 546 patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Postoperative mortality was reported for 14 out of 481 patients in total (2.9%). The major morbidity rate varied between 3.4 and 50.0%. In all but one study (533 patients), 185 events were reported (34.5%) and 21 re-interventions after 476 operations (4.4%). Survival data ranged from 10.0 to 57.1 months for the DF survival and from 19.0 to 76.1 months for the overall survival. Optimal cytoreduction and recurrent disease were associated with a better outcome in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Adding HIPEC to the current treatment modalities for ovarian cancer seems to be feasible. Improved survival rates have been reported at the cost of acceptable mortality rates. Nevertheless, there was a selection bias, the morbidity should not be underestimated and it is unclear yet which patient will benefit most from this treatment. Randomized controlled trials will provide an answer to this question.",cancer
"Could the eventual results of the NSABP* 39/RTOG** 0413 trial for partial breast irradiation (PBI) be improved by combining spherical applicators and whole breast irradiation? Radiobiology suggests it may. There may be unacceptable risks associated with the relatively large single doses of irradiation prescribed over five days instead of over six weeks for three of the four trial arms of the NSABP39/RTOG 0413 clinical trial seeking to enlist 4,300 patients. The first arm prescribes 60 Gray (Gy) in two Gy fractions over six weeks, which is the present standard. The dose implications of the other three arms with reference to this standard were examined using the ID2 formalism. Particularly poor (non-homogeneous) dose distributions characterise spherical applicators like ""MammoSite"" used as a sole device for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). The alternative treatment, APBI done by 3-D conformal radiation, may also have a drawback, namely a sudden sharp cut-off in dose which may cause cosmetic problems due to circumscribed fibrosis and edema. Some recently published results from this trial reveal an alarming level of complications. The possible causes of these complications and poor cosmetic outcomes and how to avoid them are examined. An obstacle to the more widespread use of the ""MammoSite type of device is that the device is not allowed closer than 5-7 mm from the skin or ribs; a possible remedy for this restriction is offered. It is also intended to make the relevant radiobiological principles usable for surgical oncologists.",cancer
"Therapeutic choices for curing dysodia?...three clinical cases. These three clinical cases provide an approach to the management of anatomical voice disorders. When confronted with a laryngeal diagnosis, talented musicians often suffer a crisis of self-confidence which may propel them toward maladaptive compensations; these may destabilize their usual techniques, already disrupted by the changes in their vocal acoustics. In their forties, each of these patients presents with an angiomatous lesion of the vocal fold, associated in two of the cases with a congenital structural weakness. For the three of them, the recommended therapeutic choice was alternating recorded laryngoscopic follow-up, alternative medicine prescriptions, and ""artistic sessions"" that required that their phoniatrician adapt to their repertory, their temperament, the constraints of the stage and their laryngeal disorder in order that they achieve a compromise between the needs of their career and the laryngeal anatomic realities of the moment. These ""artistic guidance sessions"" are recorded so as to allow the patient to become aware of the quality of their public performance and to learn the functional elements contributing to it.",cancer

"Phenotypic heterogeneity among tumorigenic melanoma cells from patients that is reversible and not hierarchically organized. We investigated whether melanoma is hierarchically organized into phenotypically distinct subpopulations of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells or whether most melanoma cells retain tumorigenic capacity, irrespective of their phenotype. We found 28% of single melanoma cells obtained directly from patients formed tumors in NOD/SCID IL2Rgamma(null) mice. All stage II, III, and IV melanomas obtained directly from patients had common tumorigenic cells. All tumorigenic cells appeared to have unlimited tumorigenic capacity on serial transplantation. We were unable to find any large subpopulation of melanoma cells that lacked tumorigenic potential. None of 22 heterogeneously expressed markers, including CD271 and ABCB5, enriched tumorigenic cells. Some melanomas metastasized in mice, irrespective of whether they arose from CD271(-) or CD271(+) cells. Many markers appeared to be reversibly expressed by tumorigenic melanoma cells.",cancer
"FoxOs enforce a progression checkpoint to constrain mTORC1-activated renal tumorigenesis. mTORC1 is a validated therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, analysis of Tsc1-deficient (mTORC1 hyperactivation) mice uncovered a FoxO-dependent negative feedback circuit constraining mTORC1-mediated renal tumorigenesis. We document robust FoxO activation in Tsc1-deficient benign polycystic kidneys and FoxO extinction on progression to murine renal tumors; murine renal tumor progression on genetic deletion of both Tsc1 and FoxOs; and downregulated FoxO expression in most human renal clear cell and papillary carcinomas, yet continued expression in less aggressive RCCs and benign renal tumor subtypes. Mechanistically, integrated analyses revealed that FoxO-mediated block operates via suppression of Myc through upregulation of the Myc antagonists, Mxi1-SRalpha and mir-145, establishing a FoxO-Mxi1-SRalpha/mir-145 axis as a major progression block in renal tumor development.",cancer
"B55beta-associated PP2A complex controls PDK1-directed myc signaling and modulates rapamycin sensitivity in colorectal cancer. The PP2A serine/threonine protein phosphatase serves as a critical cellular regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. However, how this pathway is altered in human cancer to confer growth advantage is largely unknown. Here, we show that PPP2R2B, encoding the B55beta regulatory subunit of the PP2A complex, is epigenetically inactivated by DNA hypermethylation in colorectal cancer. B55beta-associated PP2A interacts with PDK1 and modulates its activity toward Myc phosphorylation. On loss of PPP2R2B, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin triggers a compensatory Myc phosphorylation in PDK1-dependent, but PI3K and AKT-independent manner, resulting in resistance. Reexpression of PPP2R2B, genetic ablation of PDK1 or pharmacologic inhibition of PDK1 abrogates the rapamycin-induced Myc phosphorylation, leading to rapamycin sensitization. Thus, PP2A-B55beta antagonizes PDK1-Myc signaling and modulates rapamycin sensitivity.",cancer
"Hdac3 is essential for the maintenance of chromatin structure and genome stability. Hdac3 is essential for efficient DNA replication and DNA damage control. Deletion of Hdac3 impaired DNA repair and greatly reduced chromatin compaction and heterochromatin content. These defects corresponded to increases in histone H3K9,K14ac; H4K5ac; and H4K12ac in late S phase of the cell cycle, and histone deposition marks were retained in quiescent Hdac3-null cells. Liver-specific deletion of Hdac3 culminated in hepatocellular carcinoma. Whereas HDAC3 expression was downregulated in only a small number of human liver cancers, the mRNA levels of the HDAC3 cofactor NCOR1 were reduced in one-third of these cases. siRNA targeting of NCOR1 and SMRT (NCOR2) increased H4K5ac and caused DNA damage, indicating that the HDAC3/NCOR/SMRT axis is critical for maintaining chromatin structure and genomic stability.",cancer
"Recombinant human erythropoietin antagonizes trastuzumab treatment of breast cancer cells via Jak2-mediated Src activation and PTEN inactivation. We found that the receptor for erythropoietin (EpoR) is coexpressed with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) in a significant percentage of human breast tumor specimens and breast cancer cell lines. Exposure of HER2 and EpoR dual-positive breast cancer cells to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) activated cell signaling. Concurrent treatment of the cells with rHuEPO and trastuzumab reduced the cells' response to trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. We identified Jak2-mediated activation of Src and inactivation of PTEN as underlying mechanisms through which rHuEPO antagonizes trastuzumab-induced therapeutic effects. Furthermore, we found that compared with administration of trastuzumab alone, concurrent administration of rHuEPO and trastuzumab correlated with shorter progression-free and overall survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.",cancer
"Aberrant epigenetic landscape in cancer: how cellular identity goes awry. Appropriate patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications are required to assure cell identity, and their deregulation can contribute to human diseases, such as cancer. Our aim here is to provide an overview of how epigenetic factors, including genomic DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA regulation, contribute to normal development, paying special attention to their role in regulating tissue-specific genes. In addition, we summarize how these epigenetic patterns go awry during human cancer development. The possibility of ""resetting"" the abnormal cancer epigenome by applying pharmacological or genetic strategies is also discussed.",cancer
"Development of ipilimumab: contribution to a new paradigm for cancer immunotherapy. Identification of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) as a key negative regulator of T-cell activity led to development of the fully human, monoclonal antibody ipilimumab to block CTLA-4 and potentiate antitumor T-cell responses. Animal studies first provided insight into the ability of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody to cause tumor regression, particularly in combination regimens. Early clinical studies defined ipilimumab pharmacokinetics and possibilities for combinability. Phase II trials of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma showed objective responses, but a greater number of patients had disease stabilization. In a phase III trial, ipilimumab was the first agent to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival in patients with previously treated, advanced melanoma. The adverse event profile associated with ipilimumab was primarily immune-related. Adverse events can be severe and life-threatening, but most were reversible using treatment guidelines. Ipilimumab monotherapy exhibits conventional and new patterns of activity in advanced melanoma, with a delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The observation of some new response patterns with ipilimumab, which are not captured by standard response criteria, led to novel criteria for the evaluation of immunotherapy in solid tumors. Overall, lessons from the development of ipilimumab contributed to a new clinical paradigm for cancer immunotherapy evolved by the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.",cancer
"Signaling through OX40 enhances antitumor immunity. The existence of tumor-specific T cells, as well as their ability to be primed in cancer patients, confirms that the immune response can be deployed to combat cancer. However, there are obstacles that must be overcome to convert the ineffective immune response commonly found in the tumor environment to one that leads to sustained destruction of tumor. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily direct diverse immune functions. OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are key TNF members that augment T-cell expansion, cytokine production, and survival. OX40 signaling also controls regulatory T-cell differentiation and suppressive function. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated that OX40 agonists enhance antitumor immunity in preclinical models using immunogenic tumors; however, treatment of poorly immunogenic tumors has been less successful. Combining strategies that prime tumor-specific T cells together with OX40 signaling could generate and maintain a therapeutic antitumor immune response.",cancer
"Biology and clinical applications of CD40 in cancer treatment. CD40 is a costimulatory molecule widely expressed by immune cells and by neoplastic cells of different histotypes. Engagement of surface CD40 mediates different effects depending on cell type and microenvironment. In particular, CD40 expression on immune cells regulates humoral and cellular immunity, while it has apoptotic and antiproliferative activity on selected neoplastic cells. Thus, CD40 targeting may indirectly affect tumor growth through the activation of immune cells and/or directly by mediating cytotoxic effects on neoplastic cells. Preliminary findings emerging from clinical trials indicate that antibodies to CD40 can induce immune modulation and clinical responses in cancer patients.",cancer
"Clinical experiences with anti-CD137 and anti-PD1 therapeutic antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide a pharmacological platform to block or activate the function of surface receptors. The immune system has evolved receptor-ligand pairs that repress or empower the cellular immune response, which, if tampered with, unleash more potent cellular immunity against tumor antigens. Agonist antibodies directed against CD137 (4-1BB) on the surface of antigen-primed T lymphocytes increase tumor immunity that is curative against some transplantable murine tumors. A fully human IgG4 anti-CD137 antibody is under development with signs of clinical activity and cases of severe liver toxicity that seem to be on-target and dose-dependent effects. Programmed death-1 (PD1) is a surface molecule delivering inhibitory signals important to maintain T-cell functional silence against their cognate antigens. Interference with PD1 or its ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) increases antitumor immunity. As a result anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 human mAbs are under clinical development. Phase I trials with anti-PD1 mAb have yielded encouraging results with durable objective responses and a reasonable safety profile. As new class of drugs in cancer therapy, immunostimulatory mAbs have resulted in redefinition of tumor response criteria and rethinking of the rationale for combining these among each other and with other strategies.",cancer
"The emerging toxicity profiles of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies across clinical indications. The promising new class of immunomodulating antibodies directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) has been extensively tested in clinical trials and found to be active against cutaneous melanoma and other tumor histotypes. Inhibition of CTLA-4 characteristically induces well-identified side effects for which the definition ""immune-related adverse events"" (irAEs) has been proposed. IrAEs mainly include colitis/diarrhea, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies; uveitis, nephritis, and inflammatory myopathy also have been reported occasionally. These unique side effects are likely a direct result of breaking immune tolerance upon CTLA-4 blockade and are generally mild, reversible, and manageable, following specific treatment guidelines that include symptomatic therapies or systemic corticosteroids. However, patient-physician communication and early treatment are also emerging as critical issues to successfully manage irAEs, thus avoiding major complications. The major experience in identifying and managing CTLA-4 treatment-related side effects has derived from studies in melanoma patients; nevertheless, accumulating clinical experiences are clearly demonstrating that irAEs are class-specific events, and that they are fully overlapping in patients with tumors of different histotypes. This review provides an overview of current safety data on CTLA-4 antagonists and of available strategies to optimize their clinical use in cancer patients.",cancer
"Update on immunologic therapy with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in melanoma: identification of clinical and biological response patterns, immune-related adverse events, and their management. Immune-modifying monoclonal antibodies may induce or enhance the natural immune response against tumor cells. The complex interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes as an immune response is strongly affected by anti-CD152 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, CTLA-4)-antibodies. However, specific CTLA-4 antibodies can block the CTLA-4 receptor and thus induce an unrestrained T-cell activation. To this stage, treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with the CTLA-4 antibodies ipilimumab and tremelimumab has only been investigated within clinical trials. The results of a phase III trial in patients with advanced disease treated with ipilimumab alone or in combination with a peptide vaccination (gp100) recently presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the Ameircan Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) made groundbreaking news as ipilimumab was demonstrated to be the first drug in melanoma treatment to show a significant prolongation of survival time. Patients undergoing treatment with CTLA-4 antibodies may experience immune-related phenomena and adverse events (irAEs) that differ greatly from the well-known adverse events of cytotoxic drugs and which are due to the CTLA-4 antibodies' specific mode of action. This review gives a condensed overview on the mechanisms of action, an update on clinical data of the two CTLA-4 antibodies, ipilimumab and tremelimumab, and detailed recommendations for adverse event management strategies.",cancer
"Anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy: immune monitoring during clinical development of a novel immunotherapy. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4), also known as CD152, is a co-inhibitory molecule that functions to regulate T-cell activation. Antibodies that block the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2 can enhance immune responses, including antitumor immunity. Two CTLA-4-blocking antibodies are presently under clinical investigation: ipilimumab and tremelimumab. CTLA-4 blockade has shown promise in treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, with a recently completed randomized, double-blind phase III trial demonstrating a benefit in overall survival (OS) in the treated population. However, this approach appears to benefit only a subset of patients. Understanding the mechanism(s) of action of CTLA-4 blockade and identifying prognostic immunologic correlates of clinical endpoints to monitor are presently areas of intense investigation. Several immunologic endpoints have been proposed to correlate with clinical activity. This review will focus on the endpoints of immune monitoring described in studies to date and discuss future areas of additional work needed.",cancer
"Brain metastasis in melanoma: clinical activity of CTLA-4 antibody therapy. Melanoma metastasizes frequently to the brain, and brain metastases generally drive the prognosis of melanoma patients. Surgical and radiation therapy improve the outcome of selected melanoma patients with brain metastasis, while systemic treatment using cytotoxic agents still plays a limited role. Temozolomide and fotemustine are preferentially used in melanoma patients with brain metastases in the United States and in Europe, respectively, with modest clinical activity. However, the results obtained with either agent are still limited, and efforts are needed to improve the outcome of these patients who are generally excluded from clinical trials. Among therapeutic agents in development, antibodies that block the interaction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2 and thus enhance antitumor immune responses have shown clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, including durable control of brain metastases. This chapter reviews the current data and the rationale for ongoing and future trials of combination cytotoxic plus immunomodulatory therapy by US and Italian multicenter trial groups.",cancer
"Clinical studies with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in non-melanoma indications. Available medical treatments have limited impact on the survival of patients with advanced cancer; therefore, new therapeutic strategies able to generate more effective host's immune responses against neoplastic cells are being actively pursued. Among these, a recent approach involves targeting of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), a key immune checkpoint molecule, by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Ipilimumab and tremelimumab represent the prototypes of this new class of immunomodulating mAb and have been extensively tested in metastatic melanoma with highly promising results. The clinical activity observed in melanoma has served as a model to exploit the therapeutic potential of CTLA-4 blockade in a variety of human malignancies. Along this line, early-phase trials with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs have been completed or are ongoing in tumors of different histotype. Results are demonstrating the feasibility, safety, and activity of these agents, thus suggesting a promising therapeutic role to be further investigated in phase II/III trials in a wide range of tumors. This review summarizes the main trials with ipilimumab and tremelimumab in tumors of different histotypes, excluding cutaneous melanoma, which is extensively described in other chapters of this issue of Seminars in Oncology.",cancer
"Anti-CTLA-4 antibody adjuvant therapy in melanoma. Thus far the development of adjuvant therapies in melanoma has suffered greatly from the lack of effective drugs in stage IV melanoma. Chemotherapy, cytokines, vaccines, and combinations of drugs have been used with minimal success. This has led to adjuvant therapies that are not used uniformly or widely because of the rather marginal benefits, as no consistent and clinically significant impact on survival has been demonstrated. A new development for interferon-based adjuvant therapy seems to be the observation that better effects are observed in patients with lower tumor load and in patients with an ulcerated primary melanoma. A benefit for patients with more advanced lymphnodal involvement is quite unsure, clearly requiring new drugs to be explored. A new era in the treatment of melanoma treatment has arrived with the anti-cytoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies. The randomized trial in advanced metastatic melanoma demonstrated a clear benefit with prolongation of survival. The anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab has finally changed the landscape. It is therefore only logical that a worldwide adjuvant trial with ipilimumab versus placebo, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18071, is ongoing in patients with lymph node metastases, and that another adjuvant trial with ipilimumab compared to high-dose interferon (HDI) is planned in the United States. The EORTC 18071 trial will reach full accrual in 2011 and thus results are expected in 2013 or 2014.",cancer
"Clinical development of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab. Tremelimumab (formerly CP-675,206) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody tested in patients with cancer, of whom the majority have had metastatic melanoma. Clinical trials using tremelimumab demonstrate that this antibody can induce durable tumor regressions (up to 8 years at this time) in 7% to 10% of patients with metastatic melanoma. These tumor responses are mediated by the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as demonstrated in patient-derived tumor biopsies. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the range of 20% to 25% are mainly inflammatory or autoimmune in nature, which are on-target effects after inhibiting CTLA-4-mediated self-tolerance. The lack of survival advantage in the early analysis of a phase III clinical trial comparing tremelimumab with standard chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma highlights the importance of gaining a better understanding of how this antibody modulates the human immune system and how to better select patients for this mode of therapy.",cancer
"Ipilimumab: unleashing the power of the immune system through CTLA-4 blockade. Malignant melanoma is rising faster in incidence than any other malignancy. Long-term remission or ""cure"" is rare and is almost exclusively limited to therapies that stimulate an immune antitumor response. Ipilimumab is a novel targeted human immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen4 (CTLA-4), an immune-inhibitory site expressed on activated T cells. Ipilimumab is well tolerated as an outpatient infusion therapy. Multiple studies have confirmed significant antimelanoma activity. A randomized trial has documented a survival benefit when ipilimumab was compared to a gp-100 vaccine only arm. The unique mechanism of action of ipilimumab makes assessment of response by conventional criteria difficult. Benefit from ipilimumab can occur after what would be considered progression with World Health Oganization (WHO) or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. New immune response criteria have been proposed. Therapeutic responses peak between 12 and 24 weeks, with slow responses continuing up to and beyond 12 months. The major drug- related adverse side effects (10%-15% grade 3 or above) are immune-related and consist most commonly of rash, colitis, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and hepatitis. Colonic perforation can occur and patients with diarrhea have to be monitored carefully with strict adherence to treatment algorithms. Algorithms for the treatment of other adverse side effects have been developed. The treatment of immune-related side effects with immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids, does not appear to impair antitumor response. With proper monitoring and management of side effects, ipilimumab is an extremely safe drug to administer. The benefits of ipilimumab will most certainly extend to other malignancies in the near future.",cancer
"Predictive value of CD24 and CD44 for neoadjuvant chemotherapy response and prognosis in primary breast cancer patients. PURPOSE: We investigated the significance of CD24 and CD44 expression for predicting responses to chemotherapy and prognosis in primary breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnosis of breast cancer was confirmed by core needle biopsy, and immunohistochemical studies were performed. Preoperatively, patients received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Expression of CD44 and CD24 was assessed immunohistochemically and the relationship with chemotherapy response and with prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2004, 139 women were enrolled in this study. In the correlation analysis, CD24 expression was negatively associated with pathological response to chemotherapy (p = 0.0003). A machine learning technique with an alternating decision tree (ADTree) showed that four logical rules are involved in predicting the response depending on the combination of CD24, HER2, tumor stage, CD44, progesterone receptor, and patient age. In the survival analysis, patients having CD44 (++) showed a significantly favorable prognosis as compared with others (p = 0.0002). A multivariate analysis showed that CD44 expression had an independent prognostic value (p < .0001). CONCLUSION: We found a significant correlation between CD44 expression and prognosis and between CD24 expression and response to chemotherapy. CD24 and CD44 expressions would be useful predictive markers, although further studies are needed.",cancer
"HER-2/neu cytoplasmic staining is correlated with neuroendocrine differentiation in breast carcinoma. HER2 oncoprotein plays an essential role in breast cancer growth and differentiation. Determination of HER2 status contributes not only to predicting survival but also to selecting the patients for anti-HER2 therapy. HER2 protein expressed in human cancer cells often contains variant forms as well as the full-length wild-type form. In the present study, we investigated the subcellular localization of HER2 protein in 1053 primary breast cancer tissues. HER2 protein was stained by various immunohistochemical methods and studied by immunoelectron microscopy to confirm the intracellular localization. Thirty-four of 1053 specimens showed cytoplasmic staining of the intracellular domain of HER2 protein by the HercepTest and CB-11. In contrast, no immunoreactivity to the antibodies against the extracellular domain was observed. None of the 34 specimens showed amplification of the HER2 protein by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Subsequently, we studied the association of the cytoplasmic expression of HER2 with neuroendocrine differentiation. Interestingly, all 34 specimens had some positive signals of neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, and CD56. Although the result is preliminary, it warrants further study on the role of the cytoplasmic variant form of HER2 in breast cancer growth, particularly in the aspect of neuroendocrine differentiation.",cancer
"Irradiation-induced p53 expression is attenuated in cells with NQO1 C465T polymorphism. NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO) 1 polymorphism is associated with various hematological malignancies, especially infant leukemia or therapy-related leukemias, which involve the rearrangement of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) with either of 2 well known polymorphic variations of C609T and C465T were selected from our archives of EBV-LCL clones and studied the induction of p53 expression after DNA damage. Irradiation of cells with C609T/C609T polymorphism (NQO1 *2*2) did not affect the induction of p53 expression. However, irradiation of cells with C465T/WT polymorphism (NQO1 *1*3) resulted in attenuation of p53 and p21 induction. Our results suggest that increased risk of infant leukemia development in patients with NQO1 *1*3 polymorphism is partially dependent on the inhibition of p53 pathway, though further studies are needed to fully understand the pathological role of C465T variant in the development of childhood leukemia.",cancer
"McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS): early and extensive bone fibrous dysplasia involvement and ""mistaken identity"" oophorectomy. BACKGROUND: McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a triad of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (GIPP), cafe-au-lait spots (CALS) and fibrous dysplasia (FD) of bone. The extent of the abnormalities is variable. PATIENT AND RESULTS: We report a 3 year old girl with CALS since infancy, FD diagnosed at age of 2.5 years, and at the age of 3 years vaginal bleeding. The ultrasound revealed a cystic mass of the ovary, surgical pathology found ovarian cyst. LHRH stimulation demonstrated GIPP (LH 9.8 mIU/ml and FSH 8.9 mIU/ml; normal LH 1.8-10, FSH 9-26 mIU/ml). Radiographs and bone scans demonstrated FD in multiple bones. Peripheral leucocytes and the ovary were negative for GNAS gene mutations. Treatment with Letrasole interrupted the pubertal development. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the clinical signs of MAS are telling and that timely MAS diagnosis prevents unnecessary oophorectomy. A close follow up is recommended regarding development of endocrine disorders and spreading of FD.",cancer

"Use of pathway information in molecular epidemiology. Candidate gene studies are generally motivated by some form of pathway reasoning in the selection of genes to be studied, but seldom has the logic of the approach been carried through to the analysis. Marginal effects of polymorphisms in the selected genes, and occasionally pairwise gene-gene or gene-environment interactions,are often presented, but a unified approach to modelling the entire pathway has been lacking. In this review, a variety of approaches to this problem is considered, focusing on hypothesis-driven rather than purely exploratory methods. Empirical modelling strategies are based on hierarchical models that allow prior knowledge about the structure of the pathway and the various reactions to be included as 'prior covariates'. By contrast, mechanistic models aim to describe the reactions through a system of differential equations with rate parameters that can vary between individuals, based on their genotypes. Some ways of combining the two approaches are suggested and Bayesian model averaging methods for dealing with uncertainty about the true model form in either framework is discussed. Biomarker measurements can be incorporated into such analyses, and two-phase sampling designs stratified on some combination of disease, genes and exposures can be an efficient way of obtaining data that would be too expensive or difficult to obtain on a full candidate gene sample. The review concludes with some thoughts about potential uses of pathways in genome-wide association studies.",cancer
"Platelets: linking hemostasis and cancer. Platelets are the main cellular component in blood responsible for maintaining the integrity of the cardiovascular system via hemostasis. Platelet dysfunction contributes to a wide range of obvious pathological conditions, such as bleeding or thrombosis, but normal platelet function is also linked to diseases not immediately associated with hemostasis or thrombosis, such as cancer. Since the description of Trousseau syndrome in 1865, various experimental and clinical studies have detailed the interaction of platelets with primary tumors and circulating metastatic tumor cells. Observations have suggested that platelets not only augment the growth of primary tumors via angiogenesis but endow tumor cells physical and mechanical support to evade the immune system and extravasate to secondary organs, the basis of metastatic disease. Many laboratory and animal studies have identified specific targets for antiplatelet therapy that may be advantageous as adjuncts to existing cancer treatments. In this review, we summarize important platelet properties that influence tumorigenesis, including primary tumor growth and metastasis at the molecular level. The studies provide a link between the well-studied paradigms of platelet hemostasis and tumorigenesis.",cancer
"The contribution of Langerhans cells to cutaneous malignancy.

The skin is a highly responsive immunological organ that contains a unique population of immature intraepidermal dendritic cells (DCs) called Langerhans cells (LCs). Although LCs show morphological and migratory changes in response to epidermal perturbation, and can function as antigen-presenting cells to activate T cells, their role in carcinogenesis is unknown. Here we review recent studies that have provided clues to the potential roles that LCs might play in the pathogenesis of skin cancer, beyond their stimulation or regulation of adaptive immunity. Understanding this role of LCs might provide new perspectives on the relevance of DC populations that are resident within other epithelial tissues for cancer.",cancer
"Recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) aided radioiodine treatment for residual or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer. BACKGROUND: For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) following thyroidectomy, thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) for four to six weeks has been used for decades to increase serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in order to enhance iodine-131 uptake by normal thyroid cells and differentiated thyroid tumour cells. Exogenous stimulation with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) offers an alternative to THW while avoiding the morbidity of hypothyroidism. However, the efficacy of rhTSH-aided iodine-131 treatment for residual or metastatic DTC has not been prospectively assessed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of rhTSH-aided radioiodine treatment for normal residual or metastatic DTC. SEARCH STRATEGY: We obtained studies from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (all until November 2009), and paper collections of conferences held in Chinese. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled clinical trials and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing the effects of rhTSH with THW on iodine-131 treatment for residual or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer with at least six months of follow up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Altogether 223 patients with DTC participated in four trials. Overall, studies had a high risk of bias. We found no statistically significant differences between rhTSH and THW treatment in terms of successful ablation rate but significant benefits in radiation exposure to blood and bone marrow. One trial reported on benefits in some domains of health-related quality of life. There were no deaths and no serious adverse effects in DTC patients treated with either rhTSH or THW. Maximum follow up was 12 months. None of the included trials investigated complete or partial remission of metastatic tumour, secondary malignancies or economic outcomes. We did not find sufficient data comparing rhTSH with THW-aided radioiodine treatment for metastatic DTC. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results from four randomised controlled clinical trials suggest that rhTSH is as effective as THW on iodine-131 thyroid remnant ablation, with limited data on significant benefits in decreased whole body radiation exposure and health-related quality of life. It is still uncertain whether lower iodine-131 doses (1110 MBq or 1850 MBq versus 3700 MBq) are equally effective for remnant ablation under rhTSH stimulation. Randomised controlled clinical trials are needed to guide treatment selection for metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.",cancer
"Pharmacological treatments for fatigue associated with palliative care. BACKGROUND: In healthy individuals, fatigue is a protective response to physical or mental stress, often relieved by rest. By contrast, in palliative care patients fatigue can be severely debilitating, thereby impacting daily activity and quality of life, often with rest not counteracting fatigue. Fatigue frequently occurs in patients with advanced disease and modalities treating cancer often contribute or cause fatigue. Further complicating issues are its multidimensionality, subjective nature, and lack of a consensus definition of fatigue. Pathophysiology is not fully understood and evidence-based treatment approaches are needed. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine efficacy of pharmacological treatments on non-specific fatigue in palliative care. The focus was on patients at an advanced stage of disease, including cancer and other chronic diseases associated with fatigue, aiming to relieve fatigue. Studies aiming at curative treatment (e.g. surgical intervention for early breast cancer) were not included. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched EMBASE; Psych Lit, CENTRAL and MEDLINE to June 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning adult palliative care with focus on pharmacological treatment of fatigue. The primary outcome had to be non-specific fatigue (or related terms such as asthenia). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Results were screened and included if they met the selection criteria. If two or more studies were identified that investigated a specific drug in a population with the same disease, meta-analysis was conducted. In addition, comparison of type of drug investigated in a specific population as well as comparison of frequent adverse effects of fatigue treatment was done by creating overview tables. MAIN RESULTS: More than 2000 publications were screened, and 22 met inclusion criteria. In total, data from 11 drugs and 1632 participants were analysed. Studies investigating amantadine, pemoline, and modafinil in participants with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)-associated fatigue and methylphenidate in patients suffering from advanced cancer and fatigue could be used for meta-analysis. Amantadine in MS and methylphenidate in cancer patients showed a superior effect. Most studies had low participant numbers and were heterogenous. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific drug for treatment of fatigue in palliative care patients. Surprisingly, corticosteroids have not been a research focus for fatigue treatment, although these drugs are frequently used. Recent fatigue research seems to focus on modafinil, which may be beneficial although there is no evidence currently. Amantadine and methylphenidate should be further examined. Consensus regarding fatigue assessment in advanced disease is needed.",cancer
"Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: The lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of treatment options for clinically localised prostate cancer continues to impact on clinical decision-making. Two such options are radical prostatectomy (RP) and watchful waiting (WW). WW involves providing no initial treatment and monitoring the patient with the intention of providing palliative treatment if there is evidence of disease progression. OBJECTIVES: To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of RP versus WW for the treatment of localised prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, ISI Science Citation Index, DARE and LILACS were searched through 30 July 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of RP versus WW for clinically localised prostate cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out independently by two authors. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Both trials commenced prior to the widespread availability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; hence the results may not be applicable to men with PSA-detected disease.One trial (N = 142), conducted in the US, was judged to be of poor quality. All cause (overall) mortality was not significantly different between RP and WW groups after fifteen years of follow up (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.43).The second trial (N = 695), conducted in Scandinavia, was judged to be of good quality. After 12 years of follow up, the trial results were compatible with a beneficial effect of RP on the risks of overall mortality, prostate cancer mortality and distant metastases compared with WW but the precise magnitude of the effect is uncertain as indicated by the width of the confidence intervals for all estimates (risk difference (RD) -7.1% (95% CI -14.7 to 0.5); RD -5.4% (95% CI -11.1 to 0.2); RD -6.7% (95% CI -13.2 to -0.2), respectively). Compared to WW, RP increased the absolute risks of erectile dysfunction (RD 35% (95% CI 25 to 45)) and urinary leakage (RD 27% (95% CI 17 to 37)). These estimates must be interpreted cautiously as they are derived from data obtained from a self-administered questionnaire survey of a sample of the trial participants (N = 326), no baseline quality of life data were obtained and nerve-sparing surgery was not routinely performed on trial participants undergoing RP. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The existing trials provide insufficient evidence to allow confident statements to be made about the relative beneficial and harmful effects of RP and WW for patients with localised prostate cancer. The results of ongoing trials should help to inform treatment decisions for men with screen-detected localised prostate cancer.",cancer
"Screening programmes for the early detection and prevention of oral cancer. BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is an important global healthcare problem, its incidence is increasing and late-stage presentation is common. Screening programmes have been introduced for a number of major cancers and have proved effective in their early detection. Given the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with oral cancer, there is a need to determine the effectiveness of a screening programme for this disease, either as a targeted, opportunistic or population based measure. Evidence exists from modelled data that a visual oral examination of high-risk individuals may be a cost-effective screening strategy and the development and use of adjunctive aids and biomarkers is becoming increasingly common. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of current screening methods in decreasing oral cancer mortality. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 20 May 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 20 May 2010), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 20 May 2010) and CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 20 May 2010). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of screening for oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders using visual examination, toluidine blue, fluorescence imaging or brush biopsy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The original review identified 1389 citations and this update identified an additional 330 studies, highlighting 1719 studies for consideration. Only one study met the inclusion criteria and validity assessment, data extraction and statistics evaluation were undertaken by six independent review authors. MAIN RESULTS: One 9-year RCT has been included (n = 13 clusters: 191,873 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in the age-standardised oral cancer mortality rates for the screened group (16.4/100,000 person-years) and the control group (20.7/100,000 person-years). A 43% reduction in mortality was reported between the intervention cohort (29.9/100,000 person-years) and the control arm (45.4/100,000) for high-risk individuals who used tobacco or alcohol or both, which was statistically significant. However, this study had a number of methodological weaknesses and the associated risk of bias was high. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although there is evidence that a visual examination as part of a population based screening programme reduced the mortality rate of oral cancer in high-risk individuals, whilst producing a stage shift and improvement in survival rates across the population as a whole, the evidence is limited to one study and is associated with a high risk of bias. This was compounded by the fact that the effect of cluster randomisation was not accounted for in the analysis. Furthermore, no robust evidence was identified to support the use of other adjunctive technologies like toluidine blue, brush biopsy or fluorescence imaging within a primary care environment. Further randomised controlled trials are recommended to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a visual examination as part of a population based screening programme.",cancer
"Fraction size in radiation treatment for breast conservation in early breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Shortening the duration of radiation therapy would benefit women with early breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery. It may also improve access to radiation therapy by improving efficiency in radiation oncology departments globally. This can only happen if the shorter treatment is as effective and safe as conventional radiation therapy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 3, 2008. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of altered radiation fraction size on outcomes for women with early breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the WHO ICTRP search portal to June 2009, reference lists of articles and relevant conference proceedings. We applied no language constraints. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of unconventional versus conventional fractionation in women with early breast cancer who had undergone breast conserving surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors performed data extraction independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion. We sought missing data from trial authors. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials reported on 7095 women. The women were highly selected: tumours were node negative and 89.8% were smaller than 3 cm. Where the breast size was known, 87% had small or medium breasts. The studies were of low to medium quality. Unconventional fractionation (delivering radiation therapy in larger amounts each day but over fewer days than with conventional fractionation) did not affect: (1) local recurrence risk ratio (RR) 0.97 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.22, P = 0.78), (2) breast appearance RR 1.17 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.39, P = 0.09), (3) survival at five years RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.04, P = 0.16). Acute skin toxicity was decreased with unconventional fractionation: RR 0.21 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.64, P = 0.007). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Two new studies have been published since the last version of the review, altering our conclusions. We have evidence from four low to medium quality randomised trials that using unconventional fractionation regimens (greater than 2 Gy per fraction) does not affect local recurrence, is associated with decreased acute toxicity and does not seem to affect breast appearance or late toxicity for selected women treated with breast conserving therapy. These are mostly women with node negative tumours smaller than 3 cm and negative pathological margins. Long-term follow up (> 5 years) is available for a small proportion of the patients randomised. Longer follow up is required for a more complete assessment of the effect of altered fractionation.",cancer
"Addition of drug/s to a chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer. BACKGROUND: The addition of a chemotherapy drug or drugs to an established regimen is one method used to increase the dose and intensity of treatment for metastatic breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of adding one or more chemotherapy drugs to an established regimen in women with metastatic breast cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (to August 2009) using the codes for ""advanced breast cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"". This review is an update of the original Cochrane Review (Issue 3, 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials with a first line regimen of at least two chemotherapy drugs compared to the same regimen plus the addition of one or more chemotherapy drugs in women with metastatic breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data independently from published trials. We derived hazard ratios (HR) from time-to-event outcomes where possible, and used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. We analysed response rates as dichotomous variables and extracted toxicity data where available. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 trials reporting on 22 treatment comparisons (2674 patients randomised). Fifteen trials (20 treatment comparisons) reported results for tumour response and 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons) published time-to-event data for overall survival. There were 1532 deaths in 2116 women randomised to trials of the addition of a drug to the regimen and control (the regimen alone). There was no detectable difference in overall survival between these patients, with an overall HR of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.07, P = 0.47) and no significant heterogeneity. We found no difference in time to progression between these regimens, with an overall HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, P = 0.31) and no significant heterogeneity. Addition of a drug to the regimen was favourably associated with overall tumour response rates (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, P = 0.04) although we observed significant heterogeneity for this outcome across the trials. Where measured, acute toxicities such as alopecia, nausea and vomiting and leucopenia were more common with the addition of a drug. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The addition of one or more drugs to the regimen shows a statistically significant advantage for tumour response in women with metastatic breast cancer but the results suggest no difference in survival time or time to progression. The positive effect on tumour response was also associated with increased toxicity.",cancer
"Prophylactic mastectomy for the prevention of breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Recent progress in understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer has increased interest in prophylactic mastectomy (PM) as a method of preventing breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: (i) To determine whether prophylactic mastectomy reduces death rates from any cause in women who have never had breast cancer and in women who have a history of breast cancer in one breast, and (ii) to examine the effect of prophylactic mastectomy on other endpoints, including breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality, disease-free survival, physical morbidity, and psychosocial outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2002), MEDLINE and Cancerlit (1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (1974 to June 2006), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal (until June 2006). Studies in English were included. SELECTION CRITERIA: Participants included women at risk for breast cancer in at least one breast. Interventions included all types of mastectomy performed for the purpose of preventing breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors independently abstracted data. Data were summarized descriptively; quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity of study designs and insufficient reporting. Data were analyzed separately for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). MAIN RESULTS: All 39 included studies were observational studies with some methodological limitations; randomized trials were absent. The studies presented data on 7,384 women with a wide range of risk factors for breast cancer who underwent PM.BPM studies on the incidence of breast cancer and/or disease-specific mortality reported reductions after BPM particularly for those with BRCA1/2 mutations. For CPM, studies consistently reported reductions in incidence of contralateral breast cancer but were inconsistent about improvements in disease-specific survival. Only one study attempted to control for multiple differences between intervention groups and this study showed no overall survival advantage for CPM at 15 years. Another study showed significantly improved survival following CPM but after adjusting for bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy, the CPM effect on all-cause mortality was no longer significant.Sixteen studies assessed psychosocial measures; most reported high levels of satisfaction with the decision to have PM but more variable satisfaction with cosmetic results. Worry over breast cancer was significantly reduced after BPM when compared both to baseline worry levels and to the groups who opted for surveillance rather than BPM.Case series reporting on adverse events from PM with or without reconstruction reported rates of unanticipated re-operations from 4% in those without reconstruction to 49% in patients with reconstruction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen studies have been published since the last version of the review, without altering our conclusions. While published observational studies demonstrated that BPM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies (ideally randomized trials) are needed. BPM should be considered only among those at very high risk of disease. There is insufficient evidence that CPM improves survival and studies that control for multiple confounding variables are needed.",cancer
"HPV/cervical cancer vaccination: parental preferences on age, place and information needs. INTRODUCTION: A vaccine against cervical cancer is available in New Zealand through school and primary care for girls aged 12-18 years. Factors that might increase or hinder widespread uptake by the target population need to be identified. AIM: To describe parents' preferences on where their daughter(s) receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, at what age, and their information needs. METHODS: 3123 questionnaires were distributed to parents recruited from 14 schools in 2008, prior to the start of the school-based vaccination programme. Outcome measures were: preferred age and place of vaccination, and information needs of parents and their daughters. Tests for significance were performed to determine whether parental preferences differed by ethnic group (Maori, Pacific, New Zealand European and 'Other'). RESULTS: A 25% response rate was achieved (769/3123). Receipt of the HPV vaccine in a clinic setting was preferred by 40% of parents; 25% preferred vaccination at school. Fifty percent preferred vaccination to occur at age 13 or older; 28% thought ages 10, 11 or 12 appropriate. One in three parents wanted more information and 65% said they would seek information from their family doctor before deciding on the vaccine for their daughter(s). DISCUSSION: We suggest that a programme delivered jointly in primary care and school settings, that is appropriately resourced for follow-up and information-sharing, would increase vaccine coverage. The rationale for vaccination at age 12 needs to be made clear to parents and evidence-based information needs to be delivered appropriately to parents and girls.",cancer
"Paying ""particle"" attention to novel melanoma treatment strategies. Malignant melanoma remains the deadliest form of skin cancer because of its highly aggressive nature and the lack of effective treatments. Recent investigations into alternative treatment strategies have highlighted the exciting potential of nanoparticles to increase melanoma cell delivery and the efficacy of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pharmacological inhibitors. In this issue, Chen et al. report a new liposomal nanoparticle for c-Myc siRNA delivery, noting it to be highly effective in reducing c-Myc expression and inhibiting melanoma tumor growth in mouse models. This preclinical study underscores the importance of investigating nanoparticle treatment options for chemoresistant melanomas.",cancer
"Risk of colorectal cancer in men on long-term androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or orchiectomy is a common but controversial treatment for prostate cancer. Uncertainties remain about its use, particularly with increasing recognition of serious side effects. In animal studies, androgens protect against colonic carcinogenesis, suggesting that androgen deprivation may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: We identified 107 859 men in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1993 through 2002, with follow-up available through 2004. The primary outcome was development of colorectal cancer, determined from SEER files on second primary cancers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the influence of androgen deprivation on the outcome, adjusted for patient and prostate cancer characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Men who had orchiectomies had the highest unadjusted incidence rate of colorectal cancer (6.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3 to 7.5), followed by men who had GnRH agonist therapy (4.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 4.0 to 4.9), and men who had no androgen deprivation (3.7 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 3.5 to 3.9). After adjustment for patient and prostate cancer characteristics, there was a statistically significant dose-response effect (P(trend) = .010) with an increasing risk of colorectal cancer associated with increasing duration of androgen deprivation. Compared with the absence of these treatments, there was an increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with use of GnRH agonist therapy for 25 months or longer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.53) or with orchiectomy (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.66). CONCLUSION: Long-term androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Targeted intervention strategies to increase and maintain mammography utilization among African American women. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of a theory-based, culturally relevant intervention designed to increase mammography screening among African American women in 8 underserved counties in Alabama. METHODS: Using principles derived from the Stages of Change, Community Health Advisor, and Community Empowerment models, we developed strategies to increase mammography screening. Trained volunteers (N = 143) provided tailored messages to encourage adoption and maintenance of mammography screening. We collected baseline and follow-up data on 1513 women in the communities targeted for the intervention. Our goal was to decrease the number of women in stage 1 (never screened) while increasing the number of women in stage 2 (infrequently screened) and stage 3 (regularly screened). RESULTS: At baseline, 14% (n = 211) of the women were in stage 1, 16% (n = 247) were in stage 2, and 70% (n = 1055) were in stage 3. After the 2-year intervention, 4% (n = 61) of the women remained in stage 1, 20% (n = 306) were in stage 2, and 76% (n = 1146) were in stage 3. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored motivational messages and peer support can increase mammography screening rates for African American women.",cancer
Sequencing of DC-SIGN promoter indicates an association between promoter variation and risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in cantonese. BACKGROUND: The dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an important pathogen recognition receptor of the innate immune system. DC-SIGN promoter variants play important role in the susceptibility to various infectious diseases. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy that is common in southern China and whether DC-SIGN promoter variants have effects on susceptibility to NPC is still unknown. The aim of this study is to ascertain the potential involvement of DC-SIGN promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NPC susceptibility. METHODS: We conducted a case control study based on Cantonese population including 444 NPC patients and 464 controls matched on age and sex. The 1041 bp of DC-SIGN promoter region was directly sequenced for all samples. Sequence alignment and SNP search were inspected using DNAStar analysis programs and haplotype frequencies were estimated in Haploview V 4.0. The associations between the SNPs and the risk of NPC were analyzed using chi-square test and non-conditional logistic regression analysis with SPSS 13.0 software. RESULTS: A total of six variants were observed in the DC-SIGN promoter region and DC-SIGN -139 GG and -939 AA were significantly associated with NPC risk with adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) of 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-3.59; P = 0.006) and 2.52 (1.29-4.93; P = 0.007) respectively and subjects carrying the risk allele DC-SIGN -871 G had 1.47-fold (95% CI = 1.14-1.90) increased risks of developing NPC (P = 0.003). Haplotype analysis revealed that h1 'AAAG' was significantly associated with protection against NPC (OR = 0.69; P = 0.0002) and the association was still significant when using 1000 permutation test runs (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that DC-SIGN promoter variants appear to be involved in the susceptibility to NPC and the detailed mechanism of this effect need further studies.,cancer

"DNMT3A mutations in acute myeloid leukemia. BACKGROUND: The genetic alterations responsible for an adverse outcome in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. METHODS: Using massively parallel DNA sequencing, we identified a somatic mutation in DNMT3A, encoding a DNA methyltransferase, in the genome of cells from a patient with AML with a normal karyotype. We sequenced the exons of DNMT3A in 280 additional patients with de novo AML to define recurring mutations. RESULTS: A total of 62 of 281 patients (22.1%) had mutations in DNMT3A that were predicted to affect translation. We identified 18 different missense mutations, the most common of which was predicted to affect amino acid R882 (in 37 patients). We also identified six frameshift, six nonsense, and three splice-site mutations and a 1.5-Mbp deletion encompassing DNMT3A. These mutations were highly enriched in the group of patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile (56 of 166 patients, or 33.7%) but were absent in all 79 patients with a favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The median overall survival among patients with DNMT3A mutations was significantly shorter than that among patients without such mutations (12.3 months vs. 41.1 months, P<0.001). DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse outcomes among patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile or FLT3 mutations, regardless of age, and were independently associated with a poor outcome in Cox proportional-hazards analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in patients with de novo AML with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and are independently associated with a poor outcome.

"Treatment of tracheal and bronchial tumors and tracheal and bronchial stent placement. Tumors of and trauma to the trachea and bronchi can result in loss of integrity of the airway and death. Once treated primarily with thoracic surgery, these conditions are increasingly being managed with interventional pulmonary procedures outside the operating room but requiring the assistance of anesthetists. These interventional procedures require airway instrumentation, necessitating anesthesia care for ventilation and obtundation of airway reflexes. A thorough preoperative assessment and consultation with the pulmonologist or surgeon performing the procedure are essential for successful completion of the tumor and scar reduction and subsequent stent placement. In addition, anesthetists may care for patients undergoing nonpulmonary surgery who have an existing bronchial or tracheal stent or patients requiring correction of displaced stents. A discussion on the preferred methods for caring for patients in these situations is included.",cancer
"Gastrosplenic fistula: etiologies, diagnostic studies, and surgical management. A gastrosplenic fistula is a rare event. Reported causes include a spontaneous malignant fistula, chemotherapy for gastric or splenic malignancies, peptic ulcer disease, Crohn disease, and trauma. We report a case of a gastrosplenic fistula discovered on abdominal computed tomography with contrast, performed in a patient with a history suspicious for malignancy. In this case, no etiology was identified prior to the surgical repair of the lesion despite extensive workup. Due to continued gastrointestinal blood loss requiring multiple transfusions, the patient was taken to surgery for splenectomy and partial gastrectomy. It was at that time that the diagnosis of a large B-cell lymphoma was made. Postoperative chemotherapy was initiated and led to remission of the malignancy. Though most cases require definitive surgical repair, the treatment plans for gastrosplenic fistulas depend largely on the etiology of the lesion.",cancer
"Fat replacement of the distal pancreas in a case of advanced gastric cancer. Preoperative computed tomography in a 67-year-old man admitted with type 2 advanced gastric cancer involving the upper body of the stomach revealed marked atrophy of the left lobe of the liver and atrophy of the distal pancreas. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was planned; however, additional distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was also performed during the operation because of direct invasion of the pancreas by the gastric cancer. Histopathologic examination of the resected pancreas revealed the absence of lobules, acini, conduits, and pancreatic ducts, with only islets of Langerhans found scattered in the adipose tissue. The findings revealed that the gastric cancer had directly invaded the fat, replacing the distal pancreas. In patients with fat-replaced pancreas, preoperative evaluation of direct invasion of adjacent organs/tissues by gastric cancer is difficult.",cancer
"Preoperative imaging diagnosis of carotid body tumors. Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are relatively frequent lesions encountered at high altitudes, such in as the Andean Mountains. A correct preoperative diagnosis is essential for surgical planning and performance. For this reason, we have reviewed the evolution of our experience in the imaging diagnosis of these tumors. Between 1980 and June 2008, 160 CBTs were diagnosed. A total of 138 tumors were operated on, 4 are waiting for surgery, and 18 were not operated on because of age, medical conditions, or patient refusal. We have reviewed retrospectively the modalities of imaging diagnosis in our patients who underwent operation. Among the 138 tumors operated on, a correct preoperative diagnosis was done in 127 cases (92%). The preoperative diagnosis of the remaining 11 patients was unspecified benign tumor for 6 patients and neck lymph node for 5 patients. The imaging methods performed by different radiologists were conventional ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound, carotid conventional angiography (CA), axial tomography, magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance angiography, and computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Most patients had more than one image study. Review of radiologist reports revealed a correct diagnosis in all carotid CA, magnetic resonance studies, and CTA. Additionally, CTA appeared to be a valuable method to predict the Shamblin group. Clinical suspicion and current image techniques permit a correct diagnosis in practically all cases of CBT.",cancer
"Clinical and dermoscopic progression of subungual hematomas. Subungual pigmentation is a very common problem and can result from pigments derived from melanin, blood, or fungi. Subungual hematoma usually appears as a reddish to reddish-black pigment depending on the age of the bleed, and it can easily be misdiagnosed as melanoma. In this study, we tried to show the clinical and dermoscopic progression of subungual hematomas. Thirty-six patients with the history of first nail trauma within the last 7 days were included in the study. All the patients were evaluated three times with 3-week intervals. The distance from proximal nail fold to the hematoma was measured by a paper ruler. The area and the largest diameter of the hematoma were calculated by using the Molescore software. At the beginning, the most common dermoscopic finding was the homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by small globules (n = 32, 88.9%), large globules (n = 29, 80.6%), and streaks (n = 19, 52.8%). At week 3, the most common dermoscopic finding was the homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by large globules (n = 27, 75%), small globules (n = 19, 52.8%), and streaks (n = 11, 30.6%). At the sixth week, the most common dermoscopic finding was homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by large globules (n = 16, 44.4%), small globules (n = 7, 19.4%), and streaks (n = 2, 5.6%). The diameter and the area of the hematoma shrunk gradually between weeks 0, 3, and 6 (P < 0.001). Dermoscopy is a very useful tool in the evaluation and differential diagnosis of subungual hematomas. Determination that the pigmented plague grows out distally and shrinks gradually will support the diagnosis of subungual hematoma.",cancer
"The effectiveness of transverse coloplasty in patients with ultra-lower rectal cancer. Rectal cancer accounts for 40% of colon cancer, and postoperative defecatory function is considered to markedly affect the patients' quality of life. We performed transverse coloplasty in 33 patients with rectal cancer who had undergone an anal function preservation operation in which the anastomotic site was within 1 cm of the dentate line (ultra-low anterior resection) and evaluated its effectiveness in controlling the patients' defecatory function. The average daily defecation frequency 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively was 7.8, 5, and 3.6 times daily following straight colorectal reconstruction (the anastomotic site was more than 5 cm from the dentate line) and 7.5, 3.5, and 2.4 times daily following transverse coloplasty, respectively. Concerning postoperative complications, anastomotic leakage, soiling, and constipation were observed in 1, 1, and 1 cases, respectively. Transverse coloplasty can be performed in a short time, and it is considered a safe and useful method to manage defecatory",cancer
"Significance of PET/CT in determining actual TNM staging for patients with various lung cancers. We investigated the difference in TNM stage of lung cancer provided by PET/CT (combining positron emission tomography and computed tomography) as compared with TNM stage obtained with conventional imaging studies (CI) with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with iron contrast media. Sixty-seven cases of lung cancer were included in this study. Overall, the rate of correction of TNM staging was 70.1% after PET/CT. The correction rate for each factor was 32.8% in T, 37.3% in N, and 37.3% in M. High rates of correction were observed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with 75% (6/8 cases) obtained by PET/CT. When SCLCs were divided into limited disease (n = 6) involving 1 hemithorax, including mediastinal and contralateral hilar lymph nodes, and others (extensive disease, n = 2), the correction rate was as high as 80% for limited disease. In conclusion, PET/CT can provide actual TNM staging and recognition for oncologists in staging, which would not mislead to selection of inadequate subsequent treatment.",cancer
"Radical perineal prostatectomy: the first experience. OBJECTIVE: to present relatively uncommon surgical procedure for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) underwent perineal radical prostatectomy (PRP) from 2006 to 2010. The average age was 65 +/- 5.2 years. The average preoperative PSA was 7.8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml. Two patients had pT2b stage, while four had pT2c stage. Gleason score ranged from 4-7. RESULTS: All patients had negative surgical margins. Average operative time was 109 +/- 20 minutes and average blood loss was 525 +/- 180 ml. The urethral catheter was removed after 12 days in all patients except one, who required prolonged catheterization due to urinary fistula. All patients were continent after three months. Average postoperative PSA was 0.07 +/- 0.03 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: Perineal radical prostatectomy is valuable surgical procedure that provides good oncological results as well as urinary and sexual function.",cancer
"Single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for cancer using a ""QuadiPort access system"". BACKGROUND: Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is developing rapidly and different devices are already available. However there is limited data in the literature about single port laparoscopic colorectal surgery. AIMS: We report the first case of a single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for cancer using the device ""QuadiPort Access System. METHODS: A 66 year old female affected by adenocarcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction underwent a radical single incision laparoscopic anterior resection performed by an experienced laparoscopic team. RESULTS: The preoperative staging was T2NOM0. The total operative time was 135 min. Length of hospital stay was 6 days. The length of the specimen was 27 cm and 21 nodes were isolated. The pathological examination showed adenocarcinoma staged T3N2MX; G2. There was no postoperative morbidity and at the 6 month follow-up, the patient presented in well condition with no complications and free from cancer. CONCLUSION: Single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for locally advanced high rectal cancer seems to be feasible and the ""QuadiPort Access System seems to be a valid device. To evaluate outcomes and costeffectiveness of SILS versus the standard laparoscopic colorectal surgery multicenter prospective randomised trials are necessary and the ""QuadiPort Access System"" could prove to be the device of choice.",cancer
"From mininvasive to maxinvasive surgery in colorectal cancer: modem evolution of oncologic specialized units. In the last years a wide range of new technique offers the possibility to have R0 resection in colorectal cancer. We report our experience about Single Port Laparoscopic Surgery (SPL) for not advanced right colon cancer and about pelvectomy with cilindric Abdominal Perineal Resection (APR) for advanced rectal cancer. SPL offer mainly cosmetic advantages but also quicker recovery. No touch technique with adequate surgical margin and lymphectomy were respected. Operative time of SPL was 85-115 minutes, the incision was 5 cm long. There were no complications. Length of hospital stay was 4-6 days. With advanced pelvic cancer, pelvic exenteration with en-bloc resection is indicated. Then we propose a case of a 55 years old woman with a pelvic recurrence from a metastatic rectal cancer involving the right obturator fossa, the vaginal stump, the right ureter. Modern surgical technique give us the chance to offer the most appropriate oncologic surgical treatment.",cancer
"Radiation bowel disease and its clinical implication. Pre-operative radiotherapy may induce radiation colitis and tumour regression. Histological evaluation of radiation colitis needs to be reproducible to assess disease progression. The severity of radiation colitis can be assessed and graded according to its histological features. Increased severity of disease appears to be associated with a higher degree of cellular atypia and a lesser eosinophilic infiltrate. The severity of histological changes does not appear to be associated with post-operative complications. Tumour regression is an interesting phenomenon, the histological grading of which is of prognostic importance. Patients treated with long course radiotherapoy appear to have more incidences of postoperative complications. However, these are though to be related to the degree of tumour regression rather than to the type of radiotherapy.",cancer
"Predicting the risk and diminishing the consequences of anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer. INTRODUCTION: Anastomotic leakage is one of the most serious early complications of any intestinal anastomosis. The morbidity and mortality are high and patients may be at increased risk of cancer recurrence. In colorectal surgery the risks are particularly high following low anterior resection. Factors which increase and decrease the risks are discussed. METHODS: A review of the main published risk factors for anastomotic leakage after anterior resection for rectal cancer together with the authors personal experience is reported. A review of a recent large randomized trial of a defunctioning stoma versus no stoma is outlined. RESULTS: The main factor influencing anastomotic leakage is the height of the anastomosis above the anal verge with the lower the anastomosis the higher the risk. All anastomoses within 7 cm of the anal verge are at increased risk which includes all patients who have had a total mesorectal excision. Neoadjuvant therapy (in particular long course radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy) increases the risk. Male sex, older age, smoking, alcohol in excess, short course radiotherapy, obesity, general fitness, immunosuppression have been reported in some series as increasing the risk. A temporary diverting stoma decreases the consequences of leakage and reduces the need for emergency re-operation. Anastomotic leakage is associated with an increased postoperative death rate, reoperative rates, need for a permanent stoma and possibly an increase in local recurrence and decreased cancer specific and overall survival. CONCLUSION: Anastomotic leakage is a serious early complication following surgery for rectal cancer. The height of the anastomosis and neoadjuvant therapy are the main predictors of an increased risk. A diverting stoma diminishes the consequences of risk and reduces the need for emergency re-operation.",cancer
"Endoscopic treatment for early stage colorectal tumors: the comparison between EMR with small incision, simplified ESD, and ESD using the standard flush knife and the ball tipped flush knife. BACKGROUND: Early stage colorectal tumors can be removed by endoscopic mucosal resection but larger such tumors (20 mm) may require piecemeal resection. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) using newly developed endo-knives has enabled en-block resection of lesions regardless of size and shape. However ESD for colorectal tumor is technically difficult. Therefore, we performed EMR with small incision (EMR with SI) for more reliable EMR, ESD with snaring (simplified ESD) and ESD using the standard Flush knife and the novel ball tipped Flush knife (Flush knife BT) for easier and safer colorectal ESD. AIMS: The aims of our study were (1) to compare the treatment results of the following 3 methods (EMR with SI/si-mplified ESD/ESD) for early stage colorectal tumors, and (2) to assess the performance of Flush knife BT in colorectal ESD. METHODS: We treated 24/44/468 colorectal tumors and examined the clinicopathological features and treatment results such as tumor size, resected specimen size, procedure time, en-bloc resection rate, complication rate. We also treated 58 colorectal tumors (LST-NG:20, LST-G:36, other:2) using standard Flush knife and 80 colorectal tumors (LST-NG:32, LSTG:44, other:2) using Flush knife BT, and examined the clinicopathological features and treatment results mentioned above and also the procedure speed. RESULT: The median tumor size (mm) (EMR with SI/ simplified EMR/ESD) was 20/17/30 (EMR with SI vs. simplified ESD: p = n.s, simplified ESD vs. ESD: p < 0.0001). The median resected specimen size (mm) was 22.5/26/41 (EMR with SI vs. simplified ESD: p = 0.0018, simplified ESD vs. ESD: p < 0.0001). The procedure time (min.) was 19/27/60 (EMR with SI vs. simplified ESD: p = n.s, simplified ESD vs. ESD: p < 0.0001) The en-block resection rate (%) was 83.3/90.9 /98.9. The complication rate (post-operative bleeding rate/perforation p=n.s). In the treatment results of ESD for LSTs by knives, there was no difference between standard Flush knife and Flush knife BT for clinicopathological features and treatment results (procedure time, complication rate and en bloc R0 resection rate). However, procedure speed (cm2/min.) of LST-G was significantly faster in the Flush knife BT than in standard Flush knife. (standard Flush knife: 0.21 vs. Flush knife BT: 0.27, p = 0.034). CONCLUSION: EMR with small incision (EMR with SI) and ESD with snaring (simplified ESD) are good option to fill the gap between EMR and ESD in the colorectum, and also considered to become the nice training for the introduction of ESD. Flush knife BT appears to improve procedure speed compared with standard Flush knife, especially for LST-G in colo-rectal ESD.",cancer
"Laparascopic colon resection for cancer: evidence based results. About 90-92% of patients with carcinoma of the colon are treated surgically. For other surgeons, laparoscopic surgery for the treatment of malignancies remains controversial because of concerns about the adequacy of lymphadenectomy, the extent of resection, early findings of port-site metastasis and the lack of data on long-term results. In our experience, there are no differences between the laparoscopic and laparotomic techniques, and only advantages if the laparoscopic technique is use correctly. We essentially agree with the good results of many studies published in the last ten years, but we are extremely confident that it is necessary to have a good learning curve and a high-volume cases hospital to obtain good results through a laparoscopic approach. So laparoscopic colorectal surgery should be performed only by surgeons who have completed training in this approach and who perform the procedure often enough to maintain a good level of competence.",cancer
"The minimally invasive approach, laparoscopic and robotic, in rectal resection for cancer. A single center experience. BACKGROUND: Robotic approach for rectal cancer competes with laparoscopy in centers dedicated to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) due to the technologic advantage. This is a report of our experience with MIS for rectal cancer. METHODS: A series of 84 consecutive patients with laparoscopic resection (between 1995-2010) and 38 consecutive patients with robotic resection (between 2008-2010) for primary rectal cancer were analyzed. Hartmann's procedures were excluded. Clinical and pathologic outcomes were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: In the laparoscopic group (LG), 50 anterior rectal resections (ARR), 34 abdominal perineal resections (APR) were performed while in the robotic group(RG) there were 30 ARR and 8 APR. The median operative time was 182 min (140-220 min) in LG and 208 min (180-300 min) in RG (p = 0.0002). No statistically significant difference was noticed between the groups in terms of conversion, morbidity, anastomotic leak and postoperative stay rates. Margin clearance was obtained in all patients and the median number of removed lymph nodes was similar: 11.37 in RG vs. 11.07 in the LG (p = 0.65) with a higher rate of metastatic lymph node involvement in laparoscopy (p = 0.0l012). Blood loss was higher in LG (150 ml vs. 100 ml; p = 0.0001). There were 5 (5.9%) local recurrences in the LG at a median follow-up of 27.5 months and 2 (5.2%) in the RG at a median follow-up of 13 months (p = 0.43). CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive surgery for rectal cancer proved to be safe and efficient with similar results in the two groups. Technological advances of robotic approach compared to laparoscopy allowed better ergonomics, more refined dissection, easier preserving of hypogastric nerves and less blood loss. Long term outcomes are to be assessed in prospective randomized studies.",cancer

"Quality assurance through outcome registration in colorectal cancer: an ECCO initiative for Europe. In recent years there have been significant improvements in outcome of rectal cancer treatment. Both new surgical techniques as well as effective neoadjuvant treatment regimens have contributed to these improvements. It is key to spread these advances towards every rectal cancer patient and to make sure that not only patients who are treated within the framework of clinical trials may benefit from these advancements. Throughout Europe there have been interesting quality programs that have proved to facilitate the spread of up to date knowledge and skills among medical professionals resulting in improved treatment outcome. Nevertheless, between European countries remain differences in outcome and treatment schedules that cannot be easily explained. The European CanCer Organisation (ECCO) has recognised these importances's and created the 'European Registration of Cancer Care' (EURECCA) framework to develop a European colorectal audit structure. EURECCA will advance future treatment improvements and spread these to all European cancer patients. It provides opportunities to treat elderly and comorbid patients evidence based while it offers an unique insight in social-economical healthcare matters. As such, ECCO has established the basis for a strong, multidisciplinary audit structure with the commitment to improve cancer care for every European cancer patient.",cancer
"Evidence and research perspectives for surgeons in the European Rectal Cancer Consensus Conference (EURECA-CC2). PURPOSE: Although surgery remains the most important treatment of rectal cancer, the management of this disease has evolved to become more multidisciplinary to offer the best clinical outcome. The International Conference on Multidisciplinary Rectal Cancer Treatment: Looking for an European Consensus' (EURECA-CC2) had the duty to identify the degree of consensus that could be achieved across a wide range of topics relating to the management of rectal cancer helping shape future programs, investigational protocols and guidelines for staging and treatment throughout Europe. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consensus was achieved using the Delphi method. Eight chapters were identified: epidemiology, diagnostics, pathology, surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, treatment toxicity and quality of life, follow-up, and research questions. Each chapter was subdivided by topic, and a series of statements were developed. Each committee member commented and voted, sentence by sentence three times. Sentences which did not reach agreement after voting round #2 were openly debated during the Conference in Perugia (Italy) December 2008. The Executive Committee scored percentage consensus based on three categories: ""large consensus"", ""moderate consensus"", ""minimum consensus"". RESULTS: The total number of the voted sentences was 207. Of the 207, 86% achieved large consensus, 13% achieved moderate consensus, and only 3 (1%) resulted in minimum consensus. No statement was disagreed by more than 50% of members. All chapters were voted on by at least 75% of the members, and the majority was voted on by 85%. CONCLUSIONS: This Consensus Conference represents an expertise opinion process that may help shape future programs, investigational protocols, and guidelines for staging and treatment of rectal cancer throughout Europe. In spite of substantial progress, many research challenges remain.",cancer
"Cancer health disparities persist among African Americans in Wisconsin. BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence and mortality rates have decreased over the last few decades, yet not all groups have benefited equally from these successes. This has resulted in increased disparities in cancer burden among various population groups. OBJECTIVE: This study examined trends in absolute and relative disparities in overall cancer incidence and mortality rates between African American and white residents of Wisconsin during the period 1995-2006. METHODS: Cancer incidence data were obtained from the Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System. Mortality data were accessed from the National Center for Health Statistics' public use mortality file. Trends in incidence and mortality rates during 1995-2006 for African Americans and whites were calculated and changes in relative disparity were measured using rate ratios. RESULTS: With few exceptions, African American incidence and mortality rates were higher than white rates in every year of the period 1995-2006. Although cancer mortality and incidence declined for both groups over the period, relative racial disparities in rates persisted over the period and account for about a third of African American cancer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Elimination of cancer health disparities will require further research into the many contributing factors, as well as into effective interventions to address them. In Wisconsin, policymakers, health administrators, and health care professsionals need to balance resources carefully and set appropriate priorities to target racial inequities in cancer burden.",cancer
"Self- and registry-reported cancer in a population-based longitudinal study. PURPOSE: To evaluate the concordance of cancer diagnosis from self- and registry reports. METHODS: Self-reported diagnosis information from participants in a cohort study was compared with linkage data from the Wisconsin Cancer Reporting System. RESULTS: Overall, there was good agreement between self- and registry-reported cancers, with 90% of all matches being considered an exact match. Concordance varied by cancer site; agreement was excellent for breast (85.4%) and prostate (78.9%) cancers. CONCLUSIONS: While self-reported cancer diagnoses for some cancers such as breast and prostate cancer are important sources of information and may be reliable substitutes when registry data are incomplete or not available, a combination of self and registry reports with mortality information may yield the most accurate information about cancer for purposes of health care planning and conducting epidemiologic studies.",cancer
"Improving the accuracy of pre-operative survival prediction in renal cell carcinoma with C-reactive protein. BACKGROUND: Validated objective biomarkers are needed for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) to guide patient management and define high-risk populations for follow-up or for therapeutic purposes. METHODS: Patients undergoing nephrectomy for RCC (n=286 all stages, 84% with conventional clear cell type) were included with a median duration follow-up of 5 years. The prognostic significance of pre-operative haematological and biochemical variables, including C-reactive protein (CRP) values were examined and whether they added additional information to a recently published pre-operative scoring system was determined. RESULTS: C-reactive protein was the most significant predictor of overall survival (OS; chi(2)=50.9, P<0.001). Five-year OS for patients with CRP </= 15 mg l(-1) vs >15 mg l(-1) was 72% (95% CI 65-78%) and 33% (95% CI 23-44%), respectively. Similar results were seen for cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival. On multivariate analysis, CRP remained highly significant for CSS (chi(2)=17.3, P<0.0001) and OS (chi(2)=9.8, P<0.002), in addition to other pre-operative variables including log of neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, red blood cell count and white cell count. C-reactive protein was significant in addition to the pre-operative nomogram score (chi(2)=12.5, P=0.0004 for OS, chi(2)=16.2, P=0.0001 for CSS and chi(2)=8.6, P=0.003 for DFS) and was still significant when other pre-operative variables were included. CONCLUSION: C-reactive protein and other haematological and biochemical variables have independent prognostic significance in RCC and may enhance pre-operative scoring systems.",cancer
"Population-based survival estimates for childhood cancer in Australia during the period 1997-2006. BACKGROUND: This study provides the latest available relative survival data for Australian childhood cancer patients. METHODS: Data from the population-based Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry were used to describe relative survival outcomes using the period method for 11,903 children diagnosed with cancer between 1983 and 2006 and prevalent at any time between 1997 and 2006. RESULTS: The overall relative survival was 90.4% after 1 year, 79.5% after 5 years and 74.7% after 20 years. Where information onstage at diagnosis was available (lymphomas, neuroblastoma, renal tumours and rhabdomyosarcomas), survival was significantly poorer for more-advanced stage. Survival was lower among infants compared with other children for those diagnosed with leukaemia, tumours of the central nervous system and renal tumours but higher for neuroblastoma. Recent improvements in overall childhood cancer survival over time are mainly because of improvements among leukaemia patients. CONCLUSION: The high and improving survival prognosis for children diagnosed with cancer in Australia is consistent with various international estimates. However, a 5-year survival estimate of 79% still means that many children who are diagnosed with cancer will die within 5 years, whereas others have long-term health morbidities and complications associated with their treatments. It is hoped that continued developments in treatment protocols will result in further improvements in survival.",cancer
"Bcl-2 and beta1-integrin predict survival in a tissue microarray of small cell lung cancer. INTRODUCTION: Survival in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is limited by the development of chemoresistance. Factors associated with chemoresistance in vitro have been difficult to validate in vivo. Both Bcl-2 and beta(1)-integrin have been identified as in vitro chemoresistance factors in SCLC but their importance in patients remains uncertain. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) are useful to validate biomarkers but no large TMA exists for SCLC. We designed an SCLC TMA to study potential biomarkers of prognosis and then used it to clarify the role of both Bcl-2 and beta(1)-integrin in SCLC. METHODS: A TMA was constructed consisting of 184 cases of SCLC and stained for expression of Bcl-2 and beta(1)-integrin. The slides were scored and the role of the proteins in survival was determined using Cox regression analysis. A meta-analysis of the role of Bcl-2 expression in SCLC prognosis was performed based on published results. RESULTS: Both proteins were expressed at high levels in the SCLC cases. For Bcl-2 (n=140), the hazard ratio for death if the staining was weak in intensity was 0.55 (0.33-0.94, P=0.03) and for beta(1)-integrin (n=151) was 0.60 (0.39-0.92, P=0.02). The meta-analysis showed an overall hazard ratio for low expression of Bcl-2 of 0.91(0.74-1.09). CONCLUSIONS: Both Bcl-2 and beta(1)-integrin are independent prognostic factors in SCLC in this cohort although further validation is required to confirm their importance. A TMA of SCLC cases is feasible but challenging and an important tool for biomarker validation.",cancer
"TRAIL-expressing mesenchymal stem cells kill the putative cancer stem cell population. BACKGROUND: Tumours contain stem-like, side population (SP) cells, which have increased tumorigenic potential, resistance to traditional therapies and may be responsible for treatment failures and relapse in patients. METHODS: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were engineered to express the apoptotic ligand, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Squamous (H357) and lung (A549) cancer cell lines were sorted into side and non-side populations (non-SP) by Hoechst flow cytometry. The survival and growth of both SP and non-SP cancer populations, in conjunction with TRAIL-expressing MSCs and mitoxantrone chemotherapy, were assessed by flow cytometry and colony forming ability. RESULTS: Mesenchymal stem cells expressing TRAIL migrate to tumours and reduce the growth of primary cancers and metastases. This report demonstrates that these cells cause apoptosis, death and reduced colony formation of the SP of squamous and adenocarcinoma lung cancer cells and are synergistic when combined with traditional chemotherapy in apoptosis induction. CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of putative cancer stem cells to TRAIL-expressing MSCs, suggests their possible role in the prevention of cancer relapse.",cancer
"Disabled-2 downregulation promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. BACKGROUND: Metastatic tumour cells are characterised by acquisition of migratory and invasive properties; properties shared by cells, which have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Disabled-2 (Dab2) is a putative tumour suppressor whose expression has been shown to be downregulated in various cancer types including breast cancer; however, its exact function in suppressing tumour initiation or progression is unclear. METHODS: Disabled-2 isoform expression was determined by RT-PCR analysis in human normal and breast tumour samples. Using shRNA-mediated technology, Dab2 was stably downregulated in two cell model systems representing nontumourigenic human mammary epithelial cells. These cells were characterised for expression of EMT markers by RT-PCR and western blot analysis. RESULTS: Decreased expression of the p96 and p67 isoforms of Dab2 is observed in human breast tumour samples in comparison to normal human breast tissue. Decreased Dab2 expression in normal mammary epithelial cells leads to the appearance of a constitutive EMT phenotype. Disabled-2 downregulation leads to increased Ras/MAPK signalling, which facilitates the establishment of an autocrine transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signalling loop, concomitant with increased expression of the TGFbeta2 isoform. CONCLUSION: Loss of Dab2 expression, commonly observed in breast cancer, may facilitate TGFbeta-stimulated EMT, and therefore increase the propensity for metastasis.",cancer
"Racial/Ethnic disparities and geographic differences in lung cancer incidence --- 38 States and the District of Columbia, 1998-2006. Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both males and females and the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Lung cancer affects some races more than others; blacks have higher incidence and mortality rates than do whites. This report presents the first analysis of lung cancer incidence among racial/ethnic groups by U.S. census region. CDC analyzed data collected by CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program for the period 1998-2006. These combined data reflect new lung cancer cases representing approximately 80% of the U.S. population. During this study period, annual incidence per 100,000 population was highest among blacks (76.1), followed by whites (69.7), American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) (48.4), and Asian/Pacific Islanders (A/PIs) (38.4). Hispanics had lower lung cancer incidence (37.3) than non-Hispanics (71.9). Incidence varied greatly with age, peaking among persons aged 70-79 years (426.7). The region with the highest incidence was the South (76.0); the lowest was the West (58.8). Among whites, the highest lung cancer incidence was in the South (76.3); the highest incidence among blacks (88.9), AI/ANs (64.2), and Hispanics (40.6) were in the Midwest, and the highest incidence among A/PIs was in the West (42.5). These findings identify the racial/ethnic populations and geographic regions that would most benefit from enhanced efforts in primary prevention, specifically by reducing tobacco use and exposure to environmental carcinogens.",cancer
"The crossover of bisphosphonates to cancer therapy. Bisphosphonates form a class of drugs commonly used to treat disorders of osteoclastic bone resorption, including osteoporosis, Paget's disease of the bone, rheumatoid arthritis, and bone metastases. Although long established as the therapy of choice to treat such disorders, bisphosphonates' potential in treating cancer is garnering interest. Bisphosphonates have been demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, induce apoptosis in tumor cells, and encourage immune reactions against tumor cells. Current applications of bisphosphonates in cancer treatment include their use to treat skeletal metastases and as an adjuvant to endocrine therapy. This review explores bisphosphonates' current clinical utility and potential as a crossover cancer therapy.",cancer
"Monitoring of human papillomavirus vaccination. Persistent infection with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary causal factor in the development of cervical cancer. Moreover, HPV, predominately type 16 and to a lesser degree type 18, is linked causally to varying proportions of other anogenital cancers (vulva, vagina, penis, anus) as well as cancers elsewhere in the body (oropharynx, larynx, conjunctiva). HPV types 6 and 11 cause most of genital warts and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Effective prophylactic vaccines have been developed. In this review, we address briefly the immunological aspects of HPV infection and the results of HPV vaccination trials. Internationally standardized monitoring and evaluation of prophylactic HPV vaccination programmes will be essential for arriving at the most cost-effective strategies for cancer control.",cancer

"Monosomy 12 and deletion of 13q34 in a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia with concomitant lung cancer. BACKGROUND: We described a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and lung cancer and unusual chromosomal aberrations. CASE REPORT: At the same time with the diagnosis of B-cell CLL, squamocellular lung carcinoma diagnosis was established. Using interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization technique (FISH) we detected monosomy 12 and deletion of 13q34 occurred in the same clone. One month after the beginning of examination the patient died unexpectedly during sleep immediately before we applied a specific treatment for CLL or lung carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous occurrence of monosomy 12 and deletion of 13q34 in a patient with B-cell CLL has been described only once before, but as a part of a complex karyotype. The prognostic significance of these abnormalities remains uncertain.",cancer
"Hematopathologic and cytogenetic findings in imatinib mesylate treated chronic myelogenous leukemia patients: 2.5 years' experience. BACKGROUND/AIM: Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with specific activity against the breakpoint cluster region--Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) tyrosine kinase has been developed for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Its hematologic and cytogenetic effects have been evaluated in a series of clinical trials. The aim of this study was to report hematologic and cytogenetic response in CML patients during the treatment with imatinib mesylate. METHODS: A total of 21 patients were treated and observed from July 2006 to December 2008. The median time from CML diagnosis was no more than 12 months, so all the patients received previous treatment with hydroxyurea for which the median time was 3 months. The patients received imatinib mesylate in an effective oral dose of 400 to 800 mg daily, which was followed with peripheral blood counts, bone marrow examination, and cytogenetic studies at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. RESULTS: Complete hematologic responses were reported for 19 (90.48%) of 21 patients studied. Among 19 patients who had a response, 16 (86%) did so within 3 months. The best cytogenetic response rate at any time during the study treatment with imatinib mesylate, among 14 patients in which cytogenetic response evaluated was: complete cytogenetic response in 7 (50%) patients, partial cytogenetic response in 6 (42.9%) patients and minor cytogenetic response in 1 (7.1%) patient. No patients had progressed to accelerated or blastic phase. The most frequent adverse effects that seemed to be related to treatment with imatinib mesylate were edema and musculoskeletal pain; overall, most were mild. Only one patient discontinued treatment because of hematologic toxic effects. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this study confirm that imatinib mesylate induces a complete hematological and cytogenetic response in a high percentage of patients with chronic-phase CML.",cancer
"The clinical significance of HPV screening in premalignant cervical lesions. PURPOSE: We evaluated the clinical significance of human papilloma virus (HPV) screening in premalignant cervical lesions. METHODS: This prospective study was performed at Dicle University, School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, from January 2009 to June 2009. A total of 60 cases were evaluated. Thirty cases had premalignant cervical lesions. The prevalence of HPV was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and types determined by Hybrid Capture II. The cases that had premalignant cervical lesions were evaluated with colposcopy. Statistical analyses were carried out by using the statistical packages for SPSS version 12.0 for Windows (Chicago, IL, USA). RESULTS: Of all the cases, those with premalignant cervical lesions had higher prevalence of HPV DNA. The cases that had high oncogenic HPV type had more abnormal colposcopic findings. CONCLUSION: Premalignant cervical lesions should be evaluated by cervical cytology, colposcopy, HPV DNA screening and cervical tissue sampling. In this way, development of cervical cancer can be prevented.",cancer
"Bone metastasis arising from a polyp of the cervix as the first symptom in generalized multi-organ adenocarcinoma. Our patient was a 40-year-old female with a positive familial history for malignancies but no chronic diseases. After two vaginal deliveries without any reported difficulties, the patient had no intermenstrual bleeding, postcoital bleeding, leucorrhea or hypermenorrhea, abnormal vaginal bleeding, or postmenstrual bleeding, except during the past five-year period when a polyp-like change in the cervix was found. There was no indication for polypectomy, considering the fact that the patient had no symptoms, had an iodine positive Schiller test, as well as regular cytological smears on Papanicolaou testing. It is noteworthy that the patient had no symptoms until changes in the stool and painful sensation in the hip area. The patient was subjected to extensive surgery by a team composed of a gynecologist, surgeon and orthopedist. During Werthaim-Meigs surgery, four positive glandules and cervical adenocarcinoma Stage II were found. The colon was removed, as a right hemicolectomy, as well as the iliac bone upper segment. Unfortunately, considering the changes in the tissue of the colon and cervix, we considered the condition to be ""generalized"" adenocarcinoma.",cancer
"Late recurrence of malignant melanoma mimicking ovarian malignancy. BACKGROUND: Malignant melanoma (MM) is an extremely malignant tumor with an unpredictable profile of spread and variable periods of remission. CASE: We describe an unusual case of malignant melanoma metastatic to the omentum occurring seven years after diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous malignant melanoma in the patient's arm. She received surgery and chemoimmunotherapy. To date, nine months after detection of malignant melanoma metastatic to the omentum, the patient is alive with no clinical and radiological metastatic disease. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of omentum malignant melanoma in a living patient is uncommon, thus very few individuals and referral centers can build up an adequate experience of handling this disease. Optimal management has been a challenge and a subject of debate and has not yet been established.",cancer
"Exaggerated placental site mimicking placental site trophoblastic tumor: case report and literature review. Exaggerated placental site is defined as a non-neoplastic trophoblastic lesion featuring exuberant infiltration into the endometrium and myometrium by intermediate trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblasts. Exaggerated placental site can occur following normal or ectopic pregnancy, abortion, or hydatidiform mole. We encountered a case of reactive exaggerated placental site seven months following normal pregnancy that clinically mimicked placental site trophoblastic tumor. Few reports have described the clinical course, histopathology and differential diagnosis of exaggerated placental site; we present our patient's case together with histopathological observations and review of related literature.",cancer
"Endometroid adenocarcinoma of the uterus, borderline tumor of the ovary and Brenner tumor of the contralateral ovary in a 63-year-old woman. Synchronous primary cancers of the endometrium and ovary occur in approximately 10% of all women with ovarian cancer and 5% of all women with endometrial cancer. The pathogenesis of synchronous endometrial and ovarian cancer is unclear. Synchronous tumors tend to be low grade and early stage. The prognosis is much better with survival approaching ten years than if the disease was classified as a single organ disease with metastasis. We report a case of unusual co-existence of endometroid adenocarcinoma of the uterus, serous borderline tumor of the ovary and Brenner tumor of the contralateral ovary in a 63-year-old woman. The patient recieved a surgical treatment and postoperative irradiation.",cancer
Use of surgical sealant in debulking surgery for advanced ovarian carcinoma--case report. Haemostatic sealants are frequently used in gynaecological surgery.

This is the first reported case with the successful use of Floseal in gynaecological oncology.,cancer
Hysteroscopic diagnosis of a high-grade endometrial sarcoma in a 41-year-old woman. Endometrial stromal sarcomas originate in the endometrial cavity. These tumors represent between 15-27.9% of uterine sarcomas. We present the case of a 41-year-old woman who underwent surgical hysteroscopy for metrorrhagia over a period of one month who had an intrauterine polypoid mass detected by ultrasonography. Histologic analysis of the polypoid mass removed by hysteroscopy was a high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma of the uterus. The description of this case provides an opportunity to review the literature on uterine sarcomas diagnosed by surgical hysteroscopy.,cancer
"Granulosa cell tumor and endometrial cancer: a case report and review of the literature. Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) of the ovary are an uncommon type of ovarian cancer, representing only 2-5%. Frequently, their tumoral cells present some features of normal granulosa cells, like hormonal production. As a consequence, this neoplasia can be diagnosed either by common ovarian cancer symptoms or endometrial pathologies due to an estrogenic effect. Symptoms caused by estrogen production can also give rise to different clinical manifestations depending on whether they appear in postmenopausal or young women. In the case we present below, a patient was referred for presenting postmenopausal bleeding of one year's duration. Once endometrial cancer was diagnosed and subsequently staged, an ovarian mass was detected. We report an atypical case of ovarian cancer with the aim of reviewing the clinical features of GCT, as well as its prognosis, treatment and follow-up recommendations, according to the available literature.",cancer
"Villoglandular papillary adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix diagnosed during pregnancy. Villoglandular papillary adenocarcinoma (VPA) is a very rare subtype of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix but a well recognized variant of cervical adenocarcinoma with a favorable prognosis generally occurring in women of child-bearing age. Only five cases of VPA and pregnancy have been reported. Herein, we report a case of VPA diagnosed during pregnancy and this patient delivered a healthy baby. A successful pregnancy can be completed in patients with VPA without lymph-vascular invasion, when treated conservatively. This management is particularly desirable in young women to preserve reproductive capability.",cancer
"Placental site trophoblastic tumor presenting as a friable cervical mass. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT) is a rare variant of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) and primarily composed of intermediate trophoblasts. In contrast to other forms of GTN, PSTT presents with only mildly elevated levels of beta-hCG and immunohistochemical staining of tissue samples is a helpful tool for diagnosis. CASE AND RESULTS: A 38-year-old gravida 3, parity 3 female presented to the emergency department after three weeks of abnormal vaginal bleeding. The uterus was mildly enlarged, midline, and mobile with minimal discomfort. A necrotic, friable mass was protruding through the cervical os and biopsies were obtained. The serum beta-hCG was 13 mIU/ml. Computed tomography revealed a mass within the endometrial cavity and cervix but no significant lymphatic adenopathy or metastasis. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, E-cadherin, human placental lactogen (hPL), and alpha inhibin. Surgery was considered curative. CONCLUSION: PSTT presenting as a friable cervical mass is uncommon. Biopsies of this mass lead to the correct diagnosis. Several immunohistochemical stains are suggested in the literature to evaluate for PSTT. Clinically, it is prudent for physicians to differentiate PSTT from other forms of GTN because of the poor response of PSTT to chemotherapy.",cancer
"Normal-sized ovarian papillary serous carcinoma: a case report. A normal-sized ovarian papillary serous carcinoma is rare. We present the case of a 46-year-old woman with progressive abdominal fullness of one week's duration. The medical evaluation revealed abdominal carcinomatosis with normal-sized ovaries and an elevated serum CA-125 level of 147,365.8 U/ml. Cytoreductive surgery (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, lymphadenectomy, infracolic omentectomy, peritoneal biopsy, washing cytology, and appendectomy) was performed. The histologic examination revealed an ovarian serous papillary carcinoma. Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered. The serum CA-125 level decreased after completion of treatment. Normal-sized ovarian serous surface papillary carcinomas should be kept in mind as an origin of disease in patients who have peritoneal carcinomatosis, which sometimes is a diagnostic dilemma of the disease source. We report this case to emphasize the clinical symptoms and importance of the early and accurate diagnosis of a normal-sized ovarian papillary serous carcinoma.",cancer
"Systemic chemotherapy--before or after radical surgery in treatment of patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma? PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: The aim of the study was to analyze whether application of systemic chemotherapy prior to radical surgery in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma influences the length of the progression-free period and overall survival rate. METHODS: This study analyzes two groups of patients in the period 2006-2009. The first group received systemic chemotherapy prior to radical surgery. The second group first had radical surgery after which systemic chemotherapy was administered. The therapeutic response to systemic chemotherapy was analyzed as well as progression-free survival and overall survival which was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log rank test. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed that patients who were administered systemic chemotherapy prior to radical surgery have significantly better progression-free survival as well as overall survival. Progression-free survival in patients who were first treated with systemic chemotherapy after which radical surgery followed was equal to 28 months and was significantly longer (p = 0.001) than progression-free survival in patients who were first subjected to radical surgery; it equaled 13 months, while the overall survival equaled 43 and 36 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Application of systemic chemotherapy prior to radical surgery has a significant influence on the length of the progression-free period and on the length of overall survival of patients affected by advanced ovarian cancer.",cancer
"Evaluation of LOOP electrosurgical excisional procedure: case series. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the loop electrosurgical excisional procedure (LEEP) which is performed to treat high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one cases diagnosed as LGSIL and HGSIL after histopathological examination were included in the study among patients who had cervical colposcopy-directed biopsies after an abnormal cytology report at Ege University School of Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology Department between the years of 2007 and 2009. The patients underwent LEEP or LEEP-cone procedures. RESULTS: The patients with cervical smear results of ten ASCUS, eight LGSIL, and three HGSIL underwent colposcopy-guided punch biopsies. Those with the result of CIN 1 and CIN 2 underwent LEEP or LEEP-cone procedures. Pathologic examination correlated with biopsy results and surgical margins were all negative. All patients were followed-up with cervical cytology. CONCLUSION: LEEP and LEEP-cone procedures are therapeutic procedures in cervical intraepithelial lesions.",cancer
"Comparative findings of oncogenic cervical risk and its follow-up in two different periods 1982-1999 and 2000-2007. During the 2000-2007 period, my group and I reviewed the cases of 3,036 patients undergoing routine colposcopies, cytology and cervical biopsies for those cases that merited it, and a 20% increase was found in lesions defined as dysplasias as compared with those found in the studies of the previous century. This is something that reaffirms the association with HPV by 96.5% versus 80% the last century. In relation to HPV infection, we found that the ""pure"" form was not only reached but rather surpassed by the findings associated with cancer and dysplasia in the years 2005-2006, a behavior considered irregular as compared to the usual. The majority of the patients were guided toward conservative local treatments, among which cryosurgery and cauterization prevailed as choices, and their evolution resulted in an 81% cure (considered as destruction of the lesion and negativity of the cytology and eventual biopsy). It can be concluded that the high vulnerability of the virus, in spite of its great aggressiveness as an oncogenic risk (OR) to a cervical-uterine lesion, can be supported by the high degree of lesions diagnosed by OR.",cancer

"Adjuvant chemotherapy versus radiation therapy after radical surgery in high-risk positive node stage IB/IIA cervical cancer. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy will improve the outcomes of high-risk patients with Stage IB, IIA squamous cervical carcinoma with positive pelvic and/or aortic nodes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 127 patients with Stage IB and IIA cervical carcinoma treated with radical hysterectomy and systematic pelvic/aortic lymphadenectomy (RS) and who had lymph node involvement, confirmed at the final histological examination were enrolled from January 1987 to December 2001. All the patients received three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) with cisplatin, bleomycin and vinblastine. The median patient age was 47.3. Seventy-seven patients had FIGO Stage IB1, 26 IB2 and 24 IIA. The results were compared with those obtained from a group of 136 patients with comparable age, stage and lymph node involvement, on whom radical surgery, systematic pelvic/aortic lymphadenectomy (RS) and adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was performed on period 1971-1984. The followup period ranged from 7-13 years. RESULTS: Overall survival rate of the two groups (RS+AC) vs (RS+RT) at seven years was 69.3% and 59.5%, respectively (chi2 = 2.70; p = .10). Progression-free survival was 59.8% vs 50.0% (chi2 = 2.56; p = .10 ns). The best results were however obtained with the common iliac and over two lymph node metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy in high-risk patients for lymph node positivity did not produce statistically significant results in terms of overall and disease-free survival vs adjuvant radiotherapy; however, a group of these patients, approximately 10%, could receive benefit from the treatment.",cancer
"TP53 gene polymorphisms and breast cancer in Croatian women: a pilot study. A case-control retrospective association study was conducted to investigate a possible association of the TP53 polymorphisms, Arg72Pro and PIN3 (+16bp), with sporadic breast cancer in Croatian women. Ninety-five women with breast cancer and 108 age-matched healthy women were analyzed. Arg72Pro polymorphism was detected by TaqMan essay. For designation of PIN3 (+16bp) polymorphism DNA amplification was performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) while the PCR products were detected by capillary electrophoresis. Homozygous genotype of minor allele of the PIN3 (+16bp) polymorphism was associated with sporadic breast cancer (OR = 2.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.80-2.56, p = 0.006). For Arg72 polymorphism, the odds ratio for breast cancer of ArgPro versus reference genotype ArgArg was 0.55 (95% CI 0.30-1.02, p = 0.039) suggesting the protective effect. Although different haplotypes did not influence the susceptibility to the disease, the joint occurrence of genotype combination ProPro/A2A2 frequent in cases, was associated with sporadic breast cancer (OR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.89-2.56, p = 0.021). The study provides evidence of the association of the TP53 gene polymorphisms Arg72Pro and PIN3 (+16bp) with sporadic breast cancer in the Croatian population.",cancer
The relationship between bcl-2 oncogene expression and clinicopathological criteria in various stages of cervical neoplasia in Egyptian women. PURPOSE: To assess the degree of bcl-2 expression in the various stages of cervical neoplasia in a sample population of Egyptian women and relate the findings to clinicopathological criteria of invasive cervical cancer. METHODS: Bcl-2 protein expression was assessed by immuno-histochemistry in 40 patients with cervical neoplasia (intraepithelial and invasive) in comparison to 20 patients with benign changes. Patients with invasive disease were followed up 2 years later and the outcome was correlated to the bcl-2 status at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Bcl-2 expression increased from 20% in normal cervical tissue to 42.9% in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II then dropped to 33% in invasive disease. Bcl-2 was not expressed (0%) in patients with advanced disease stage and grade nor in patients with lympho-vascular space invasion. CONCLUSION: Bcl-2 expression is reduced along the spectrum from benign towards invasive disease of the cervix. The maximum expression found in CIN II may suggest increased potential of progression to CIN III.,cancer
"Immunohistochemical evaluation and lymph node metastasis in surgically staged endometrial carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the expression of immunohistochemical markers in surgically staged endometrial cancer patients. METHODS: We studied 107 cases of primary untreated endometrial carcinoma in which the p53, bcl-2, her-2/neu, Ki-67, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) antigens were investigated by an immunohistochemical method. In the last 50 consecutive patients immunoreactivity for MMP-7 and MMP-26 was assessed as well. We evaluated the correlations among the immunohistochemical staining assessed by histoscore, and the age, grading, depth of invasion, stage of the neoplasia and extrauterine disease. RESULTS: Mean age was 65 years (range 34-88). All patients were submitted to total abdominal or modified radical vaginal hysterectomy plus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy; p53, bcl-2, her-2/neu, Ki-67, MMP-7, MMP-26, estrogen and progesterone receptors were positive in 36 (43%), 71 (86%), 13 (16%), 80 (96%), 65 (78%), 80 (96%), 61 (73%) and 71 (86%) patients, respectively. p53 overexpression was found to be related to poor grade of differentiation and deep myometrial invasion. Immunostaining for ER was inversely related to the histopathological differentiation of the tumors. Decreased expression of PR was related to advanced stage, poor histopathologic differentiation and extrauterine spread of disease. CONCLUSION: The overexpression of p53 seems to indicate more malignant phenotype, while PR expression correlates with parameters of better clinical outcome.",cancer
"Expression of cytokines in cervical stroma in patients with high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia after treatment with intralesional interferon alpha-2b. Conservative treatment with interferons (IFNs) has the advantage of preserving reproductive capacity in patients with grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The objective of this work was to study patients with high-grade CIN treated with intralesional IFN alpha-2b and to analyze the expression of Th1, Th2 and Th3 cytokines in cervical stroma. We observed that patients with a satisfactory response (60%) to treatment with IFN alpha-2b expressed more Th1 (IFN-gamma TNF-alpha, IL-2) cytokines, with a significant reduction in the viral load of high-risk human papillomavirus (p = 0.0313). All patients with therapeutic failure were smokers and had higher expression of cytokines Th2 (IL-4) or Th3 (TGF-beta2 and TGF-beta3).",cancer
"Initial analysis of relationship between plasma platinum concentration and hematological adverse reaction associated with weekly chemotherapy using nedaplatin in combination with radiotherapy for cervical carcinoma. PURPOSE: Established therapeutic guidelines for cervical carcinoma recommend concurrent chemo- and radiotherapy as standard treatment for locally advanced cervical carcinoma. Nedaplatin (CDGP) is a platinum agent developed in Japan that is less nephrotoxic than cisplatin (CDDP), but with equivalent antitumor potency. In the standard dosage regimen for cervical carcinoma, CDGP is administered once every four weeks (monthly regimen). We investigated the efficacy and safety of a new dosage regimen, in which CDGP was administered once weekly for five weeks (weekly regimen). METHODS: We measured plasma platinum concentration of patients after administration of CDGP, and analyzed the relationship between plasma platinum concentration and hematological adverse reactions such as thrombocytopenia and leucopenia. RESULTS: The relative rates of change in platelet and white blood cell counts tended to increase as the plasma concentration of platinum increased. Furthermore, the rate of change in platelet counts in relation to the area under the curve was greater for the monthly regimen as compared to weekly. On the other hand, the relative rates of change in WBC were nearly the same between the regimens. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that when using chemotherapy with CDGP for a patient with a cervical carcinoma, a weekly regimen might reduce the severity of thrombocytopenia, while still exhibiting the same therapeutic efficacy as the monthly regimen.",cancer
"The association of preoperative thrombocytosis with prognostic factors in malign ovarian tumor. PURPOSE: We assessed the association of preoperative thrombocytosis with prognostic factors in malign ovarian tumor. METHODS: Over a five-year period, cases treated for ovarian cancer were randomly assigned. The data were collected from gynecological oncology, radiation oncology, medical oncology and pathology departments. Statistical analyses were carried out by using the statistical packages for SPSS 12.0 for Windows (Chicago, IL, USA). Survival was analyzed by the method of Kaplan and Meier, using log-rank (Mantel-Cox) analysis. RESULTS: 51 cases with ovarian cancer were evaluated. Cases with thrombocytosis were found to have greater CA-125 levels, more advanced stage disease, more ascites and shorter periods of survival. CONCLUSION: Thrombocytosis is a poor prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. As reported previously, it is associated with aggressive tumor biology. Thus, preoperative thrombocytosis can be a used as a marker of poor outcomes.",cancer
"Isolated groin recurrence in vulval squamous cell cancer (VSCC). The importance of node count. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a node count which can define an adequate inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy (IFL) in primary VSCC. METHODS: A retrospective and prospective review of patients with node negative VSCC who had a full staging IFL. Detection of isolated groin recurrences (IGR) would allow groins with higher risk of groin recurrence to be identified. RESULTS: The median node count of 228 IFLs in 139 patients was eight (0-24). There were six IGR (4.3%). Increased rate of IGR was present in patients with increased age, tumour diameter and depth of invasion, lymphovascular space invasion, unilateral IFL, and moderate/poor tumour grade. In the 138 groins with node counts of eight or greater there were no IGRs compared to six in the patients with either undissected groins or groin node counts less than eight (p = 0.030) Interval to IGR was significantly shorter than other sites of recurrence. Both disease-specific and overall survival were significantly reduced in IGR. CONCLUSIONS: An inadequate IFL is a nodal count of less than eight per groin; both these groins and undissected groins are at increased risk of IGR and should have close surveillance.",cancer
"Late toxicities in concurrent chemoradiotherapy using high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy plus weekly cisplatin for locally advanced cervical cancer: a historical cohort comparison against two previous different treatment schemes. PURPOSE: To determine the long-term toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), using high-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDRICB) compared to radiation (RT) alone in patients with advanced cervical cancer using a control-cohort study. METHODS: A total of 332 cases of Stage IIB-III disease were included in this comparative study. Seventy-three patients were treated with a 3-insertion schedule and labeled group A, whereas the other 146 patients with a 4-insertion schedule became group B. One hundred and thirteen patients treated by a 4-insertion protocol with concurrent weekly cisplatin were labeled group C. RESULTS: The cumulative rate of grade 2 or above rectal complication was 13.7% for group A, 9.6% for the group B and 15.9% for group C (p = 0.76), whereas the grade 3 to 4 non-rectal radiation-induced intestinal injury was 6.8% for group A, 6.2% for group B and 9.7% for group C (p = 0.20). Grade 2 to 4 late bladder toxicity was higher in group C, with the cumulative rate being 5.5% for group A, 4.8% for group B and 15.0% for group C (p = 0.004). The independent factor for a rectal complication was the occurrence of a bladder complication (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 3.06). The independent factors for bladder complications were the use of CCRT (p = 0.01, hazard ratio 2.08), and the occurrence of rectal complications (p = 0.02, hazard ratio 2.77). CONCLUSIONS: When treating advanced cervical cancer, HDRICB consisting of four 6 Gy insertions and weekly cisplatin shows a trend of increasing late bladder complications. The interval between drug administration and HDRICB should be kept long enough to avoid any synergistic effect of both regimens.",cancer
"Follow-up in a long-term randomized trial with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for squamous cell cervical carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to achieve radical surgery in a larger number of patients with locally advanced/or bulky Stage IB cervical carcinoma. We conducted a trial to determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy would improve disease-free survival and overall survival in Stage IB-III cervical cancer. DESIGN: Prospective randomized clinical study with long-term follow-up. SETTING: Department of Gynecology, Perinatology and Child Health, II Faculty University of Rome ""La Sapienza"". METHODS: 288 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix, FIGO Stage IB-IIIB were randomized to one of the following treatments: three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin, vincristine, bleomycin (NACT arm; n = 159); conventional surgery or exclusive radiotherapy (CONV arm; n = 129). There was no difference in age, FIGO stage, tumor size and lymph node involvement between the two groups (p = ns). Two hundred and thirty-four patients in Stage IB-IIb (n = 129 NACT arm and n = 105 CONV arm) and 24 patients in Stage III (NACT arm) who proved to be chemosensitive underwent radical hysterectomy. Six Stage III patients, non responders to chemotherapy, and 24 patients, Stage III of the CONV arm, underwent radiotherapy. Follow-up extended for seven years. RESULTS: The study was performed on disease-free survival related to several prognostic factors: age, FIGO stage, tumor size, grading, parametrial involvement, lymph node status and surgical margins. Recurrence of disease occurred in 49 (32.1%) patients of the NACT arm (n = 153) and in 39 (37.1%). patients of the CONV arm (n = 105). Statistically significant differences in the recurrence of the disease were related to FIGO stage (p < 003), grading (p < .05), parametrial involvement (p < .002) lymph node status (p < .0001) and tumor size (p <.002). No statistical significance was related to age and surgical margins (p = ns). Disease-free and overall survival in the two groups were, respectively, 65.4% vs 53.5% (p = ns) and 70.4% 65.9% (p = ns).",cancer
"Concomitant expression of HER2 and HIF-1alpha is a predictor of poor prognosis in uterine cervical carcinoma treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy: prospective analysis (KGROG0501). BACKGROUND: In previously reported retrospective analyses of uterine cervical carcinoma cases, HER2 was correlated with poor radiation sensitivity and poor treatment outcomes and HIF-1alpha was found to be an indicator of poor prognosis. To date, no prospective studies have been performed to evaluate the radiation sensitivity and treatment outcomes of patients with uterine cervical carcinoma relative to HER2 and HIF-1alpha expressions. We conducted a prospective evaluation of HER2 and HIF-1alpha in cases of locally advanced uterine cervical carcinoma treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. METHODS: Between June 2005 and April 2008, 25 patients with locally advanced uterine cervical carcinoma were registered in this study, KGROG0501. Their clinical stages were Ib2/IIb/IIIb/IVa in 1/2/22/1 cases, respectively. Nineteen cases had squamous cell carcinoma and six had adenocarcinoma. HER2 expression and HIF-1alpha expression were analyzed using an immunohistochemical kit on pretreatment biopsied specimens. HIF-1alpha expression was studied using another commercial immunohistochemical kit on pretreatment biopsied specimens. The survival rates were compared between patients with and without positive HER2 and HIF-1alpha expressions. RESULTS: The 20-month survival of HER2(-) and HIF-1alpha(-) cases (n = 6) was 100% and that of HER2(+) and HIF-1alpha(+) cases (n = 4) was 37.5% (p = 0.0032). CONCLUSIONS: In this first prospective analysis of patients with uterine cervical carcinoma treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, concomitant expression of HER2 and HIF-1alpha was suggested to be a strong indicator of poor prognosis. A novel therapy including molecular targeted therapy such as anti-HER2 and anti-HIF-1alpha may be worth considering in patients with concomitant expression of HER2 and HIF-1alpha.",cancer
"Pregnancy-associated breast cancer--a review analysis. The aim of the present review was to assess the relationship between pregnancy and/or lactation and breast cancer, the influence of pregnancy on mortality and prognosis of the disease, the consequences of breast cancer to the current pregnancy and also to discuss the future perspective for women's fertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles were obtained from Medline (1988 present) using as keywords breast cancer, pregnancy, breastfeeding, lactation, carcinoma and pregnancy. RESULTS: Unfortunately, delays in diagnosis and treatment are common during pregnancy and the prognosis is thus worsened. Nulliparity, early menarche and late age at first pregnancy are associated with increased risk for breast cancer. Breastfeeding confers a protective effect on risk of breast cancer, which appears to be related to the duration of breastfeeding. In cases of advanced metastatic disease during the first 14 to 15 weeks of pregnancy when chemotherapy is necessary for prompt treatment, termination of pregnancy may be proposed, particularly if the patient is ER-positive. Modified radical mastectomy is probably the procedure most frequently used today. In general chemotherapy should be delayed until after 14 to 15 weeks of gestation and radiation should be reserved until post delivery. Several authorities generally advise that future pregnancy should be delayed for at least two years after breast cancer treatment. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer has an equivalent prognosis in pregnant and non pregnant patients when matched by age and stage at diagnosis. Women are invariably best treated by multidisciplinary teams.",cancer
"CTLA4-induced splenomegaly and a review of the literature pertaining to autoimmune complications of therapy. CTLA4-blocking antibodies induce tumor regression in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma by optimizing T-cell activity to fight the malignant cells. In addition to therapeutic benefits, CTLA4 therapy may induce immune-related adverse events (irAE). Studies on CTLA4 knockout and other CTLA4 deficient mice have resulted in splenomegaly, lymphoproliferation and fatal multi-organ destruction. The authors present a case of a 68-year-old patient who has developed splenomegaly following CTLA4 therapy. CTLA4 therapy's risks and benefits should be weighed carefully in the treatment of malignant melanoma. Larger prospective multi-center trials are needed to gauge the efficacy and complication rate of CTLA4 therapy. The authors propose that patients should get short-term surveillance imaging (CT or PET/CT) to exclude the multiple abdominopelvic complications and quickly terminate therapy if clinically warranted. It is also necessary for clinicians to carefully monitor for the number of possible complications associated with this immunotherapy.",cancer
"Dendritic cells and T cells in immunotherapy. Autologous cellular immunotherapies have been used experimentally in humans to treat many types of cancer. These therapies are divided into two principal types: active cellular immunotherapies that rely on autologous dendritic cells or other antigen presenting cells; and adoptive T-cell therapies, in which large numbers of antigen-specific T lymphocytes are propagated ex vivo and then infused back into the patient. With the FDA approval of the antigen presenting cell vaccine sipuleucel-T for prostate cancer, active immunization has become an accepted approach for the treatment of established cancer.",cancer
"TH17 is involved in the remarkable regression of metastatic malignant melanoma to topical diphencyprone. The authors provide an update on a previously reported patient with in-transit metastatic melanoma of the scalp treated with topical diphencyprone (DPCP). Molecular studies implicate the thymus-derived TH17 lymphocyte subset in a remarkable immunotherapeutic regression. The authors performed RT-PCR of total RNA from paraffin-embedded tissue before and after treatment with DPCP. Before treatment with DPCP, the authors found elevated expression of IL 17C/D/E/F; after treatment there was no detectable expression. Conversely, increased expression of PLZF/CD27 and CTLA4 was seen after treatment with no expression before treatment. No expression of IL17A/B, CD7, RORgTand FoxP3 were before or after treatment. Conclusions are limited to only the time samples were obtained. Remarkable regression of an in-transit metastatic melanoma treated with the immunomodulatory agent DPCP showed gain and loss of gene expression of the TH17 pathway. Further study of this pathway from NK to NK-T to TH7 and TH1 cells both with and without accessory or dendritic cells will improve understanding of contact sensitizers as topical immunomodulators.",cancer

"IL-2-activated haploidentical NK cells restore NKG2D-mediated NK-cell cytotoxicity in neuroblastoma patients by scavenging of plasma MICA. NK group 2D (NKG2D)-expressing NK cells exhibit cytolytic activity against various tumors after recognition of the cellular ligand MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA). However, release of soluble MICA (sMICA) compromises NKG2D-dependent NK-cell cytotoxicity leading to tumor escape from immunosurveillance. Although some molecular details of the NKG2D-MICA interaction have been elucidated, its impact for donor NK (dNK) cell-based therapy of solid tumors has not been studied. Within an ongoing phase I/II trial, we used allogeneic IL-2 activated dNK cells after haploidentical stem cell transplantation for immunotherapy of patients with high-risk stage IV neuroblastoma. NKG2D levels on activated dNK cells increased strongly when compared with freshly isolated dNK cells and correlated with enhanced NK-cell cytotoxicity. Most importantly, elevated sMICA levels in patients plasma correlated significantly with impaired dNK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This effect could be reversed by high-dose infusion of activated dNK cells, which display high levels of surface NKG2D. Our data suggest that the provided excess of NKG2D leads to clearance of sMICA and preserves cytotoxicity of dNK cells via non-occupied NKG2D. In conclusion, our results identify this tumor immune escape mechanism as a target to improve immunotherapy of neuroblastoma and presumably other tumors.",cancer
"The biology of myeloid-derived suppressor cells: the blessing and the curse of morphological and functional heterogeneity. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) play an important role in the cellular network regulating immune responses in cancer, chronic infectious diseases, autoimmunity, and in other pathological conditions. Morphological, phenotypic and functional heterogeneity is a hallmark of MDSC. This heterogeneity demonstrates the plasticity of this immune suppressive myeloid compartment, and shows how various tumors and infectious agents can have similar biological effects on myeloid cells despite the differences in the factors that they produce to influence the immune system; however, such a heterogeneity creates ambiguity in the definition of MDSC as well as confusion regarding the origin and fate of these cells. In this review, we will discuss recent findings that help to better clarify these issues and to determine the place of MDSC within the myeloid cell lineage.",cancer
"Tephrosin-induced autophagic cell death in A549 non-small cell lung cancer cells. Anticancer effect of tephrosin (1) has been documented; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity of tephrosin in cancer cells remain unclear. In the present paper, the proliferation inhibition rate of several cancer cells was tested using the MTT assay; cell cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were determined by flow cytometry; poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) expression were evaluated by Western blotting; autophagy was examined by confocal microscopy and light chain 3 (LC3) conversion assay. The results showed that exposure of the cells to tephrosin induced significant proliferation inhibition in a dose-dependent manner, especially on A549 with G(2)/M being arrested. Tephrosin was not found to induce cell apoptosis as PARP cleavage was not detected after 24 h treatment, but the formation of acidic vesicular organelle of autophagy character was found, and autophagy was further confirmed by the increase in the ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I. It was observed that tephrosin induced ROS generation and Hsp90 expression inhibition. These results indicate that tephrosin induces A549 cancer cell death via the autophagy pathway, and the roles of ROS generation and Hsp90 expression inhibition in this process need further study in the future.",cancer
"Nasal myoepithelioma removed through endonasal endoscopic surgery: a case report. Myoepithelioma is a rare neoplasm that can occur in either the major or minor salivary gland and accounts for less than 1% of salivary gland neoplasms. We report a rare case of a nasal myoepithelioma that originated from the nasal inferior turbinate. The tumor, measuring 50 x 30 x 20 mm, was in the right nasal cavity and had a necrotic surface. We removed the tumor through endonasal endoscopic surgery. The tumor had spindle-shaped cells and was positive for cytokeratin, (AE1/AE3), vimentin, S-100beta, and MIB-1 but was negative for CD34, desmin, neuron-specific enolase, and synaptophysin. Slight immunoreactivity for smooth muscle actin was noted in some tumor cells. There has been no evidence of tumor recurrence in the 18 months following surgery.",cancer
"Extrahepatic portal venous obstruction due to a giant hepatic hemangioma associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. We describe a patient with extrahepatic portal venous obstruction due to a giant hepatic hemangioma associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. A 67-year-old woman presented with upper abdominal distension and appetite loss. The medical history was not relevant to the current disorder. Initial laboratory tests revealed the following: serum platelet count, 9.9 x 10(4)/microL; serum fibrinogen degradation products, 12 microg/mL; prothrombin time, 1.26; and serum fibrinogen, 111 mg/dL. Computed tomography demonstrated homogenous low-density areas, 15 cm in diameter, in the left lobe of the liver. Common hepatic arteriography revealed a hypervascular tumor with pooling of contrast medium in the delayed phase. The portal venous phase of supramesenteric arteriography revealed obstruction and cavernous transformation of the portal vein. We diagnosed extrahepatic portal venous obstruction due to a giant hepatic hemangioma associated with Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. Laparotomy was performed, and the liver was found to be markedly enlarged. After mobilization of the left lobe, left hepatectomy was performed with intermittent clamping. After resection, Doppler ultrasonography revealed recovery of the portal venous flow. The cavernous transformation shrank. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the presence of a giant benign hepatic cavernous hemangioma. The patient was discharged 16 days after operation. Laboratory data and complications improved after 2 months.",cancer
"Stem cell transplantation using non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with fludarabine for hematological malignancies. Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a useful treatment for hematological malignancies, but it is limited to younger patients because of its high treatment-related mortality. Fludarabine (Flu), a novel anticancer agent with potent immunosuppressive activity, used as a conditioning regimen (reduced intensity transplantation; RIST), can decrease treatment-related mortality, as recently reported. However, the best drug combination and the best timing for RIST remain unknown. We herein report the SCT outcomes of 36 patients undergoing Flu treatment at our institution since December 2002 and retrospectively analyze the results. RIST conditioning with Flu was well-tolerated. No severe toxicity related conditioning regimens was observed in our patients, even though there were 10 patients with a history of autologous (n = 5) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 5). Hematological engraftment was found in 33 patients. The median times for reconstitution of WBCs, RBCs, and platelets were 16 days, 27.5 days and 34 days, respectively. Stable complete donor chimerism after SCT was present in all patients with WBC engraftment, and no patients experienced late rejection. Thirty-two patients were evaluated for acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD). Nine patients had no aGVHD. The incidence of grade I/II and III/IV aGVHD was 78% and 22%, respectively. Skin lesions were the major sites of involvement. Gut involvement was present in 9 patients. All 4 patients with grade IV GVHD had stage four hepatic GVHD. Twenty-two patients were analyzed for chronic GVHD (cGVHD). Twelve patients had no cGVHD, 6 had limited type and 4 had extended type. The overall survival (OS), relapse rate (RR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) in all patients over 7 years were found to be 41.7%, 20.1%, and 34.6%, respectively. Induction failures were present in 5 cases of AML and 1 case of NHL. Disease progression was the primary cause of death, which occurred in 12 of 21 patients. Six patients died of grade IV GVHD (n = 2) or complicated fungal infection contracted during the GVHD treatment (n = 4). One patient died of secondary MSD, which originated from donor hematopoietic cells. Two patients died of cerebral bleeding and cardiac rapture, respectively. We found that the patients' state on SCT was the most important factor in long-term survival. The OS of standard risk and high risk patients with hematological malignancies were 75% and 30.3%. We concluded that stem cell transplantation using a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen with Flu was a useful therapeutic approach for patients with hematological malignancies.",cancer
"Target delineation of gross tumor volume for radiation therapy planning using fusion images of (1)(8)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and computed tomography. Modern radiation therapy planning (RTP) has been performed using a larger number of images obtained with computed tomography (CT), named 3-dimensional RTP. Recently, F-18-flurodeoxyglucose position emission tomography (FDG-PET) has been used for RTP. FDG-PET can often distinguish between benign and malignant lesions when CT and magnetic resonance cannot. Although FDG-PET images lack anatomical precision (Fig. 1A), fusion images of FDG-PET and CT (PET/CT) have been extremely useful for determining the active sites of malignant disease. Particularly for patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma, both primary lesions and active lymph node matastases are well recognized (Fig. 1B). With PET/CT, which yields fewer false-negative results, smaller target volumes for radiation therapy can be delineated than with other imaging modalities (Fig. 2). The small radiation field (Fig. 3) leads to less toxicity in normal tissue, allows high radiation dose to be administered, and improves local control.",cancer
"Ionizing radiation exposure to patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction in the United States. BACKGROUND: Invasive and noninvasive cardiovascular imaging is beneficial in the care of patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction. Little is known about patients' cumulative radiation exposure. METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients admitted with an acute myocardial infarction to any of 49 University HealthSystem Consortium member hospitals from 2006 to 2009 were reviewed for inpatient procedures involving ionizing radiation that included chest radiograph, computed tomogram scans, radionuclide imaging, diagnostic cardiac catheterization, and percutaneous coronary intervention. The average cumulative effective radiation dose per patient was estimated on the basis of published typical effective radiation doses for imaging procedures. Patients (n=64 071) admitted for acute myocardial infarction had a median age of 64.9 years. A total of 276 651 procedures involving ionizing radiation were performed during the study period, a median of 4.3 procedures per patient per admission. The majority of patients had invasive catheterization (77%), followed by computed tomogram scans (52%), mostly body examinations. The median cumulative effective radiation dose delivered was 15.02 mSv per patient per acute myocardial infarction admission. Postprocedural bleeding was a significant predictor of radiation exposure (odds ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.85 to 2.18), together with postprocedural mechanical complications resulting from device implantation (odds ratio, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 2.61 to 3.13). Patients with higher underlying clinical complexity (defined by severity of illness scores) had higher radiation exposure and higher mortality (P<0.0001). There was also significant geographic variation in radiation exposure; patients in New England received the lowest cumulative exposure (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Acute myocardial infarction inpatients are exposed to an approximate median radiation dose of 15 mSv. This exposure is a result of multiple cardiovascular and noncardiovascular procedures. Efforts should be made to understand the risks and benefits of radiation exposure per episode of care for acute myocardial infarction.",cancer
"Irradiation toxic effects during intra-arterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma: should we be concerned? OBJECTIVE: To evaluate irradiation toxic effects from fluoroscopy during intra-arterial chemotherapy for retinoblastoma. DESIGN: Prospective trial. PARTICIPANTS: Eight patients treated with intra-arterial chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Irradiation toxic effects in vital organs. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 29 months (range, 10-74 months) and 63% were male. The mean irradiation dose to the skin of the affected eye was 0.19173 Gy, to the contralateral eye was 0.03533 Gy, to the chest wall was 0.00296 Gy, and to the abdominal wall was 0.00104 Gy. The estimated irradiation dose to the lens in the treatment eye was 0.16 Gy, which, in accumulated doses, could be cataractogenic. The estimated irradiation dose from a single fluoroscopy session to other organs, including the brain (0.05560 Gy), thyroid (0.00192 Gy), bone marrow (0.00059 Gy), and gonads (0.00015 Gy), was far lower than the minimal toxic level. CONCLUSIONS: Careful use of fluoroscopy during intra-arterial chemotherapy with limited irradiation exposure is advised. Accumulated irradiation toxic effects following multiple sessions of intra-arterial chemotherapy could be cataractogenic and possibly carcinogenic, especially in irradiation-sensitive patients with retinoblastoma.",cancer
"Clinical significance of molecular biomarkers in glioblastoma. AIM: To review the impact of molecular biomarkers on response to therapy and survival in patients with primary glioblastoma (GBM). MATERIALS & METHODS: Tissue specimens were analyzed for p53 mutations, EGFR amplification, loss of PTEN and p16, and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation. Demographic and clinical data were gathered from medical records. RESULTS: Clinical and pathological data of 125 patients were collected and analysed. MGMT promoter methylation was associated with improved median overall survival (OS) (61 vs. 42 weeks, p = 0.01) and was an important prognosticator independent of age at diagnosis, extent of resection and post-operative ECOG performance status (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.11-3.75). Among patients with MGMT promoter methylation, survival was significantly improved with chemoradiotherapy (CRT) over radiotherapy (RT) alone (71 vs. 14 weeks, p < 0.01). Furthermore, amongst those treated with temozolomide (TMZ) based CRT, the presence of EGFR amplification, maintenance of PTEN and wild-type p53 and p16 were each associated with trends towards improved survival. CONCLUSION: MGMT promoter methylation is a strong, independent prognostic factor for OS in GBM. EGFR amplification, maintenance of PTEN, wild-type p53 and p16 all appear to be associated with improved survival in patients treated with CRT. However, the prognostic value of these biomarkers could not be ascertained and larger prospective studies are warranted.",cancer
"Involvement of mitochondrial pathway in NCTD-induced cytotoxicity in human hepG2 cells. BACKGROUND: Norcantharidin, the demethylated analog of cantharidin derived from a traditional Chinese medicine, Mylabris, has been used in the treatment of anti-cancer effects. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process are generally unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of NCTD-induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. METHODS: The cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay for cellular viability and by flow cytometry. The mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species production was evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. The role of caspase activities were assayed using caspase apoptosis detection kit . Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the level of Cyto-C, Bcl-2, Bax, Bid, caspase 3, -9, -8 and PARP expression RESULTS: After treatment with NCTD, a decrease in the viability of HepG2 cells and increase in apoptosis were observed. NCTD-induced apoptosis was accompanied by an increase in ROS production, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and release of cytochrome c(cyto-c) from the mitochondria to the cytosol and down-regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 levels with concurrent up-regulation in pro-apoptotic protein Bax levels. However, another pro-apoptotic molecule, Bid, showed no change in such same treatment. NCTD-increased activity of caspase 9,caspase 3 and the subsequent cleavage caspase substrate PARP were also observed. The expression levels of pro-caspase-8 were not changed after NCTD treatment. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that NCTD induced cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells by apoptosis, which is mediated through ROS generation and mitochondrial pathway.",cancer
"Health consequences of Chernobyl: the New York Academy of Sciences publishes an antidote to the nuclear establishment's pseudo-science. In February 2010, the New York Academy of Sciences published the most complete and up-to-date collection of evidence, from independent, scientific sources all over the world, on the health and environmental consequences of the Chernobyl accident. For 24 years, through a high-level, internationally coordinated cover-up of the world's most serious industrial accident, the nuclear lobby has deprived the world of a unique and critically important source of scientific information. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), mouthpiece of the nuclear establishment, has coordinated the cover-up through the dissemination and imposition of crude pseudo-science. Regrettably, the World Health Organization, a U.N. agency on which the world's people rely for guidance, is subordinate to the IAEA in matters of radiation and health, has participated in the cover-up, and stands accused of non-assistance to populations in danger. The new book on Chernobyl makes available huge amounts of evidence from independent studies undertaken in the affected countries, unique and valuable data that have been ignored by the international health establishment. This comprehensive account of the full dimensions of the catastrophe reveals the shameful inadequacy of current international assistance to the affected populations. It also demonstrates, once more, that future energy options cannot include nuclear power.",cancer
"Mucoepidermoid carcinoma of a nasal cavity--a rare tumour. BACKGROUNDS: Mucoepidermoid tumours arise from the ductal cells of the salivary glands, most commonly the parotid. The occurrence of these tumours in the mucus glands of the air passages is extremely rare. They are very aggressive tumours with poor prognosis. CASE: A case of nasal mucoepidermoid carcinoma with probable origin from the middle turbinate is reported. CONCLUSION: Nasal mucoepidermoid carcinomas are extremely rare. They usually present with symptoms similar to sinusitis. When dealing with a recurrent/aggressive tumour in the ethmoids, the possibility of mucoepidermoid carcinoma can be considered in the differential diagnosis. They are aggressive tumours with a poor prognosis.",cancer
"Czech National Cancer Screening Programmes in 2010. BACKGROUNDS: All three cancer screening programmes recommended by the Council of the EU are available to defined target age groups in the Czech Republic. Organized programmes for screening of breast, colorectal and cervical cancer have been initiated in the last decade. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A system for information support, as an essential component of organized screening programmes, has been implemented in all screening programmes. It comprises the Czech National Cancer Registry to monitor the cancer burden and population impact of the programmes, the National Reference Centre as a provider of nationwide insurance claims data, and the specialised databases of all three programmes, which collect information on screening, diagnostics and final diagnoses. RESULTS: Early diagnostics of malignant neoplasms and progress in therapy have helped to stabilize mortality, even in diagnoses with increasing incidence. The coverage of the Czech screening programmes has constantly been rising; however, it is still insufficient: 51.2%, 17.9% and 48.4% of the target population was covered at the end of 2008 in breast, colorectal and cervical screening programmes, respectively. In 2008, a total of 468,419 women underwent screening mammography and 2,128 tumours were detected (4.5 per 1,000 screened). According to the screening colonoscopy registry, more than 13,000 men and women underwent preventive colonoscopy in 2009, 4,085 patients were diagnosed with adenoma and 619 with colorectal cancer, mostly in the early stages. The information system for cervical screening was implemented in 2009 and has been running in pilot mode; the first results are expected at the end of 2010. CONCLUSION: The system for information support within organised cancer screening programmes enables monitoring of the performance of screening and diagnostic centres and thus helps to maintain continuous quality improvements, which are a necessary presumption for replicating the promising results of clinical trials. To achieve a substantial impact on population incidence and mortality, a large increase in test coverage in target populations will be necessary. The programmes should be transformed to a population-based form, which involves inviting all people in the target population to be screened.",cancer
"Cancer incidence and mortality in the Czech Republic. BACKGROUNDS: The Czech Republic is ranked among those countries with the highest cancer burden in Europe and worldwide. The purpose of this study is to summarize long-term trends in the cancer burden and to provide up-to-date estimates of incidence and mortality rates from 2007. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Czech National Cancer Registry (CNCR) was instituted in 1977 and contains information over a 30-year period of standardized registration covering 100% of cancer diagnoses and the entire Czech population. The analysis of CNCR is supported by demographic data of the Czech Republic and by the Death Records Database as civil registration systems. The epidemiology of malignant tumours in the Czech population is available online at www.svod.cz. RESULTS: All neoplasms, including non-melanoma skin cancer, reached a crude incidence rate of almost 736 cases per 100,000 men and 648 cases per 100,000 women in 2007. The annual mortality rate exceeded 263 deaths per 100,000 population; each year, more than 27,000 persons die of cancer. The overall incidence of malignancies has increased during the last decade with growth index + 26.4% (1997-2007) while the mortality rate has stabilized over this time span (growth index in 1977-2007: -2.5%). Consequently, the prevalence has significantly increased in the registration period and in 2007 it exceeded 400,000 cases. In addition to the demographic ageing of the Czech population, the cancer burden is increased by the growing incidence of multiple primary tumours (recently more than 11% of the total incidence). The most frequent diagnoses include colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Although some neoplasms are increasingly diagnosed at an early stage (e.g. proportion of stage I + II in female breast cancer: 71.9%, skin melanoma: 81.3%), in general early diagnostics is insufficient in the Czech Republic. This is the case even for highly prevalent colorectal carcinoma (only 43.2% of incident cases recently diagnosed at stage I or II). CONCLUSION: The Czech Republic is well equipped with high-quality and functional facilities for collecting and analysing population-based data on malignant tumours. The data survey has enabled the priorities of cancer management in the Czech Republic to be defined. This will undoubtedly lead to a sustained reduction in late diagnosed cases and a reduction in the remarkable regional differences in diagnostic efficiency.",cancer
"Subclinical cardiac dysfunction and exercise performance in childhood cancer survivors. BACKGROUND: Although anthracycline cardiotoxicity is clearly related to the cumulative dose administered, subclinical cardiac dysfunction has been reported across a wide range of treatment regimens, and its clinical significance is still unclear. Purpose of this study is to investigate by exercise echocardiography for subclinical cardiac dysfunction in survivors of pediatric cancer treated with low-moderate anthracycline doses, and to evaluate whether it may alter the response of the cardiovascular system to dynamic exercise. PROCEDURE: Post-exercise left ventricular end-systolic wall stress (ESS), left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent thickening at end systole, and cardiopulmonary exercise test-derived indexes of cardiac function were examined in 55 apparently healthy patients (mean age 13.5 +/- 2.9 years, median anthracycline cumulative dose 240 mg/m(2)) and in 63 controls. RESULTS: Subclinical cardiac dysfunction was identified in 17 patients (30%) presenting reduced left ventricular posterior wall dimension or percent thickening, or increased values of left ventricular ESS as compared to controls (group A), while the remaining patients formed group B. Reduced oxygen consumption at peak exercise in both groups of patients was the only cardiopulmonary exercise test variable resulting significantly different between patients and controls: no differences were found among the groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that even patients treated with a median anthracycline dose of 240 mg/m(2) (range 100-490) are at considerable risk of exhibiting subclinical cardiac dysfunction that, however, does not seem to alter the physiologic response of the cardiovascular system to dynamic exercise.",cancer
"CD34+ immunoselection of autologous grafts for the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma. BACKGROUND: Graft contamination has been blamed for causing relapse in children with high-risk neuroblastoma (HRNB) after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PROCEDURE: We report the long-term results of hematopoietic reconstitution, post-transplant complications, and clinical outcome of 44 children with HRNB treated with busulfan/melphalan high-dose chemotherapy followed by transplantation of purged CD34+ immunoselected autologous peripheral HSCT. Minimal residual disease (MRD) of grafts was evaluated by anti-GD2 immunofluorescence or tyrosine hydroxylase reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Contaminating neuroblasts were found in 19/38 grafts (50%) before CD34+ positive selection, and none after (technique sensitivity of one cell in 10(5)). A median of 6.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range 0.8-23.7) were transplanted with only 2% of TRM. Neutrophils and platelet recovery occurred within a median of 12 days (range 9-47) and 44 days (range 12-259), respectively, without any secondary graft failure. Twenty-three percents of patients experienced a sepsis (10/44) and 14% a pyelonephritis (6/44). Recurrence of varicella zoster virus occurred in 21% of patients (9/44). Negative RT-PCR MRD within the leukapheresis product and cis-retinoic acid therapy were significantly and independently associated to a better survival (P < 0.05). Overall and event-free survivals at 5 years post-transplant were at 59.3% and 48.3% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Besides high rates of manageable infections due to late immune recovery, transplantation with CD34+ immunoselected grafts in HRNB children was feasible and did not affect long-term hematopoiesis.",cancer
"Cyclophosphamide monotherapy in children with Burkitt lymphoma: a study from the French-African Pediatric Oncology Group (GFAOP). BACKGROUND: The French African Group of Pediatric Oncology was set-up to improve quality of care for children with cancer. Preliminary observations on the efficacy in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) of a cyclophosphamide monotherapy (CPM) have been published. We report the results of a multicentric prospective study combining first-line CPM and a multidrug second-line chemotherapy (SC) for refractory/relapsed patients. PROCEDURE: Patients </= 18 years with Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphoma, were included in six countries (Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Madagascar, Mali, and Senegal). All patients received three weekly CPM courses (1.2 g/m(2) IV with intrathecal methotrexate and hydrocortisone), stage 3/4 patients received three further courses. SC added methotrexate, vincristine, cytarabine, and prednisone. RESULTS: There were 178 patients included (42 stage 1/2, 134 stage 3/4, and 2 unknown). Isolated facial localization was found in 41 patients, diffuse abdominal involvement in 120 patients including 65 with both. Nine early deaths were reported, toxicity occurred in 136/743 courses (83 patients) and was predominantly hematological. After CPM, complete remission (CR) rate was 47% with a 33% EFS. Because of rapid progression 76/108 eligible patients (85 primary refractory and 23 relapses) received SC resulting in 35.7% CR but a 21% toxic death rate. The OS of the whole strategy was 50.5% and correlated to stage. CONCLUSION: A prospective multicentric study on BL was feasible in very low-income countries. CPM can be recommended in stage 1-2 because of optimal cost/benefit ratio. However, more intensive strategies, still adapted to socio-economic conditions, are required for advanced stages 3 and 4.",cancer
"Mullerian inhibiting substance inhibits invasion and migration of epithelial cancer cell lines. OBJECTIVE: Given the fact that Mullerian Inhibiting Substance (MIS) causes complex remodeling of the urogenital ridge and regression of the Mullerian ducts during male embryonic development, we examined whether MIS could affect similar cell properties such as migration and invasion that could contribute ultimately to micro-metastasis of cancers arising from Mullerian tissues. MIS receptor expressing cell lines found to be invasive and migratory in vivo are examined in an in vivo assay that is cost-effective. METHODS: We designed in vitro and in vivo experiments to determine if MIS inhibited the movement of cancer lines IGROV-1, HEp3, MDA-MB-231, and HT1080 in cell culture invasion/migration chamber assays and in chick embryo metastasis assays. RESULTS: MIS, at concentrations below those that inhibit cell proliferation, blocked in vitro invasion and in vivo migration of epithelial cancer cells that express the MIS receptor. CONCLUSIONS: While our laboratory has previously established MIS as an inhibitor of cancer cell proliferation using in vitro assays and in vivo xenografts, we now show that MIS can also inhibit in vivo tumor migration.",cancer
"Distinctive DNA methylation patterns of cell-free plasma DNA in women with malignant ovarian tumors. OBJECTIVE: Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (OvCa) is rarely detected early, and it is also difficult to determine whether an adnexal mass is benign or malignant. Previously, we noted differences in methylation patterns of cell-free plasma DNA (cfpDNA) in women without disease compared to patients with OvCa. In this work, we investigated whether methylation patterns of cfpDNA can differentiate between benign and malignant tumors. METHODS: Methylation patterns in cfpDNA were determined in three cohorts (30 samples each) using a microarray-based assay (MethDet 56). Principal component analysis, supervised clustering, linear discrimination analysis, and 25 rounds of 5-fold cross-validation were used to determine informative genes and assess the sensitivity and specificity of differentiating between OvCa vs. healthy control (HC), benign ovarian disease (mostly serous cystadenoma, BOD) vs. HC, and OvCa vs. BOD samples. RESULTS: Differential methylation of three promoters (RASSF1A, CALCA, and EP300) differentiated between OvCa vs. HC with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 86.7%. Three different promoters (BRCA1, CALCA, and CDKN1C) were informative for differentiating between BOD vs. HC, with a sensitivity of 90.0% and a specificity of 76.7%. Finally, two promoters (RASSF1A and PGR-PROX) were informative for differentiating between OvCa vs. BOD, with a sensitivity of 80.0% and a specificity of 73.3%. CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-principle data show that differential methylation of promoters in cfpDNA may be a useful biomarker to differentiate between certain benign and malignant ovarian tumors.",cancer
"Her-2/neu expression in testicular cancer--a retrospective analysis in 57 cases. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate her-2/neu expression in testicular germ cell tumors (GCT). METHODS: In patients with primary GCT her-2/neu expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Furthermore, gene amplification was analyzed by chromogene in situ hybridization (CISH). For interpretation, the most recent Asco Guidelines were used. RESULTS: The expression patterns were analyzed according to the histologic subtype. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a weak (score 1) to moderate expression (score 2) in 1% of GCT; none of the GCT revealed a score 3 expression profile. By CISH analysis, we did not observe any gene amplification in the 57 GCT. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of her-2/neu expression in primary testicular cancer is of no therapeutic relevance. However, for the future we will explore the expression of her-2/neu in residual masses after chemotherapy to assess the role of targeted therapy in chemoresistant metastases.",cancer
"Zoledronic Acid improves clinical outcomes when administered before onset of bone pain in patients with prostate cancer. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate, in an exploratory analysis, the effect of zoledronic acid (ZOL) on skeletal-related event (SRE) incidence as determined by the bone pain levels at study entry. Bone metastases can undermine skeletal integrity long before the onset of symptoms. Treating patients before symptom onset might be more effective in preventing SREs and improving patients' quality of life. ZOL has shown significant reductions in SREs and pain compared with placebo in patients with bone metastases from advanced prostate cancer in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. METHODS: Patients from a placebo-controlled, Phase III trial of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer, randomized to receive ZOL 4 mg (n = 214) or placebo (n = 208) for </= 24 months, were stratified by pain or no pain at baseline. Bone pain was assessed at baseline, week 3, and week 6 and at 6-week intervals thereafter. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with >/= 1 SRE. RESULTS: ZOL significantly reduced the mean pain scores compared with placebo at 3, 9, 21, and 24 months (P </= .03 for each point) and reduced the annual incidence of SREs. Among patients without baseline pain, ZOL decreased the percentage of patients with >/= 1 SRE by 39% and reduced the annual incidence of SREs by 49% compared with placebo. ZOL delayed the onset of bone pain in those patients without pain at baseline compared with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: ZOL reduced bone pain and SREs compared with placebo in patients with bone metastases from castration-resistant prostate cancer, irrespective of the baseline pain status, and appeared more efficacious when initiated before the onset of pain.",cancer
"An open-label, single-arm Phase II study of intravenous weekly (Days 1 and 8) topotecan in combination with carboplatin (Day 1) every 21 days as second-line therapy in patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate clinical activity of weekly topotecan plus carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal carcinoma. METHODS: An open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase I/II study. Phase II was the activity assessment phase, with overall response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint. Eligible patients (females aged >/=18 years) received study treatment at the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) identified in Phase I: intravenous topotecan 2.5mg/m(2) (Days 1 and 8), followed by carboplatin AUC 5 (Day 1), every 21 days. A two-stage Green-Dahlberg design was used to assess efficacy of treatment. An ORR of </=30% was required to conclude that treatment was ineffective. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients in Phase I permitted identification of the MTD. In Phase II, 55 patients (median age 64.0 years) were enrolled and included in the intent-to-treat population. There were six complete responses (10.9%) and 11 partial responses (20.0%), giving an ORR of 30.9% (17 patients; 95% CI: 18.7%, 43.1%). Median time to response and progression-free survival were 6.57 weeks (95% CI: 5.86, 12.57) and 44.29 weeks (95% CI: 36.14, 52.14), respectively. Grade 3/4 hematological toxicity caused dose reductions, treatment delays and study discontinuation. Neutropenia (Grade 3: 29%; Grade 4: 11%) was the most common hematological adverse event (AE). Fatigue (71%) and nausea (71%) were the most common drug-related non-hematologic AEs. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an acceptable benefit-risk profile for topotecan plus carboplatin. Further studies using alternative dose levels could help define an optimal dosing schedule for this treatment combination in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent disease.",cancer
"Surgical management of recurrent ovarian cancer: the advantage of collaborative surgical management and a multidisciplinary approach. OBJECTIVE: Primary cytoreductive surgery is well accepted in the initial management of ovarian cancer with a goal of maximal tumor reduction. The role of cytoreductive surgery at disease recurrence is controversial and guidelines are not standardized. We aimed to review cases of women with recurrent ovarian cancer who were collaboratively managed by two teams of oncologic surgeons with different areas of surgical expertise. METHODS: A list of 616 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer from 1995 to 2009 was generated at a single institution. 20 cases of recurrent ovarian cancer were identified that were managed collaboratively. Data collected included date of diagnosis, initial treatment, recurrence date, location and number of sites of recurrence, secondary cytoreductive procedure performed, residual disease after surgery, pre-operative status, post-operative course, and pathologic findings. RESULTS: Of the 20 cases that fit eligibility criteria, 11 were completely resected, 5 were incompletely resected, and 4 were biopsied only. Median disease-free interval following primary surgery was 18 months (6-147). Median interval from diagnosis to collaborative cytoreduction was 63 months (13-170). Our patients had metastatic disease to the liver (11), lymph nodes (8), the diaphragm (7), other locations including colon, pancreas, lung, adrenal, kidney (9). Two patients had additional miliary disease. All patients underwent joint surgical management by gynecologic and surgical oncologists. There were no deaths in the immediate post-operative period. The 5 year survival rate was 45% following the joint surgical effort, with a median post-collaborative surgery survival duration of 42 months. CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies document survival benefit of surgery for women with recurrent ovarian cancer when there has been a long disease-free interval, localized pelvic or intra-abdominal recurrences and an optimal performance status. Most gynecologic oncologists do not perform extensive liver or diaphragm resections or lymph node excision above the renal vessels; thus, collaboration with a surgical oncologist is a viable option. In this small descriptive study, the feasibility of this reasonably well-tolerated approach, with possible survival benefit, is documented.",cancer
"Expressions and clinical significances of CD133 protein and CD133 mRNA in primary lesion of gastric adenocacinoma. BACKGROUND: To study on expressions and clinical significances of CD133 protein and CD133 mRNA in primary lesion of gastric adenocarcinoma (GC). METHODS: Expressions of CD133 protein by immunostaining (99 cases) and CD133 mRNA by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (31 cases) were detected in primary lesion and in noncancerous gastric mucosa tissue (NCGT). Correlations of CD133 protein expression with clinicopathological parameters and post-operative survival were analyzed. Relations of CD133 mRNA level with Ki-67 labeling index (LI), and lymphatic metastasis were assessed too. RESULTS: Brown particles indicating CD133 protein positivity occurred in some parts of tumor cells and epithelium. Expressive percentage of CD133 protein positivity was significantly higher in subgroups with >5 cm diameter (P = 0.041), later TNM stage (P = 0.044), severer lymph node metastasis (P = 0.017), occurrences of lymphatic invasion (P = 0.000) and vascular invasion (P = 0.000) respectively. Severer invasion depth (P = 0.011), lymph node metastasis occurrence (P = 0.043) and later TNM stage (P = 0.049) were the independent risk factors for CD133 protein expression. Average brightness scale value (BSV) of CD133 mRNA was significantly higher in subgroups with >5 cm diameter (P = 0.041), lymph node metastasis occurrence (P = 0.004) and in lower Ki-67 LI (P = 0.02). Relative analysis revealed that BSV of CD133 mRNA related positively to metastatic lymphatic nodes ratio (P = 0.008) and metastatic lymph node number (P = 0.009), but negatively to Ki-67 LI (P = 0.009). Survival of positive subgroup of CD 133 protein was significantly poorer (P = 0.047). Lymph node metastasis occurrence (P = 0.042), later TNM stage (P = 0.046) and CD 133 protein positive expression (P = 0.046) were respectively the independent risk factors to survival. CONCLUSION: Higher expressive level of CD133 mRNA is associated to lower Ki-67 LI and severer lymphatic metastasis. Therefore, the expressive level of CD133 mRNA can play an appropriate role to reflect the status of lymph node metastasis and proliferation of GC. CD133 protein expression is closely related with larger tumor, later TNM stage, lymphtic metastasis and survival of GC.",cancer
"Biomarkers discovery in cancer--up-dates in methodology. Biomarkers are biomolecules that can indicate normal/pathological processes, or physiological responses to therapy. Due to the serum abundance in proteins, such as albumin and lypo/glycoproteins, biomarkers are difficult to assess. Serum biomarkers identification can contribute to personalized medicine and improve cancer diagnostic and prognostic. The paper summarizes some of the proteomics techniques and the workflow used for protein signatures identification associated to cancer development. Thus, biomarkers validated for prostatic, breast, cervical or lung cancers are presented as examples for clinical application of serum markers. In spite of the continuous research efforts, there are only few validated biomarkers that have proved a good predictive power in cancer. Modern technology and the combination of various techniques used for proteins quantification represent important means for the identification and validation of new biomarkers.",cancer
"HIV/AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma with multiple skin-mucosal disseminations following ultraviolet (puva) photochemotherapy. HIV/AIDS infection in Bulgaria has spread over about 1200 registered patients and it is supposed that the number of the undetected cases is four times higher. Kaposi's sarcoma is rarely observed in our country and no cutaneous-mucosal dissemination is reported for the time being. AIM: The aim of the study is to present a case of disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma in a HIV/ AIDS patient who underwent Psoralen--UVA radiation treatment (PUVA) for total alopecia. METHODS: HIV was proved through ELISA and Western blot (InnoLia HIV I/II Score). PCR method (COBAS-Amplicor HIV-1 MT, 1,5) was used to determine viral load (VL). Monitoring was realized by flow-cytometric phenotype analysis of the immune cells. Biopsy of a skin lesion was performed for histomorphological analysis. Computed axial tomography (CAT) of the visceral organs was also applied. RESULTS: The patient's face, chest, back and upper extremities are covered by more than 50 typical for Kaposi's sarcoma skin tumors and several isolated lesions are found in the oral cavity mucosa. The histological results show dilated vascular spaces with large endothelial cells and spindle-like tumor cells in irregularly formed fascicles. Monitoring of the immune cells and the viral load before and after the application of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) showed CD4+ T cell number = 0.147 x 10(9)/l and VL = 216 000 copies HIV-RNA/ml plasma when the disorder was first detected. A very good effect appeared 4 months after the HAART start: the mucous membrane lesions disappeared and the skin tumors decreased by number and dimensions. In the same time the CD4+ T cell number increased up to 0.255 x 10(9)/l and VL values decreased < 400 c/ml. CONCLUSION: Disseminated form of Kaposi's sarcoma can be provoked by additional immunosuppressive factors like the implementation of PUVA therapy. Early initiation of HAART improves the process and prevents visceral dissemination.",cancer
"Solitary oral neurofibroma. Neurofibroma is a benign tumor of the peripheral nerve sheath characterized by proliferation of Schwann's cells, perineural cells and endoneurial fibroblasts.

"Pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma of gingivoalveolar sulcus: a case report. BACKGROUND: Leiomyosarcomas are rare tumors in the oral cavity. Oral leiomyosarcomas may arise primarily from bones (maxilla and mandible) or soft tissues. Pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma (PLMS) is a recently described morphologic variant with aggressive clinical behavior and low survival rate; it is exceptionally rare at intraoral sites. CASE: A 21-year-old male presented with a rapidly progressive growth arising from the gingiva. Fine needle aspiration cytology showed pleomorphic polygonal, plasmacytoid and spindled cells. Immunocytochemistry (IC) showed diffuse positivity for vimentin, desmin and cytokeratin, suggestive of high grade sarcoma. The patient underwent surgery, and total extended maxillectomy was performed; the diagnosis was PLMS on histology and IC. Further, detailed clinical and radiologic findings suggested primary high grade soft tissue sarcoma involving the underlying maxillary bone; thus, the final diagnosis was primary PLMS of the gingivoalveolar sulcus. CONCLUSION: Intraoral PLMS arising from gingivoalveolar sulcus in a young patient is an extremely rare lesion with aggressive behavior. Detailed clinicoradiologic findings, its correlation with morphology and IC are mandatory for its final diagnosis and also to exclude metastasis from other sites and primary tumor in bone.",cancer
"Adenoid cystic carcinoma in the uterine cervix: a case report. BACKGROUND: Adenoid cystic carcinoma, a variant of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix, is an extremely rare neoplasm. This report describes a case of primary adenoid cystic carcinoma of the uterine cervix and includes the cytopathologic and histopathologic findings. CASE: A 55-year-old woman presented with postmenopausal bleeding for 2 months. Speculum examination showed a firm mass in the uterine cervix. A Pap smear was obtained, which showed small epithelial cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and coarse chromatin dispersed and adhered around hyaline stromal globular material, along with a few atypical squamous cells. The diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma was confirmed by the histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen as well as the excised specimen, which characteristically revealed the presence of a cribriform pattern of the tumor cells. CONCLUSION: We reported a case of a rare and unusual variant of adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix by considering the characteristic cytologic features of the globules of pale, translucent material surrounded by halos of cells in cribriform adenoid cystic carcinoma.",cancer
"Solitary skeletal lesion as the primary manifestation of Hodgkin's lymphoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) is a malignant neoplasm of lymphoid tissues. Cervical lymphadenopathy is the most common head and neck presentation for HL. Although uncommon, extranodal HL observed at the time of diagnosis is well documented and is typically associated with generalized disease or local spread from adjacent lymph nodes. Primary osseous HL is very rare. CASE: A 23-year-old male presented with a solitary vertebral lesion as primary manifestation of HL. CONCLUSION: HL should be remembered in the differential diagnosis of lytic lesions, especially involving the vertebrae and pelvic bones.",cancer
"Touch preparation of primary uterine pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma: report of a case with clinical cytopathologic features. BACKGROUND: Primary pure uterine rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an extremely rare tumor, and no cytopathologic characteristics of this tumor have been reported before. CASE: We report the clinicopathologic characteristics, including the cytopathologic findings of touch preparations, of a pleomorphic RMS in a postmenopausal woman. CONCLUSION: Touch preparations of tumors are a useful diagnostic procedure for detecting sarcoma in a myomatous tumor, and periodic examination using magnetic resonance imaging is recommended for uterine myomatous tumors even in postmenopausal women.",cancer
"Cytologic findings in malignant ependymoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Intraoperative imprint cytology has proved to be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Ependymomas are uncommon glial neoplasms of the CNS, arising from ependymal lining of the ventricular system and central canal of the spinal cord. Anaplastic ependymoma is a rare tumor that causes diagnostic difficulties in imprint cytology because of variable cytomorphologic findings. CASE: A 21-year-old girl presented with a history of headache and vomiting. Computed tomography of the head showed hydrocephalus with a large parietal lobe tumor with midline structural shift. Imprint intraoperative cytology revealed a hypercellular smear composed of multiple clusters of small size cells with scant amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm with high nucleus to cytoplasm ratios. The tumor showed pseudorosettes with glial fibrillary acidic protein and epithelial membrane antigen expression. The diagnosis was made with histologic and immunologic confirmation. CONCLUSION: Although imprint cytology is a useful method for making a rapid diagnosis, but immunohistochemical markers play a major role in the final diagnosis.",cancer
"Cytodiagnostic aspects of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma manifesting with small cell morphology on respiratory specimens: a case report. BACKGROUND: Exfoliation of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) cells with small cell morphology in respiratory specimens can cause a diagnostic dilemma, particularly in patients with a history of bronchorrhea. CASE: A 59-year-old man presented with cough, breathlessness, and bronchorrhea. Clinically, he was diagnosed to have right-sided pulmonary consolidation. His sputum and bronchial washing specimens examined on multiple occasions revealed a varied number of single and loose aggregates of atypical cells, along with rare micropapillary and glandlike structures. The cells were small, round, and fairly monomorphic with a high nucleus to cytoplasm ratio and scant to moderate cytoplasm. Chromatin was uniformly distributed, with no appreciable nucleoli. At places, a vague nuclear molding was noted. Clinically, bronchorrhea and the diffuse infiltrative nature of the lesion favored BAC. Cytologically, prominent small cell morphology and nuclear molding suggested a possibility of small cell neuroendocrine tumor. However, careful cytologic examination of subsequent respiratory samples and biopsy revealed features of a nonmucinous type of BAC. CONCLUSION: Despite the small cell morphology of neoplastic cells on exfoliative respiratory cytology, a clinical history of bronchorrhea should prompt a cytodiagnosis of BAC. A glandlike arrangement of cells and greater amount of cytoplasm should also assist avoiding misinterpretation in such instances.",cancer
"Malignant fibrous histiocytoma like pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma with laryngeal cancer as a second primary neoplasm: a case report. BACKGROUND: Leiomyosarcoma is one of the most common sarcomas arising in the soft tissue and somatic organs. Pleomorphic leiomyosarcoma (P-LMS) may be easily confused with a malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) as both may share nonspecific morphologic features. It is reported that the larynx is the most common site for a second primary neoplasm (SPN) in a patient with a head and neck malignancy, although an SPN of the larynx following a P-LMS is extremely rare. CASE: A 57-year-old male initially underwent fine needle aspiration (FNA) of a soft tissue tumor (STS) located in the left upper arm. FNA showed the presence of clustered, large tumor cells with clear, eosinophilic and ill-defined cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei. A diagnosis of an undifferentiated malignant tumor was made. Histology showed the presence of MFH. This diagnosis was changed to P-LMS following a lung metastasis. A laryngeal biopsy 37 months after the initial biopsy was performed and showed squamous carcinoma. This squamous carcinoma was presumed to be an SPN. CONCLUSION: This is the first case report of a patient with a P-LMS who then developed laryngeal squamous carcinoma as an SPN.",cancer
"Cytologic detection of recurrence in extramammary Paget's disease of the vulva: a report of two cases. BACKGROUND: Extramammary Paget's disease of the vulva (EMPDV) is a rare gynecologic malignancy. We examined two cases of EMPDV in which cytologic study led to early detection of disease recurrence. CASES: In case 1, a 71-year-old woman, recurrence was detected with malignant cells from the vaginal Papanicolaou smear a few months after radical surgery for endometrial cancer. An asymptomatic perineal erythematous lesion was identified and diagnosed as EMPDV by biopsy specimen. She underwent curative surgery, but during the follow-up period, malignant cells appeared again in her vaginal Papanicolaou smear, which led to early detection of the recurrent disease that was macroscopically invisible. In case 2, an 80-year-old woman presented with the complaint of perineal pruritus and was diagnosed with EMPDV. Twenty-two months after the curative primary surgery, bilateral groin lymphadenopathies appeared, and the cytologic specimen by fine needle aspiration biopsy from the lymph nodes led to early detection of the recurrence without her experiencing negative side effects such as severe pain. CONCLUSION: Cytologic examination is a simple but efficient diagnostic measure without major negative side effects, provided the procedures are applied adequately and performed correctly.",cancer
"Recurrent primary hyperphosphatemic tumoral calcinosis: a case report. BACKGROUND: Tumoral calcinosis (TC) is a special form of idiopathic calcinosis that affects adolescents and young adults. It is characterized by extensive nonosseous calcification, especially in the periarticular soft tissue regions of major joints. CASE: A young girl presented with recurrent subcutaneous swellings over both infrascapular regions and left hip. The patient had elevated serum phosphorus levels while the serum calcium levels were normal. The clinical and radiologic features were suggestive of TC, and the same was confirmed by cytologic and histopathologic study. Positive von-Kossa stain further confirmed that the deposits were of calcium and thus the diagnosis of TC. CONCLUSION: TC is a disorder of obscure etiology with typical clinical, radiologic, cytologic and histopathologic features.",cancer
"Fine needle cytology and flow cytometry of ectopic cervical thymoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: A case of ectopic cervical thymoma (ECT) in which fine needle cytology (FNC) and flow cytometry (FC) have orientated the cytologic diagnosis, is described. CASE: A 57-year-old woman underwent FNC of a right latero-cervical nodule. The smear showed a dispersed lymphoid-cell population; therefore, a second FNC was used for FC and to prepare a cell block. Smears were highly cellular. Cells were medium or large sized, with scanty cytoplasm and nuclei with dispersed chromatin; large cells showed evident nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry on additional smears were positive for CD45RO and Ki67 in most of the cells, and negative for CK pan, CD20, thyreoglobulin and calcitonin. FC showed the following phenotype: CD2/CD3/CD7 = 67%, CD10 = 61%, CD4/CD8 = 62%. CD19 and light chains were not expressed. A diagnosis of T-cell lymphoid proliferation was made and ECT was suggested; histological diagnosis was cervical ectopic benign type B1 thymoma. CONCLUSION: FC may support the FNC diagnosis of ECT because of the specific phenotype of lymphoid cells showing the profile of ""polyclonal"" (CD2/CD3/CD7+) and thymic T-cells (CD10+, CD4/CD6+). FNC and FC may suggest the diagnosis of ECT even in the absence of detectable epithelial cells.",cancer
"Extranodal nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma with dissemination to the central nervous system: a case report. BACKGROUND: Lymphomas that infiltrate the nervous system in children correspond to those of precursor B cells, such as lymphoblastic and Burkitt's lymphoma. In adults, infiltration occurs in mature B-cell lymphomas, such as mantle cell lymphoma, and, rarely, in Hodgkin's lymphoma or peripheral NK/T-cell lymphomas. CASE: We report the case of a 48-year-old man, who two years before death was diagnosed with extranodal nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma nasal in the left nostril. He received radiotherapy and a year later presented tumor activity. He also presented infiltration to the bone marrow and underwent chemotherapy. Afterward, he presented paresthesia and paresis of the lower extremities, difficulty walking, loss of sphincter control, and seizures. Infiltration to the central nervous system was revealed by computed axial tomography, and cytologic study of cerebrospinal fluid revealed malignant lymphoid cells; he then received intrathecal chemotherapy. He died 3 months later. CONCLUSION: In Mexico, extranodal nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma occurs frequently. It is highly destructive and tightly related with the Epstein-Barr virus. Infiltration to the central nervous system is rare, and the neoplastic cells can be confused with other tumors, such as metastatic carcinomas.",cancer
"Cytologic findings of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma of the nasal cavity: a report of 2 cases. BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma metastasizing to the nasal cavity is rare, but nasal bleeding caused by it is difficult to treat. The reason is that a large majority of patients have a bleeding tendency due to liver cirrhosis. Accordingly, early and correct diagnosis is essential. CASES: Case 1, a Japanese man in therapy for C type liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, was diagnosed as metastasis to the bones, and then he was admitted. After hospitalization, he complained of nasal obstruction. Fine needle aspiration biopsy from a tumor occupying nasal and maxillary cavities showed overlapped cells and scattered cells having a round to oval nucleus containing one or a few large nucleoli. The characteristics of cells indicated metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In case 2, a Japanese man under treatment for liver cancer visited our hospital with a complaint of nasal obstruction. In fine needle aspiration biopsy from a mass in the right nasal cavity, cohesive clusters and sparse neoplastic cells similar to those observed in the first case were found. CONCLUSION: Aspiration cytology is useful in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma metastatic to the nasal cavity. Finding characteristic cells is important in the diagnosis. Clinical information is sure to be a convincing clue.",cancer
"Cytohistomorphologic features of malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the breast: a case report. BACKGROUND: Malignant mesenchymal tumors constitute < 1% of all malignant neoplasms of the breast. These include pure primary sarcoma of the breast, metastatic sarcoma and sarcomatous patterns in metaplastic carcinomas. On fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC), the cellular features can suggest the diagnosis of sarcoma of the breast, although the potential exists for confusion with very poorly differentiated carcinoma. CASE: A case of recurrent primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) occurred in the breast in a 32-year-old woman. The patient presented with a fungating mass in the right breast. FNAC was suggestive of malignant mesenchymal tumor, most probably MFH. The diagnosis was confirmed on biopsy. CONCLUSION: Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the breast is a rare entity, and a complete clinicopathologic correlation with immunohistochemical profile is essential to arrive at a correct diagnosis and guide appropriate management of the patient.",cancer
"Cytomorphologic spectrum of mixed pituitary adenoma-gangliocytomas: a report of two cases. BACKGROUND: Mixed pituitary adenoma-gangliocytomas are rare tumors with a broad morphologic spectrum. Smear cytology is a useful tool for recognizing these tumors in an intraoperative setting. CASES: The patients were 45 and 30 years old, and both presented with headache. Intraoperative smears in both cases showed a tumor composed of adenomatous and neuronal elements, in varying proportions. The first case had sheets of monotonous neuroendocrine-type cells with occasional interspersed ganglion cells. The second case, however, had a prominent fibrillary background and was predominantly neurocytic, with a mixture of large ganglion-like cells, intermediate cells, and only rare adenomatous cells. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic features of mixed pituitary adenoma-gangliocytomas can be recognized on intraoperative smear preparations. Smear preparations are often more useful than frozen sections because freezing artifacts may mask one of the two components of the tumor. The proportion of adenomatous and neuronal elements can vary widely from case to case. Careful search for a neuronal component should be made, especially if there is a clinical history of a pituitary adenoma showing incomplete response to hormonal therapy.",cancer
"Cervical large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma with cytologic presentation: a case report. BACKGROUND: Large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) is a rare and aggressive cervical neoplasm. Few cytologic or colposcopic findings of LCNEC have been reported. CASE: A 37-year-old woman, gravida 6, para 4, presented with vaginal bleeding for 3 months. The cervical smears showed cells dispersed as single cells or arranged as loosely cohesive sheets or glandlike aggregate and the nuclear size was almost 3-5 times larger than that of small lymphocytes. The cytologic, pathologic and immunohistochemical examinations suggested LCNEC. The patient underwent a radical hysterectomy and then received radiation and systemic chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Cytologic and colposcopic findings for LCNEC of the uterine cervix are reported. Patients with LCNEC have poor prognoses. Early diagnosis of the tumor is important.",cancer
Chondroid syringoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Chondroid syringoma is a benign skin adnexal tumor. The reported incidence of chondroid syringoma among primary skin tumors is low and has been reported at 0.01-0.098%. CASE: A 57-year-old woman presented with a 10-year history of a slowly growing lump on her philtrum. Fine needle aspiration cytology was performed. The smears showed cohesive groups of round cells embedded in a chondromyxoid ground substance. A diagnosis of benign appendageal tumor of the skin was made. Surgical excision of tumor was done. Histopathologic examination was consistent with chondroid syringoma. CONCLUSION: Chondroid syringoma should be included in the differential diagnosis of a slowly growing nodule on the head or neck. The diagnosis can be confirmed by means of fine needle aspiration cytology. The treatment of choice is local excision.,cancer
"Diagnosis of adult rhabdomyoma by fine needle aspiration cytology: a report of 2 cases. BACKGROUND: Adult rhabdomyoma (ARh) is a rare, benign tumor originating in striated muscle cells. Ninety-three percent of the tumors occur in the head and neck region and sometimes mimic malignant tumors clinically. The preoperative correct diagnosis of this tumor is important as it can help in deciding on management. CASES: We report two cases of ARh diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Case 1 was a 43-year-old male who presented with a recurrent tumor in the region of the floor of the mouth. Case 2 was a 37-year-old male who presented with soft tissue swellings in bilateral submandibular regions. On cytology in both cases, the smears showed numerous large tissue fragments of tumor cells, which were large, polygonal cells with abundant, vacuolated cytoplasm and bland, eccentrically placed nuclei. Characteristic cross-striation and intracytoplasmic inclusions were not conspicuous on cytosmears. However, a primary cytodiagnosis of ARh could be offered based on characteristic morphologic features. CONCLUSION: ARh has characteristic cytomorphologic features, which are described in detail in the present report, and they can help in diagnosing this tumor on FNAC.",cancer
"Epithelioid variant of a pleomorphic liposarcoma displaying arborizing vascular arrangements on cytology smears: a case report of an interesting cytomorphologic pattern in an uncommon tumor. BACKGROUND: There is limited documentation on cytologic features of liposarcomas, especially pleomorphic liposarcomas (PLPSs), in view of their rarity. CASE: We present cytomorphologic features of an uncommon case of epithelioid variant of a PLPS appearing as a recurrent mass in a young adult man. Fine needle aspiration cytology smears displayed prominent arborizing vasculature with numerous lipoblasts with well-defined vacuolated cytoplasm, indenting the nuclei. In addition, mitoses were conspicuously noted. Biopsy from the scar recurrence and following wide excision showed a multinodular tumor with solid arrangement of tumor cells, separated by delicate vessels. Cells displayed well defined cytoplasmic borders, including several lipoblasts and focal areas of spindly sarcomatous differentiation. Typical and atypical mitoses were conspicuously seen and myxoid areas were absent. Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse positivity for vimentin and S-100; cytokeratin showed weak, focal cytoplasmic positivity. CD34 highlighted the delicate vasculature on tissue sections. Diagnosis of an epithelioid variant of a PLPS was finally offered. CONCLUSION: This rare case describes cytomorphologic features of an epithelioid variant of a PLPS, including prominent arborizing vasculature, a pattern that has invariably been described in a myxoid liposarcoma. Additionally, presence of numerous lipoblasts and mitoses led to the diagnosis of this rare variant.",cancer
"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor involving cerebrospinal fluid: a case report. BACKGROUND: Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is a rare, aggressive tumor of the central nervous system. It is primarily seen in younger age-groups, and the cytomorphology has only been infrequently described. CASE: We present a case of AT/RT arising in the cervical spine of a 6-month-old boy. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology and correlating findings are described. The CSF cytomorphologic findings of the AT/RT cells are most notably large cells, eccentrically placed pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli and, commonly, cytoplasmic inclusions, as well as a second population of smaller mononuclear cells with minimal cytoplasm. CONCLUSION: The cervical spine is a rare site for AT/RT to arise. It is important for pathologists to recognize the cytomorphologic features of AT/RT in the CSF of patients with this tumor to help determine prognosis and disease progression.",cancer
"Peripheral pulmonary papillary adenocarcinoma with prominent cilia: report of a rare case that was difficult to diagnose preoperatively. BACKGROUND: In pulmonary cytology, the existence of cilia is considered cytologic evidence of benign cells because it is generally considered that cilia could not be identified by light microscopic observation of pulmonary adenocarcinoma. However, we encountered a rare exceptional case of pulmonary adenocarcinoma with cilia. CASE: A 55-year-old woman with bloody sputum was admitted. Computed tomography revealed a lung tumor. Although transbronchial brushing cytology showed atypical cells suggestive of malignancy, some atypical cells had cilia, so we could not diagnose them as cancer cells. After antibiotic therapy, the tumor was surgically excised. Imprint cytology showed similar atypical ciliated cells. Histologically, the tumor was diagnosed as papillary adenocarcinoma with cilia and diffuse pleural dissemination was observed. Electron microscopic observation identified cilia. The patient died due to aggravation of cancer, which was confirmed on autopsy. CONCLUSION: This rare case of peripheral pulmonary papillary adenocarcinoma with cilia could not be diagnosed as cancer cell on cytology. Pulmonary papillary adenocarcinoma with cilia should be considered in the differential diagnosis of atypical cells in pulmonary cytology.",cancer
"Primary prostatic Wilms' tumor: a case report. BACKGROUND: Extrarenal Wilms' tumors (EWTs) are very rare, and a single case of prostatic EWT has been reported in the English-language literature. CASE: A 46-year-old man presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms was diagnosed with a prostatic tumor histologically proven to be a EWT. CONCLUSION: During the evaluation of a patient with a prostatic tumor, more common prostatic neoplasms such as adenocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma and carcinosarcoma must first be considered. However, the presence of a primary prostatic Wilms' tumor must also be taken into consideration.",cancer
"""Cellular swirls"" and similar structures on fine needle aspiration cytology as diagnostic clues to papillary thyroid carcinoma: a report of 4 cases. BACKGROUND: ""Cellular swirls"" are one of the recently recognized criteria for diagnosing papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Following its initial description, no publications have appeared in the literature. CASE: Thyroid aspirates from 4 adult patients, 3 with a clinical diagnosis of PTC and 1 diagnosed as nodular goiter were studied. Cytologically, all 4 cases showed classic features of PTC. In addition to the characteristic cytomorphology of PTC, all 4 cases showed cellular swirls, which are a newly recognized diagnostic criterion of PTC. Also seen were structures that partially resembled cellular swirls. These latter structures were found to be more prominent in the aspiration smears than the characteristic swirls and, therefore, we strongly think that even the partical swirls with contiguous cellular sheets exhibiting similar nuclear morphology are also useful in prompting a search for ""complete swirls"" that are thought to be specific for PTC. CONCLUSION: Cellular swirls and similar structures seen on fine needle aspiration cytologic smears can serve as useful features in the diagnosis of PTC.",cancer
"Fine needle aspiration of metastatic adult granulosa cell tumor of the ovary: a case report. BACKGROUND: Granulosa cell tumors (GCTs) of the ovary are low grade ovarian malignancies with a predilection for late recurrences in the pelvic cavity and occasionally distant metastases. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) can be used to detect such recurrences accurately based on unique cytologic and immunohistochemical features. CASE: A 5-cm, retrocaval mass at the level of the kidneys was detected in a 63-year-old woman who had a diagnosis of adult GCT (AGCT) of the ovary 18 years earlier and a local recurrence 5 years prior to this admission. The FNA of the retrocaval mass displayed small tumor cells with scant cytoplasm arranged in small aggregates and isolated cells. Coffee bean-like longitudinal nuclear grooves and microfollicular structures with amorphous material resembling Call-Exner bodies were not readily identified. Cytohistologic correlation with the patient's previous biopsies and positive immunohistochemical staining reaction with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and inhibin confirmed the recurrence of AGCT, thus avoiding unnecessary surgical interventions for diagnostic purposes. CONCLUSION: For accurate interpretation of cytologic findings of recurrent GCT, proper clinical history, cytohistologic correlation with prior biopsies and a positive immunohistochemical reaction with inhibin are of vital importance.",cancer
"Cytologic diagnosis of hepatobiliary cystadenoma with mesenchymal stroma during intraoperative consultation: a case report. BACKGROUND: Hepatobiliary cystadenoma with mesenchymal stroma (HCMS) is a rare cystic tumor characterized by a layer of mucinous cuboidal to columnar epithelium situated on top of a basement membrane resting on an ovarian-like stroma. Cytologic features of this entity have not been extensively studied. We present a case of HCMS with emphasis on cytologic material obtained at the time of intraoperative consultation (IOC). CASE: A 51-year-old woman had partial resection of a liver cyst. Seven months later she sought further medical attention and presented for surgical reevaluation and reexcision of the same lesion. Initial computed tomography revealed a multiloculated liver cyst. Five months after reexcision the lesion recurred and was again excised. During IOC, scrape cytology revealed both biliary epithelial and mesenchymal stromal cells in a cystic background. Permanent sections showed histologic features of HCMS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cytologic description of such a neoplasm to include both epithelial and mesenchymal stromal elements. CONCLUSION: The use of scrape cytology during IOC can be a fast and effective way of identifying both the epithelium and mesenchymal stroma when HCMS is in the differential diagnosis of a cystic liver lesion.",cancer
"Pancreatic solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm: report of a case in an elderly man with cytologic-histologic correlation. BACKGROUND: Solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms of the pancreas are rare and unusual tumors, occurring mostly in young women. Their cytologicfeatures are well described in textbooks; however, published reports still show some cytologic findings overlapping with pancreatic endocrine neoplasms and demonstrate the important diagnostic role of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. CASE: A case of solid-pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas occurred in a 61-year-old man; on cytology it was initially diagnosed as pancreatic endo crine neoplasm. The resection specimen in addition to immunohistochemical stains gave away the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration remains a valid, minimally invasive procedure in pancreatic cytology. Tumor cells grouped around fibrovascular cores are the most reproducible cytologic finding in these tumors. Immunostains can play an important role when cell block material is available.",cancer
"Unique cytomorphologic features of Brenner tumor of the ovary: a case report. BACKGROUND: Breast carcinomas are very well known to metastasize to the ovary. Hence, it is justified to think of an ovarian mass, in a known case of breast carcinoma, as a metastasis from the same. CASE: A 70-year-old woman underwent ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from a unilateral ovarian mass to confirm its nature. Cytosmears were highly cellular and showed cohesive clusters of small to intermediate-sized cells with bland nuclear chromatin and moderate cytoplasm in a background of mucinous material. A unique feature was the presence of microcystic spaces, around which the cells were arranged in an orderly fashion. Only occasional nuclear grooves were seen; however, they were helpful in suggesting the diagnosis of Brenner tumor. The subsequent histopathology specimen confirmed the diagnosis, with an excellent cytohistologic correlation. CONCLUSION: There is very limited experience with the FNAC findings of this tumor, and it is usually a diagnostic dilemma for the cytopathologist. This case highlights certain unique cytomorphologic features that may aid in diagnosis on cytology alone.",cancer
"Medullary thyroid carcinoma, small cell variant, as a diagnostic challenge on fine needle aspiration: a case report. BACKGROUND: The small cell variant of medullary thyroid carcinoma (SCV-MTC) is a very unusual tumor that carries a poor prognosis. This tumor type closely resembles small cell pulmonary neuroendocrine carcinoma or lymphoma. CASE: A 43-year-old woman had a palpable mass on the right side of her neck. A fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) revealed a hypercellular lesion composed mainly of isolated, small, round cells with salt-and-pepper chromatin interspersed with inconspicuous deposits of fluffy acellular material. A diagnosis of ""malignant tumor, consistent with small cell carcinoma, metastasis not excluded"" was rendered during the on-site rapid cytologic examination. Immunostaining showed a few isolated cells reactive for calcitonin, intense and diffuse immunoreactivity for carcinoembryonic antigen, dotlike positivity for chromogranin and cytokeratin, and negativity for thyroglobulin. Congo-red staining was positive in the acellular deposit, consistent with SCV-MTC. Subsequent total thyroidectomy confirmed this diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The wide range of cytomorphologic features of MTC can be misleading on FNAB and can be a diagnostic challenge. Congo-red staining and immunoreactivity for calcitonin can be negative in this variant. Consequently, salt-and-pepper chromatin, Congo-red staining and a panel of antibodies comprising calcitonin, carcinoembryonic antigen, chromogranin, cytokeratin, leukocyte common antigen and thyroglobulin are mandatory for the correct diagnosis.",cancer
"Diagnosis of hidradenoma papilliferum of the vulva on cytologic smears: a case report. BACKGROUND: Hidradenoma papilliferum is a rare benign tumor of the vulva that occurs mainly in women in the skin of the anogenital region. Clinically it may mimic a carcinoma, so the correct cytologic interpretation of the tumor cells with subsequent careful histologic confirmation is essential for good management. CASE: A 44-year-old woman who had a history of hysterectomy 14 years earlier presented with a small, exophytic growth on the labia majora. Fine needle aspiration cytology and vulvar scraping of the lesion were reported as a malignant tumor, and the case was referred to our center for further management. Repeat vulvar smears showed mainly groups and clusters of benign-looking glandular cells and were interpreted as a benign tumor. Subsequent histology confirmed the diagnosis of hidradenoma papilliferum. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the cytologic features of hidradenoma papilliferum on cytologic smears. The clinical presentation should not mislead the cytologic interpretation of the tumor cells.",cancer
"Gaucher-like cells in retroperitoneal extramedullary hematopoietic tumor diagnosed by fine needle aspiration: a case report. BACKGROUND: Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) can present as a diffuse lesion or as a solitary mass. EMH is most commonly seen in patients with hematologic disorders and rarely in asymptomatic patients. The liver, spleen and lymph nodes are the most common EMH sites. However, EMH has also been seen at unusual sites, including adrenal glands, breast, thymus, thyroid, kidney, epididymis, lung, pleura, peripheral nerves and dura mater. The diagnosis of this lesion on fine needle aspiration (FNA) smears has rarely been described. CASE: A 20-year-old man with Cooley's anemia presented with a retroperitoneal tumor for the past 3 months that was clinically diagnosed as malignant. Ultrasonographically guided FNA cytology showed bone marrow cells composed of myelocytes, lymphocytes, erythroblasts and megakaryocytes, which were consistent with an extramedullary hematopoietic tumor. Histologic sections of the excised tumor confirmed the FNA diagnosis. Interestingly, Gaucher-like cells were frequently seen in the smears. CONCLUSION: The FNA findings of EMH can be confused with those of inflammatory pseudotumor, Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders and granulocytic sarcoma. Clinical history can be helpful for interpreting FNA findings in an EMH diagnosis.",cancer
"Paget's disease of the vulva detected in vulvar and vaginal brushing smears: a case report. BACKGROUND; Vulvar Paget's disease comprises only 1-8% of malignant vulvar tumors. It is associated with an underlying carcinoma in 20-30% of cases. Clinically, it manifests as erythematous areas with hyperkeratotic plaques, accompanied by pruritus. Histologically, it is characterized by large, pale cells with mucicarmine-positive cytoplasm, isolated or in aggregates, in the epidermis. CASE: A 75-year-old woman presented with erythematous plaques covering the entire vulvar, vaginal and perianal area and pruritus. Smears were taken from all 3 sites and stained with Papanicolaou stain. Additionally, biopsies were taken from the vulva, vagina and outer borders of the lesion and were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and also for periodic acid-Schiff stain, CK7, CEA, S-100 and CK20. The cytologic examination revealed numerous round to columnar, moderately enlarged atypical cells, dispersed or in loose groups, with abundant clear cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. The histologic findings confirmed the cytologic diagnosis. No indication of an underlying adenocarcinoma was found. CONCLUSION: Although the histologic examination of a vulvar lesion is necessary in order to confirm the diagnosis of vulvar Paget's disease and rule out the possibility of an underlying invasive adenocarcinoma, the cytologic examination of vulvar smears is useful for alerting the clinician to the possibility of vulvar Paget's disease.",cancer
"Utility of cell block preparation in endometrial aspiration cytology: a report of 4 cases. BACKGROUND: Endometrial aspiration (EA) cytology is a simple yet highly useful diagnostic procedure for uterine and extrauterine malignancies. CASES: Two postmenopausal women underwent EA following ultrasonographic findings of unilateral hydrosalpinx and fluid in the endometrial cavity. A few atypical glandular clusters were detected on cytologic smears. Sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cell block preparations revealed fragments of uterine papillary serous carcinoma showing strong positivity of tumor cell nuclei to p53 on immunohistochemistry (IHC). A 78-year-old woman suffering from intestinal Crohn's disease was found to have a cystic lesion of the right adnexa and fluid level in the endometrial cavity on ultrasonography. Acellular, ringlike structures were noted on cytologic smears of the EA. Sections from the FFPE cell block demonstrated the structures to be periodic acid-Schiff-positive Liesegang rings. A 43-year-old woman underwent diagnostic hysteroscopy and EA for prolonged, excessive vaginal discharge. Cytologic features of endometrial cellular clusters were obscured by a dirty background and macrophages. Sections from the FFPE cell block showed normal proliferative endometrium with CD10-positive endometrial stroma, thus ruling out malignancy. CONCLUSION: Conclusion FFPE cell block preparation is a valuable adjunctive tool for EA in the evaluation of endometrial lesions, ensuring excellent quality of preparations for special stains and IHC.",cancer
"Metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma mimicking acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid gland: a case report. BACKGROUND: Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is becoming increasingly important in the diagnosis of salivary gland lesions. One of the diagnostic difficulties that arise from FNAs is the distinction between primary and metastatic tumors. We describe a case where a right cheek/parotid mass was originally diagnosed as acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) upon biopsy. Later, an FNA resampling of the mass was diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and indeed, a subsequently performed computed tomography scan showed that the patient had a previously unknown liver mass. CASE: A 75-year-old man presented with a pathologic mandibular fracture. An initial needle core biopsy of the lesion showed neoplastic cells with abundant granular cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli and was diagnosed as ACC. The patient shortly thereafter developed an abdominal lesion that upon FNA was found to be cytologically similar to the parotid mass. Immunohistochemical stains showed that the abdominal mass was Hep Par 1 positive, and HCC was diagnosed. An FNA resampling of the parotid lesion was then performed, and stains showed that it was also Hep Par 1 positive. The lesion was rediagnosed as metastatic HCC and not ACC. Radiologic scans of the patient then showed a liver mass as well as multiple bony lesions. CONCLUSION: A right cheek/parotid mass initially diagnosed as ACC was later found to be metastatic HCC. At times, the judicious use of immunohistochemical stains is necessary to distinguish primary salivary gland neoplasias from metastatic tumors.",cancer
"Fine needle aspiration cytology of a cutaneous metastasis from an extraadrenal paraganglioma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Pheochromocytomas/paragangliomas are rare tumors originating from neuroectodermic cells, which metastasize in only 10% of cases. CASE: A case of cutaneous metastasis of an extramedullary paraganglioma was diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). A 39-year-old woman complained of a recently arisen subcutaneous nodule located on the scalp. Two years before she had suffered from a sporadic extraadrenal paraganglioma located on the sacrum, and it had been evaluated by FNAC. Smears were highly cellular and monomorphous; the cells were uniform and mainly isolated with round or ovoid nuclei, dense chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli, if any. The cytoplasm was ill defined, clear or granular. Oval-spindle-shaped cells and occasional cells with larger nuclei were also observed. Abundant fibrillar material was present in the background, intermingled with the surrounding cells. The immunocytochemical staining performed on cell block sections showed negativity for CK20, HMB45 and LCA and positivity for chromogranin and S100. The cytologic diagnosis was a neuroendocrine tumor, consistent with a metastasis from the former sacral paraganglioma. CONCLUSION: On conventional samples the cytologic features of paraganglioma are typical enough to allow a cytologic diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor; this neoplasm should be considered in the differential diagnosis, even in such unusual locations, because of its unpredictable biologic behavior.",cancer
"Extraovarian peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Extraovarian peritoneal serous papillary carcinoma (EPSPC) is a rare cancer closely related to ovarian carcinoma and characterized by abdominal carcinomatosis without an identifiable abdominal primary tumor. CASE: A woman presented with ascites. She had an elevated serum CA-125. Peritoneal carcinomatosis without involvement of the ovaries was found. Paracentesis of the ascitic fluid resulted in a positive cytologic report not further suggestive of the malignancy origin, balancing between a mesothelioma and an adenocarcinoma. The histologic and immunohistochemical study of peritoneal biopsy specimens resulted in the diagnosis of EPSPC. CONCLUSION: The combination of cytology, histology, immunohistochemistry and clinical data is a reliable method for the preoperative diagnosis of EPSPC, allowing prompt chemotherapy as surgery may not be indicated in most cases.",cancer
"Cytomorphology of hibernoma: a report of 2 cases. BACKGROUND: Hibernoma, a benign neoplasm of the brown fat, clinically and radiologically can mimic a lipoma or liposarcoma, especially in the retroperitoneum. As treatment modalities vary, an accurate preoperative diagnosis may help the surgeon to plan treatment. Hence cytologic features of 2 cases of hibernoma are described. CASES: Two middle-aged men diagnosed clinically as having lipomas were subjected to fine needle aspiration (FNA). Smears revealed typical hibernoma cells with a minor percentage of eosinophilic cells and mature adipocytes. CONCLUSION: FNA is a highly sensitive and specific tool for the diagnosis of hibernoma.",cancer
"Cerebrospinal fluid cytologic findings of a pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) is a rare astrocytic neoplasm with a relatively favorable prognosis. Characteristic histologic features include pleomorphic tumor cells and lipidized cells expressing glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), corresponding to a World Health Organization grade 2 tumor. Cytologic features of PXA have been rarely described, only in squash specimens, but only 2 cases are reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CASE: A 45-year-old woman complained of severe headaches and diplopia. Computed tomography of the central nervous system revealed a supracallous periventricular tumor mass suggestive of either a lymphoma or a metastatic carcinoma. CSF revealed 18 cells/mm3 and contained numerous tumor cells highly pleomorphic in size and shape. Some atypical cells of moderate size were closely packed with well-defined cytoplasmic limits and a vacuolated appearance, suggesting an epithelial proliferation. On immunocytochemistry atypical cells were positive for GFAP, S100 protein and synaptophysin but were negative for pancytokeratins and epithelial membrane antigen. A primitive glial proliferation was found, and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue obtained by biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of anaplastic PXA. CONCLUSION: Observation of PXA in CSF might cause some differential diagnosis problems, especially with a metastatic epithelial malignancy. We present a case of anaplastic PXA with an unusual periventricular location and its cytologic features in CSF.",cancer
"Imprint cytology in diagnosing-primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast during intraoperative frozen consultation: a case report. BACKGROUND; Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the breast is uncommon among primary malignant breast tumors. Here we present a case diagnosed as primary breast lymphoma with imprint cytology during intraoperative frozen consultation. CASE: A 67-year-old woman presented with a palpable, non-tender mass in her left breast that she had had for 2 weeks. The mammogram and ultrasound studies revealed 1 lobular mass in the left breast without axillary lymphadenopathy. Imprint cytology helped diagnose malignant lymphoma of the breast, preventing radical surgery. CONCLUSION: Frozen artifact may obscure the evaluation of cytomorphology during intraoperative consultation. Imprint cytology may help due to less artifact with the cytologic details. Primary breast lymphomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of breast tumors. The current literature recommendation of intermediate to high grade lymphoma is combined partial mastectomy followed by chemotherapy with local radiotherapy.",cancer
"Primary schwannoma of the thyroid gland: a case report. BACKGROUND: Primary schwannomas of the thyroid gland are extremely rare. These tumors most often present as asymptomatic solitary neck masses, slow growing and rarely malignant. Only 15 cases of intrathyroidal schwannoma have been reported in the literature, and few have been reported with fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology. CASE: A 14-year-old male patient presented with an asymptomatic left intrathyroidal mass. Radiologic studies revealed a circumscribed, marked hypoechoic mass with cystic portions in the left lobe of the thyroid gland on ultrasonography, pushing the trachea toward the right, visible side on computed tomography. FNA cytology of the mass exhibited a paucicellular smear composed of predominantly round to oval-shaped cells and occasional ovoid to spindle-shaped cells in loosely cohesive aggregates. On pathologic examination, the mass measured 60 x 45 x 30 mm and consisted of spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicles in a whorling pattern in association with alternating hypercellular and hypocellular areas. CONCLUSION: Awareness of and understanding of the cytopathologic and radiologic characteristics of this entity are helpful in preoperative evaluation and correct treatment of intrathyroidal schwannoma.",cancer
"Solid variant of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in the head and neck region: a case report of a diagnostic dilemma in a head and neck fine needle aspiration clinic. BACKGROUND: Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is one of the major categories of rhabdomyosarcomas; it encompasses malignant tumors of striated muscle and occurs more frequently in the extremities. It is uncommonly reported in young adults and extremely rarely found in middle-aged and elderly patients. CASE: A 54-year-old man presented to a rapid head and neck clinic with a history of rapid enlargement of neck lumps on the right side of his neck over a period of 5 weeks. The diagnosis of an undifferentiated malignant small round cell tumor was made from cytologic examination of the aspirated sample, and biopsy of the lesion was advised. On histologic analysis, diagnosis of solid variant of ARMS was made. CONCLUSION: A solid variant of ARMS in an older population has not been published in the literature within the settings of a rapid head and neck clinic. Therefore, the remote possibility of this diagnosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a malignant, round cell tumor in fine needle aspiration cytology in an older patient's neck lump.",cancer
"Neoplastic ascites in osteosarcoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor of connective tissue whose tumor cells produce bone tissue. It can be classified as osteoblastic, chondroblastic, or fibroblastic, according to the predominant histologic type of cells. Its dissemination is hematogenous, and the lungs are the most frequent site of clinically evident metastasis. Extrapulmonary metastases are rare and more frequently diagnosed at necropsy. We present a case of osteosarcoma with peritoneal dissemination that developed neoplastic ascites. CASE: A 46-year-old patient came to the hospital with a 4-month history of lumbar pain and weakness in the lower limbs. Computed tomography showed blastic lesions in the L3 vertebral body. Surgical resection and histologic analysis revealed a mixed osteoblastic and chondroblastic osteosarcoma. After only one session of chemotherapy, the patient presented a marked clinical worsening with extensive metastatic dissemination and occurrence of voluminous ascites. The cytologic examination of the ascitic fluid demonstrated frequent poorly differentiated tumor cells. The patient died a little more than 2 months after the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: This case is the only report of osteosarcoma primarily focused on the vertebral column affected by peritoneal metastasis shown by cytologic examination of ascitic fluid.",cancer
"Potential misdiagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma with Hodgkin's lymphoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is an aggressive neoplasm. We investigated the potential utility of touch imprints evaluated in conjunction with the histology of lymph nodes in the diagnosis of AITL. CASE A 58-year-old man presented with generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and autoimmune phenomena, which complicated the diagnosis. Touch imprints were obtained from the lymph node biopsy, which were valuable in making the correct diagnosis. The cytologic and microscopic features of these imprints and lymph node samples showed a heterogeneous population of hematolymphoid cells, including small to intermediate lymphoid cells, immunoblasts, plasma cells, dendritic cells, and eosinophils, as well as small vessels that were surrounded by some of the abnormal cells. Neoplastic cells stained positive for CD3, CD4, and CD5. Isolated immunoblasts stained with CD20 and CD30. CONCLUSION: We draw attention to this neoplastic diagnosis and correlate the cytomorphologic and immunohistochemical findings with the adequate clinical setting in order to avoid misdiagnosis, primarily with Hodgkin's lymphoma and reactive hyperplasia. Touch imprints are useful in the diagnosis of AITL if the broad population of proliferating cells is distinguished. However, some cases display binucleated or mononucleated cells with prominent nucleoli and many eosinophils, which may induce a potential misdiagnosis with Hodgkin's lymphoma.",cancer
Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma in the hard palate: a case report. BACKGROUND: Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma (EMC) is an uncommon salivary gland tumor. CASE: EMC arising from the minor salivary gland of the hard palate is very rare. A 70-year-old man presented with a nodular swelling in the hard palate. Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed biphasic epithelial (small cell) and myoepithelial (large/clear cell) clusters in a pseudopapillary and trabecular pattern. The cytology was reported as salivary gland neoplasm. The mass was excised and the histomorphology was suggestive of a low grade EMC. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the biphasic nature of the tumor and confirmed the diagnosis of EMC. Follow-up for 2 years post surgery to date did not show any recurrence or metastases. CONCLUSION: Though exact cytologic typing of EMC was not possible; this case highlights the importance of awareness of this tumor in the differential diagnosis of biphasic tumors of the salivary gland.,cancer
"Lipid-rich variant of pancreatic endocrine neoplasms: a case report. BACKGROUND: Pancreatic endocrine neoplasms (PENs) are a well-defined and well-characterized group of tumors. We report a rare variant of PENs called a lipid-rich variant and elaborate on its cytologic features with reference to fine needle aspiration (FNA). CASE: The patient was a 74-year-old man with a 2.1-cm mass in the body of the pancreas. The FNA showed numerous cells with vacuolated, foamy cytoplasm, mostly arranged individually but also in some apparently cohesive clusters. The nuclei were quite uniform. Many of the cells had the appearance of histiocytes. The cells in the cell block were immunoreactive (positive) for cytokeratin AE1/AE3, synaptophysin, and chromogranin A. Some admixed histiocytes stained for CD68. A diagnosis of PEN was made, with a suspicion for lipid-rich variant. An elective resection of the tumor was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis of lipid-rich variant of PENs. Lipid-rich variant of PENs can present a diagnostic dilemma on FNA. CONCLUSION: Its mimickers include adrenal cortical carcinoma, metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma, clear-cell PEN, foamy gland pattern of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, solid pseudopapillary tumor, and acinar cell carcinoma. The distinguishing morphologic and immunohistochemical features of each are described.",cancer
"Primary extranotochordal cervical chordoma masquerading as a thyroid neoplasm: a case report. BACKGROUND: Chordoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of notochord origin that occurs along the craniospinal axis, and extranotochordal chordoma is extremely unusual. An aberrant origin of this neoplasm can pose diagnostic pitfalls. We report a case of primary cervical chordoma of extranotochordal origin clinically presenting as a thyroid neoplasm. The cytomorphologic features of chordoma and its cytologic differential diagnoses are discussed. CASE: An 82-year-old man presented with hoarseness of voice and difficulty in swallowing. He had a mass in the anterolateral aspect of the right side of the neck. Magnetic resonance imaging of the neck with contrast study revealed an ill-defined, contrast-enhancing tumor mass located in the right retrolaryngeal and parapharyngeal space at the level of C4, invading the perithyroidal soft tissue. Aspiration biopsy cytology of the tumor demonstrated epithelial-like cells with varied cytomorphologic features causing differential diagnostic problems with thyroid and soft tissue. However, the diagnosis of extranotochordal chordoma was established by the subsequent histologic examination of the excisional biopsy specimen. CONCLUSION: Since chordoma is capable of exhibiting a spectrum of cytomorphologic characteristics and can have cytologic features overlapping with other malignant neoplasms, a high index of suspicion is crucial to make an accurate diagnosis on fine needle aspiration biopsy. This case highlights the occurrence of a rare neoplasm at an aberrant site and the diagnostic challenges that can pose. However, awareness of the abnormal locations and characteristic cytomorphologic features of chordoma together with radiologic findings will usually keep the cytopathologist from making a wrong diagnosis.",cancer
"Diagnosis of carcinosarcoma metastatic to the umbilicus by fine needle aspiration biopsy: a case report. BACKGROUND: Metastasis to the umbilicus, known as Sister Mary Joseph's nodule, sometimes represents the first clinical manifestation of an internal malignancy. These nodules are infrequent, and their discovery has prognostic implications. CASE: An 86-year-old woman presented with an ultrasound diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis and the presence of a round lesion in the umbilical area. A fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed. The cytologic smears showed a biphasic neoplasm composed of malignant epithelial cells with a glandular appearance and randomly scattered spindle cells in a necrotic base. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to confirm the diagnosis. CONCLUSION: After an extensive search of the literature, we discovered that this is the first report of a metastatic carcinosarcoma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy. The diagnosis of carcinosarcoma requires a clear definition of the 2 components, which is why immunohistochemical staining is very useful. The presence of an umbilical nodule should raise suspicion of an underlying malignant neoplasm. Needle aspiration biopsy should be considered as the most effective, simple, uncomplicated method of diagnosing these lesions.",cancer
"Fine needle aspiration cytology of metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the left breast in a woman with a known right breast primary: a case report. BACKGROUND: Metastatic tumors in the breast from extramammary primary malignancies are uncommon, and the kidney has been the site of a primary in very rare cases. CASE: Fine needle aspiration cytology and immunohistochemical findings in a 70-year-old woman are described in whom a left-sided breast mass from a metastatic clear cell (conventional) carcinoma of the kidney was diagnosed due to unusual cellular findings. A few years earlier, the patient had a right-sided primary breast carcinoma for which a lumpectomy with clear margins had been done. Also, since on comparison the cell pattern of the breast primary did not match the morphology of the clear cell tumor on the left side, further immunohistochemical staining was undertaken on sections of cell blocks and smears from the aspirate and confirmed positivity for oil-red-O, CD10, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) marker and AE1/AE3 and negativity for ER, PR, CK7, HER2/neu and mucus, which favored the diagnosis of RCC. Furthermore, the ER, PR, CK7, HER2/neu were positive in sections of the primary breast carcinoma, while the staining for CD10, RCC marker and AE1/AE3 were negative. On further inquiry following cytodiagnosis, it was found that a few years earlier the patient had had a left nephrectomy for a clear cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The findings emphasize a cautious approach in interpreting cytologic findings in aspirates with unusual cell features that do not resemble those of a primary breast carcinoma and warrant further workup using selective immunohistochemical stains, which can be useful in resolving the diagnostic dilemma of distinguishing a primary from a metastatic carcinoma.",cancer
"Cutaneous needle track seeding of mesothelioma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology: a case report. BACKGROUND: Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for mesothelioma require surgical biopsy or the usage of different-sized needles. Thoracic wall involvement along the surgical or needle tracks has been reported. CASE: A 57-year-old woman who had suffered from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma complained of dyspnea and left pleural effusion. The patient had been treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy and was in remission since then. Thoracentesis was performed using a 22-gauge needle; the cytologic diagnosis was malignant pleural mesothelioma. Within 2 weeks from thoracentesis, the patient complained of an erythematous swelling in her left chest wall, in the area of the needle track. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the swelling was performed using a 23-gauge needle; 2 smears and a cell block were prepared. Smears showed neoplastic cells in sheets and papillary configuration with the features of mesothelial lineage. Immunocytochemistry showed positivity for calretinin and vimentin. Cytologic slides of the former effusion showed an overlapping of the cytologic and immunocytochemical features. A diagnosis of chest wall involvement from mesothelioma was established and histologically confirmed. CONCLUSION: Chest wall infiltration is a definite risk in the management of pleural mesothelioma, and FNAC is a useful procedure for a timely diagnosis of this ominous complication.",cancer
"Infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma: report of a case with fine needle aspiration findings. BACKGROUND: Infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma is a rare tumor. Cytologic and histologic differentiation from other hepatic tumors is necessary to determine appropriate therapy. Fine needle aspiration cytology of this rare tumor has not been reported in the literature before. CASE: A 5-month-old female infant presented with hepatomegaly. Computed tomography revealed numerous nodules occupying the entire liver parenchyma that were considered to be metastatic tumors. However, the primary tumor was not detected. Cytology smears revealed numerous clusters of and isolated, benign-looking, cuboidal, round cells that were diagnosed as benign tumors, and a laparotomy was advised. Histology of the nodules showed infantile hepatic hemangioendothelioma. The patient is alive and undergoing supportive therapy. CONCLUSION: A vascular lesion should be considered in a fine needle aspiration biopsy of liver masses in infants, especially when the clinical features are not consistent with a metastatic malignancy. Immunoreactivity for factor VII-related antigen, CD34 and cytokeratin-7 is helpful in establishing the diagnosis.",cancer
"Invasive micropapillary carcinoma of the colon in ascitic fluid: a case report. BACKGROUND: Invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) is defined as having characteristic pathologic features of small papillary cell clusters surrounded by lacunar spaces and is known as an aggressive variant in advanced stages due to the high incidence of lymph node metastasis. IMPC has been well described in other organs, including the breast, urinary bladder and lung but has been rarely described in the large intestine. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the cytology of colorectal lesion of IMPC in the English-language literature. CASE: A 64-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain, nausea and constipation. Ascitic fluid cytology showed adenocarcinoma with papillary features, and a colectomy specimen showed IMPC. The cytologic features of this case were characterized by small papillary clusters with a smooth surface showing peripherally located cytoplasm with a rare central lumen, as ""inside-out"" cell clusters; these findings suggested IMPC. Differentiation from adenocarcinoma of other organs may be difficult, but immunohistochemical profiles suggested a colorectal origin; it was positive for CK20 and negative for CK7. CONCLUSION: IMPC has a distinctive cytomorphologic appearance, and this entity can be suggested from ascitic fluid cytology.",cancer
"Fine needle aspiration biopsy for the diagnosis of thymoma metastatic to the breast: a case report. BACKGROUND: Extrathoracic metastases of thymomas are extremely rare, with only 9 documented cases in the cytologic literature, and a thymoma metastasis to the breast has not been reported before. Here we report the cytologic findings on fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) for the diagnosis of a case of thymoma metastatic to the breast. CASE: A 73-year-old woman presented with a palpable mass in the right breast. A sonogram revealed a discrete, hypoechoic nodule in the upper inner quadrant of the breast. She had a history of mediastinal thymoma 2 years earlier, which was treated with chemotherapy because of inoperability. FNAB was performed: the cytologic specimen showed epithelial cell clusters with a few entrapped lymphocytes, suggestive of metastatic thymoma. However, the differential diagnosis also included a primary malignancy such as poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma or medullary carcinoma of the breast. Excisional biopsy with additional immunohistochemical staining confirmed the thymoma metastasis. CONCLUSION: An FNAB-based diagnosis of this rare entity can be an appropriate, simple and minimally invasive procedure in the right clinical setting and with the appropriate patient history.",cancer
"Well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma in association with endometrial carcinoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Well-differentiated papillary mesothelioma (WDPM) is an uncommon tumor usually arising in the peritoneum and mostly an incidental finding during abdominal and pelvic surgery. Its natural history and association with other neoplasms is not clearly understood. We present a rare case of WDPM in association with high-grade endometrial carcinoma. To our knowledge, there are only two previously reported cases in the English literature of WDPM in association with endometrial carcinoma. CASE: A 62-year-old woman underwent pelvic surgery for a high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma. At laparotomy an extensive peritoneal nodular fibrotic reaction was present, raising the clinical possibility of metastatic disease; however, intraoperative frozen section reported this as a mesothelial reaction. Cytologic examination of peritoneal washings revealed cohesive clusters of reactive-appearing mesothelial cells, some with papillary morphology, and no evidence of adenocarcinoma. The peritoneal biopsies showed no metastatic carcinoma. The endometrial tumor was an endometrioid adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: The cytologic diagnosis of WDPM may be difficult because it is an uncommon entity and there are overlapping features with other neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions of the female genital tract and peritoneum. Compounding this, WDPM may occur in association with other neoplasms. We highlight the potential for surgical and pathologic misinterpretation of this entity.",cancer
"Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma involving mainly the uterus: report of a case using liquid-based cytology of the endometrium. BACKGROUND: Intravascular lymphoma is a rare subtype of extranodal lymphoma. Most instances of the disease are of B-cell lineage. Diagnosis is difficult because of its nonspecific clinical signs, and many cases are diagnosed at autopsy. Uterine involvement is rare, and it is commonly manifested as genital bleeding. In this case, the chief complaint was fever, which is also very rare. CASE REPORT: A 62-year-old woman presented with fever of unknown origin. Computed tomography revealed no localized lesion except for swelling of the right internal iliac nodes. A cytologic smear of the endometrium by liquid-based cytology demonstrated malignant cells. Based on the curettage material, the lesion was diagnosed as an undifferentiated malignant tumor. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic/paraaortic lymphadenectomy revealed widely scattered lymphoma cells of B-cell lineage mainly in the vascular lumina of the uterus, right ovary and lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: The final histologic type was established on the basis of the surgical material of hysterectomy. Diagnosis was difficult because of prominent cellular atypia and rare location of the tumor. Immunocytochemical examination of liquid-based samples can lead to a correct diagnosis of malignant lymphoma, even at the stage of endometrial cytologic examination.",cancer
"Spleen metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma: report of a case with diagnosis by fine needle aspiration cytology. BACKGROUND: Metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to various organs is frequently seen. The lungs, regional lymph nodes, kidney, bone marrow and adrenals are relatively common sites of metastasis. Spleen metastasis from HCC is unusual, and only a few cases have been retorted; none have been diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). CASE: A 54-year-old male visited our institute with chief complaints of abdominal pain and mild ascites. Multifocal HCC and an isolated splenic mass lesion were detected on abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography. FNAC was performed under ultrasound guidance from the liver and spleen mass lesions. Cytologic examination of the aspirates showed classical features of hepatocellular carcinoma and similar tumor cells with hepatocytic differentiation in the spleen. Immunocytochemistry for hepatocyte paraffin-1 confirmed the splenic metastasis of HCC. CONCLUSION: Splenic metastasis from HCC diagnosed by FNAC is an exceptional situation; herein we confirm the rarity of this pathology and the efficacy of FNAC as a safe and valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating splenic lesions in oncologic patients.",cancer
"Unilateral pleural effusion as a presenting manifestation of plasma cell myeloma (multiple myeloma): a case report. BACKGROUND: Malignant pleural effusion caused by multiple myeloma (MM) is rare, occurring as a late complication with a poor prognosis. Myelomatous pleural effusion (MPE) as an initial manifestation of the disease is extremely uncommon. CASE: A 54-year-old, previously healthy man presented with right-sided pleural effusion. Cytologic examination of the aspirated fluid revealed large, slightly pleomorphic atypical cells, some having eccentric nuclei. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) performed on cytospin smears and cell block sections gave a positive reaction for CD138, EMA and vimentin and a negative reaction for CK7, CK20, calretinin, S-100 and E-cadherin. CONCLUSION: Cytopathologists may be caught unawares by atypical presentations of hematologic malignancies. The diagnosis of MPE requires a high level of suspicion, and routine incorporation of ICC in the cytologic evaluation will ensure accurate diagnosis and proper patient management.",cancer
"Fine needle aspiration of parapharyngeal space adult rhabdomyoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyomas are rare benign tumors of striated muscle and include cardiac and extracardiac types. Extracardiac rhabdomyomas are divided in three subtypes (adult, fetal, genital). The adult type is usually found in the head and neck regions of elderly persons. Misinterpretations in initial diagnosis of adult rhabdomyomas on fine needle aspiration have been reported. CASE: A 64-year-old man presented with gurgling and difficulty swallowing for approximately 3 months. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a 5.8-cm solid mass located in the right parapharyngeal space. Fine needle aspiration smears were cellular, showing cohesive clusters of cells with scattered individual cells. Cells had abundant eosinophilic glassy cytoplasm, peripherally placed round nuclei, and prominent nucleoli. Many traversing vessels were noted, but cross-striations were not seen. The cell block demonstrated clusters of cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm, some with clear and/or vacuolated cytoplasm, and possible cross-striations. Tumor cells were positive for desmin. The lesion closely resembled normal muscle tissue. Electron microscopy showed many cells containing actin and myosin filaments with Z-band material. CONCLUSION: Correct diagnosis can be achieved with a combination of awareness of the lesion, familiarity with the characteristic cytologic features, and application of appropriate immunohistochemistry markers. Classic electron microscopic findings can support the diagnosis.",cancer
"Primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lung: a report of 2 cases. BACKGROUND: Signet-ring cell carcinoma is a distinct subtype of mucin-producing adenocarcinoma that originates in various organs, particularly the stomach. However, primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lung is an extremely rare condition. The preoperative identification of signet-ring cells by cytologic examination is vital because signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lung has been reported to have a worse prognosis than ordinary adenocarcinoma. In this study, we present 2 cases of primary signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lung in conjunction with their cytomorphologic features. CASES: Bronchial brush and wash samples were obtained from the lungs of a 63-year-old woman and a 65-year-old man for the evaluation of lung tumors. Examination of the bronchial samples revealed many large clusters of atypical cells containing abundant intracytoplasmic mucin. Although the clusters were equivocal in the first case, the presence of more atypical cell clusters led to the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Signet-ring cell carcinoma should be considered when many atypical round cells with abundant intracytoplasmic mucin--namely, signet-ring cells--are observed along with adenocarcinomatous cells.",cancer
"Fine needle aspiration cytology in primary breast angiosarcoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Angiosarcoma of the breast is an uncommon, aggressive, vascular tumor. The cytomorphologic features of angiosarcomas have rarely been reported. CASE: The present study describes a case of breast angiosarcoma initially diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. Angiosarcoma appeared in the left breast of a 58-year-old woman after 12 years of a mastectomy (without radiotherapy) of the contralateral breast for invasive ductal carcinoma. Fine needle aspiration cytology yielded very bloody material with moderate cellularity. Microscopically, two types of cells were observed: spindle cells and epithelial-like cells with nuclear atypia. The latter were arranged in tight clusters with papillary configuration. Both cell types exhibited immunoreactivity for endothelial markers. The diagnosis of angiosarcoma was confirmed by histopathology of the surgically excised tumor. CONCLUSION: Angiosarcoma rarely occurs in the breast, and a definitive diagnosis is extremely difficult relying exclusively on cytologic features. Predominance of epithelioid cells may suggest an epithelial tumor, especially in patients with a history of breast carcinoma, whereas predominance of spindle cells can be misinterpreted as phyllodes tumor or another type of sarcoma. Cell block immunocytochemistry and tumor cell labeling with endothelial markers are necessary for accurate diagnosis.",cancer
"Cytomorphology, ultrastructural, and cytogenetic findings in follicular dendritic cell sarcoma: a case report. BACKGROUND: Follicular dendritic cell (FDC) sarcoma is a rare low-to-intermediate grade malignant dendritic cell neoplasm that often has an indolent clinical course. FDC sarcomas are often misdiagnosed on aspiration cytology. CASE: A 26-year-old woman presented with a solid, slowly growing, painless mass in her right neck for 3 months. Computed tomography revealed a 3.6-cm, well-defined homogenous solid mass located posterior to the mandible and submandibular glands. Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed many large, spindle to ovoid epithelioid cells in singles, small clusters, and syncytial sheets with moderate to abundant cytoplasm, indistinct cell borders, irregular nuclear membrane, fine to vesicular chromatin, and conspicuous nucleoli. The background contained many small mature lymphocytes intimately mixed with large epithelioid tumor cells. Tumor cells were strongly positive for CD21, CD35, CD23, and fascin. Diagnosis of FDC sarcoma was rendered; follow-up surgical resection and ultrastructural study confirmed the diagnosis. The cytogenetic study showed a normal female karyotype 46,XX. CONCLUSION: Although the cytomorphology of FDC sarcoma is characteristic, a preoperative diagnosis of FDC sarcoma based on fine needle aspiration cytology is very challenging, if not impossible. Immunohistochemistry is always necessary for rendering and/or confirming the diagnosis, and ultrastructural studies are helpful.",cancer
"Fine needle aspiration cytology of ductal adenoma of the breast with intracellular mucin: a report of three cases. BACKGROUND: Ductal adenoma of the breast is a benign lesion that can mimic both the clinical and cytopathologic features of carcinoma. Benign breast lesions with intracellular mucin are extremely rare, and ductal adenoma with intracellular mucin has not previously been reported. Here we present three cases of ductal adenoma of the breast with foci of intracellular mucin. CASES: Three patients were admitted to Tokai University School of Medicine Hospital and underwent fine needle aspiration cytology and histologic examination by excisional biopsy or partial resection. Fine needle aspiration cytology was performed using a 23-gauge needle, and smears were immediately fixed in ethanol and stained as Papanicolaou preparations. Epithelial cells formed cohesive clusters, consisting of biphasic luminal and myoepithelial cells accompanied by apocrine metaplasia with occasional high nuclear atypia. All three cases showed intracellular mucin, in varying amounts, which led to their being overdiagnosed as malignant lesions. CONCLUSION: To avoid overdiagnosis of ductal adenomas as malignant lesions, it is important to recognize that both intracytoplasmic mucin and atypical apocrine features can be usual cytologic findings of this disease.",cancer
"Mohs surgery is effective for high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) is effective in the treatment of invasive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). High-risk SCC has a more guarded prognosis. OBJECTIVES: To report the outcome of patients with high-risk SCCs treated with MMS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two hundred fifteen patients with 260 high-risk cutaneous SCCs were reviewed in a single-center retrospective study, considering rates of recurrence, metastasis, and death. Cases were analyzed according to sex, age, immunocompetency status, tumor depth, lesion site, perineural disease, death rate, cause of death, secondary SCC, and melanoma. Seventy-seven percent of patients were male; 23% were female. Average age was 70.6. Twenty percent of patients were immunosuppressed. Mean follow-up was 3.9 years. RESULTS: There were three local recurrences (1.2%). Twelve (4.6%) tumors involved named nerve trunks. In eight of these cases, adjuvant radiation therapy was employed. Six (2.3%) tumors metastasized, with one fatality from disease. Seventy-five percent of patients developed another cutaneous SCC, and 7.7% developed a subsequent malignant melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: MMS is an effective treatment for high-risk cutaneous SCC. This represents the largest single-center study of high-risk SCC supporting the use of MMS. Adjuvant radiotherapy was reserved for large-nerve perineural disease. There was a low recurrence rate and disease-specific mortality. Prompt recognition of metastatic disease allowed for curative therapy. Patients with one high-risk SCC are likely to develop secondary primary SCC and melanoma.",cancer
"Breast cancer incidence in the randomized PEARL trial of lasofoxifene in postmenopausal osteoporotic women. BACKGROUND: Currently available selective estrogen receptor modulators reduce the risk of breast cancer, but they are not widely used. In the Postmenopausal Evaluation and Risk-Reduction with Lasofoxifene (PEARL) trial, lasofoxifene was shown to reduce the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, nonvertebral and vertebral fractures, coronary artery disease, and stroke, but the effects on total breast cancer (invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ, ER+ and estrogen receptor-negative [ER-]) and ER+ invasive breast cancer are unknown. METHODS: Postmenopausal women (n = 8556) aged 59-80 years with low bone density and normal mammograms were randomly assigned to two doses of lasofoxifene (0.25 and 0.5 mg) or placebo. The primary endpoints of the PEARL trial were incidence of ER+ breast cancer and nonvertebral fractures at 5 years. A nested case-control study of 49 incident breast cancer case patients and 156 unaffected control subjects from the PEARL trial was performed to evaluate treatment effects on risk of total and ER+ invasive breast cancer by baseline serum estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin levels using logistic regression models. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate risk of total breast cancer and ER+ invasive breast cancer using intention-to-treat analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Breast cancer was confirmed in 49 women. Compared with placebo, 0.5 mg of lasofoxifene statistically significantly reduced the risk of total breast cancer by 79% (hazard ratio = 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08 to 0.55) and ER+ invasive breast cancer by 83% (hazard ratio = 0.17; 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.57). The effects of 0.5 mg of lasofoxifene on total breast cancer were similar regardless of Gail score, whereas the effects were markedly stronger for women with baseline estradiol levels greater than the median (odds ratio = 0.11; 95% CI = 0.02 to 0.51) vs those with levels less than the median (odds ratio = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.16 to 3.79; P(interaction) = .04). CONCLUSION: A 0.5-mg dose of lasofoxifene appears to reduce the risks of both total and ER+ invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.",cancer
"MDM2 as a modifier gene in retinoblastoma. Variability in the age of onset and number of tumors is occasionally described among retinoblastoma patients, and possible genetic modifiers might lie in the pRB or p53 pathways, both of which are involved in the development of retinoblastoma. MDM2, which increases p53 and pRB catabolism, is therefore a prominent candidate. The minor allele of MDM2 that includes a 309T>G transversion (single-nucleotide polymorphism rs2279744) in the MDM2 promoter is known to enhance MDM2 expression. Its genetic transmission was studied in 326 individuals including 212 RB1 mutation carriers in 70 retinoblastoma families, and the marker genotype was tested for association with age at diagnosis and disease phenotype. In family-based association analyses, the MDM2 309G allele was found to be statistically significantly associated with incidence of bilateral or unilateral retinoblastoma among members of retinoblastoma families (Z = 3.305, two-sided exact P = .001) under a recessive model (ie, affected patients tend to be homozygous for the G allele); in transmission disequilibrium analyses using the recessive model, the association was also observed (estimated odds ratio = 4.0, 95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 12.0). The strong association of this genotype with retinoblastoma development designates MDM2 as the first modifier gene to be identified among retinoblastoma patients and suggests that enhancement of pRB haploinsufficiency and/or resistance to p53-mediated apoptosis is critical to tumor formation.",cancer
"Pretargeted 177Lu radioimmunotherapy of carcinoembryonic antigen-expressing human colonic tumors in mice. Pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) with bispecific antibodies in combination with a radiolabeled peptide reduces the radiation dose to normal tissues, especially the bone marrow. In this study, the optimization, therapeutic efficacy, and toxicity of PRIT of colon cancer with a (177)Lu-labeled peptide was determined in mice with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-expressing human tumors. METHODS: To obtain the optimal therapeutic efficacy, several strategies were evaluated to increase the total amount of radioactivity targeted to subcutaneous LS174T colon cancer tumors in BALB/c nude mice. First, the maximum amount of bispecific anti-CEA and antihapten antibody TF2 and the peptide IMP288 that could be targeted was determined. Second, the tumor targeting of repeated administrations of radiolabeled IMP288 was investigated. Mice received 1 TF2 injection, followed by multiple IMP288 injections (3-h interval) or multiple cycles, with each IMP288 administration preceded by a new TF2 injection (72-h interval). PRIT was administered at maximum doses of TF2 and (177)Lu-labeled IMP288 in groups of 9 mice with subcutaneous LS174T tumors. Mice received 1, 2, or 3 successive cycles of treatment (26 MBq/mouse/cycle) or carrier only. The primary endpoint was survival; secondary endpoints were tumor growth, body weight, bone marrow, and renal toxicity. RESULTS: The highest amount of radioactivity delivered to a subcutaneous colon tumor was achieved by the administration of 5.0 nmol of TF2 and 0.28 nmol of IMP288 in 3 successive cycles, with each IMP288 preceded by a new TF2 injection (72-h interval). PRIT effectively delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival significantly. Higher activity doses, administered in successive cycles, correlated with longer survival: the median survival of untreated mice was 13 d (range, 6-20 d), whereas that of mice treated with 1, 2, or 3 cycles of PRIT was 24 (range, 24-31 d), 45 (range, 38 >/= 130 d), and 65 (range, 48 >/= 130 d) days, respectively. Toxicity was limited: no significant changes in mean body weight were measured. Minimal changes in leukocyte counts were measured at 2 and 3 wk after injection, with full recovery within 7 wk after treatment. Platelet counts were unaffected. Serum creatinine levels were not increased significantly; thus, there was no indication of acute renal toxicity. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that PRIT in mice is an effective treatment modality against colon cancer, with limited toxicity.",cancer
"Cost-effectiveness of hybrid PET/CT for staging of non-small cell lung cancer. Although the diagnostic effectiveness of integrated PET/CT for staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has already been proven, it remains to be determined if tumor staging with combined metabolic and anatomic imaging is also cost-effective. The objective of this study was to evaluate from a payers' perspective the cost-effectiveness of staging NSCLC with CT alone (representing the mainstay diagnostic test) and with integrated PET/CT. METHODS: The study is based on 172 NSCLC patients from a prospective clinical study who underwent diagnostic, contrast-enhanced helical CT and integrated PET/CT. Imaging was performed at the University Hospital Ulm between May 2002 and December 2004. To calculate treatment costs, we differentiated among cost for diagnosis, cost for nonsurgical treatment according to the clinical diagnosis, and cost for surgical procedures according to the clinical tumor stage. RESULTS: The diagnostic effectiveness in terms of correct TNM staging was 40% (31/77) for CT alone and 60% (46/77) for PET/CT. For the assessment of resectability (tumor stages Ia-IIIa vs. IIIb-IV), 65 of 77 patients (84%) were staged correctly by PET/CT (CT alone, 70% [54/77]). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per correctly staged patient were $3,508 for PET/CT versus CT alone. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life year gained were $79,878 for PET/CT vs. CT alone, decreasing to $69,563 assuming a reduced loss of utility (0.10 quality-adjusted life years) due to surgical morbidity. CONCLUSION: Cost-effectiveness analyses showed that costs for PET/CT are within the commonly accepted range for diagnostic tests or therapies. Therefore, reimbursement of PET/CT for NSCLC staging can be also recommended from an economic point of view.",cancer
"Frequent mutation of BAP1 in metastasizing uveal melanomas. Metastasis is a defining feature of malignant tumors and is the most common cause of cancer-related death, yet the genetics of metastasis are poorly understood. We used exome capture coupled with massively parallel sequencing to search for metastasis-related mutations in highly metastatic uveal melanomas of the eye. Inactivating somatic mutations were identified in the gene encoding BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) on chromosome 3p21.1 in 26 of 31 (84%) metastasizing tumors, including 15 mutations causing premature protein termination and 5 affecting its ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase domain. One tumor harbored a frameshift mutation that was germline in origin, thus representing a susceptibility allele. These findings implicate loss of BAP1 in uveal melanoma metastasis and suggest that the BAP1 pathway may be a valuable therapeutic target.",cancer
"Approach to the patient with adrenocortical carcinoma. Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is a rare and often aggressive malignancy that requires multidisciplinary expertise for optimal management. It can present with symptoms of rapidly appearing excess steroid secretion or an abdominal mass, or it can be discovered incidentally. Thorough imaging and endocrine evaluations can identify the majority of ACCs amongst adrenal tumors; however, some smaller ACCs are better identified using fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan. Complete resection by an expert surgeon is the only potentially curative treatment for ACC, and tumor spillage should be avoided. Histopathology is important for diagnosis, but immunohistochemistry markers and gene profiling of the resected tumor may become superior to current staging systems to stratify prognosis. Despite complete resection in stage I-III tumors, approximately 40% of patients develop metastasis within 2 yr. Some retrospective studies indicate that adjuvant mitotane therapy prolongs disease-free survival, leading several centers to recommend its administration; prospective studies are under way to provide future evidence-based recommendations. For locally invading ACC, extensive en bloc resection is attempted, followed by adjuvant mitotane and, in selected cases, adjuvant radiotherapy. When ACC is not surgically resectable, mitotane therapy is adjusted to reach serum levels of 14-20 mug/ml. Careful replacement of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency after surgery or mitotane therapy is important; steroid excess from remaining tumor burden should also be controlled to avoid its morbidities. For metastatic disease, combination chemotherapy should be administered, if possible, in the context of multicenter collaborative research protocols. New insights in the molecular pathogenesis of ACC should allow the development of improved targeted therapies.",cancer
"New drugs for aggressive B-cell and T-cell lymphomas. Over the past decade an unprecedented number of new drugs for lymphomas have been developed. Most of these new drugs target molecules or pathways that are important for the growth and proliferation of lymphomas. The introduction of the B-lymphoma specific monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab, has improved the prognosis of patients with B-cell lymphomas more than any other drug in the past 50 years; today less than half of the patients with aggressive B-cell lymphomas die of their disease than in the pre-rituximab era. Many new drugs are now available for clinical testing in addition to new CD20 antibodies and antibodies directed against other surface molecules specifically or preferentially expressed on the lymphoma-cell surface. A prerequisite for the development of these drugs was the recognition of aberrant cell-signal transduction involved in lymphoma pathogenesis and progression. New therapeutic targets include receptor tyrosine and cyclin-dependent kinases, histone deacetylases, and molecules involved in the regulation of apoptosis. The definition of the role of these new drugs alone or in combination with established chemotherapy regimens in adequately designed prospective trials represents one of the major challenges in clinical lymphoma research.",cancer
"Preoperative CA 125 tumour marker in endometrial cancer: correlation with advanced stage disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if a preoperative serum CA 125 level>or=35 kU/L in patients with endometrial cancer correlates with a surgical stage III or IV and poor histopathological prognostic factors. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 254 patients who underwent hysterectomy and full staging for endometrial cancer. Preoperative serum CA 125 was available for each patient as well as complete clinical and histopathological data. Chi-square, Fisher exact test, multivariate logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve curves were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 186 (73%) patients had stage I or II disease and 68 (27%) had stage III or IV disease. A statistically higher number of patients from the stage III or IV group had a serum CA 125 level>or=35 kU/L (58%) compared with the stage I or II group (16%) (OR 7.44; P<0.001). There was no correlation between serum CA 125 level and histological subtype. Patients with stage I or II disease and serum CA 125>or=35 kU/L (46%) had significantly more frequent deep myometrial invasion (>50%) than did those with serum CA 125<35 kU/L (18%) (OR 3.68; P=0.006). CONCLUSION: Assay of the preoperative serum CA 125 level is a very simple test to detect patients with more advanced stage endometrial adenocarcinoma. Its routine use could help triage high risk patients preoperatively.",cancer
"Androgen receptor epigenetic variations influence early follicular phase gonadotropin levels. OBJECTIVE: we examined the influence of the androgen receptor gene (AR) CAG microsatellite (AR-CAG) repeat polymorphism and X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) pattern on ovarian reserve markers (follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and antral follicle count on menstrual cycle day 3-5) and disease etiology in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or premature ovarian failure (POF). DESIGN: case-control study. Population. In all, 32 women with PCOS, 26 women with POF and 79 controls were investigated. METHODS: AR-CAG and XCI were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-based assays following DNA digestion with the methylation-sensitive restrictase HpaII. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: distribution of AR-CAG alleles and XCI patterns. RESULTS: POF patients had shorter AR-CAG microsatellites than controls. AR-CAG microsatellite length was negatively associated with serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate level. The magnitude of XCI skewing was negatively and positively correlated with luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH serum levels, respectively, during the early follicular phase, but showed no correlation with the number of early antral follicles. CONCLUSIONS: our results suggest that AR-CAG variations and XCI pattern exert an effect on FSH and LH values, and also have the potential to influence the etiopathogenesis of POF.",cancer
"Ki-67 proliferation rate as a prognostic marker in major salivary gland carcinomas. OBJECTIVES: The study was performed to evaluate the prognostic relevance of cell proliferation associated with Ki-67/ Mib-1 immunostaining in malignant tumors of the major salivary glands. METHODS: Cell proliferation was evaluated by Mib-1 antibody against Ki-67 antigen in 41 patients with cancer of the parotid or submandibular glands, including 14 acinic cell carcinomas, 12 ductal carcinomas, 7 mucoepidermoid carcinomas, 5 carcinomas ex pleomorphic adenoma, 1 adenoid cystic carcinoma, 1 undifferentiated carcinoma, and 1 polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Patients with Ki-67 values of more than 15% and those with Ki-67 values of 15% or less differed both in disease-free survival (p < 0.001) and in overall survival (p < 0.001). We evaluated the association between Ki-67 and time to recurrence in correlation to age, sex, ductal histotype, and N stage; the Cox regression model was significant (p = 0.013). In the group of patients with T1 and T2 cancers, those with Ki-67 values of 15% or less had better survival rates than did those with Ki-67 values of more than 15% (p = 0.004). In the group of patients with N0 cancers, those with Ki-67 values of 15% or less had a better survival than did those with Ki-67 values of more than 15% (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to stratify different risk classes in early T1-T2 or N0 malignant tumors of the major salivary glands that identified aggressive lesions with elevated Ki-67 expression at an initial stage.",cancer
"Intentions to use hypnosis to control the side effects of cancer and its treatment. Evidence suggests that hypnosis is an effective intervention for reducing distress, pain and other side effects associated with cancer and its treatment. However, hypnosis has failed to be adopted into standard clinical practice. This study (n = 115) investigated overall intentions to use hypnosis to control side effects of cancer and its treatment, as well as demographic predictors of such intentions among healthy volunteers. Results suggest that the vast majority of participants (89%) would be willing to use hypnosis to control side effects associated with cancer treatment. Mean intention levels did not differ by gender, ethnicity, education or age. These results indicate that in the general public, there is a willingness to consider the use of hypnosis, and that willingness is not determined by demographic factors.

"The impact of videorecording on the quality of colonoscopy performance: a pilot study. OBJECTIVES: Colonoscopy provides imperfect protection against colorectal cancer and is operator dependent. Colonoscopies typically are poorly documented. We aimed to determine whether videorecording impacts short-term performance of colonoscopy. METHODS: We videorecorded routine colonoscopies by seven colonoscopists, with and without their awareness. Colonoscopy quality was measured by blinded assessment of inspection time and technique. RESULTS: From pre- to post-awareness of videorecording, mean inspection time increased by 49% for all colonoscopies combined and increased significantly for four individual colonoscopists. The overall quality of mucosal inspection technique improved by 31% after awareness of videorecording. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of videorecording improved physician performance of colonoscopy. Further investigation of the role of videorecording in achieving sustained improvements in the quality performance of colonoscopy, including increases in adenoma detection, is warranted.",cancer
"Multispectral real-time fluorescence imaging for intraoperative detection of the sentinel lymph node in gynecologic oncology. The prognosis in virtually all solid tumors depends on the presence or absence of lymph node metastases. Surgical treatment most often combines radical excision of the tumor with a full lymphadenectomy in the drainage area of the tumor. However, removal of lymph nodes is associated with increased morbidity due to infection, wound breakdown and lymphedema. As an alternative, the sentinel lymph node procedure (SLN) was developed several decades ago to detect the first draining lymph node from the tumor. In case of lymphogenic dissemination, the SLN is the first lymph node that is affected (Figure 1). Hence, if the SLN does not contain metastases, downstream lymph nodes will also be free from tumor metastases and need not to be removed. The SLN procedure is part of the treatment for many tumor types, like breast cancer and melanoma, but also for cancer of the vulva and cervix. The current standard methodology for SLN-detection is by peritumoral injection of radiocolloid one day prior to surgery, and a colored dye intraoperatively. Disadvantages of the procedure in cervical and vulvar cancer are multiple injections in the genital area, leading to increased psychological distress for the patient, and the use of radioactive colloid. Multispectral fluorescence imaging is an emerging imaging modality that can be applied intraoperatively without the need for injection of radiocolloid. For intraoperative fluorescence imaging, two components are needed: a fluorescent agent and a quantitative optical system for intraoperative imaging. As a fluorophore we have used indocyanine green (ICG). ICG has been used for many decades to assess cardiac function, cerebral perfusion and liver perfusion. It is an inert drug with a safe pharmaco-biological profile. When excited at around 750 nm, it emits light in the near-infrared spectrum around 800 nm. A custom-made multispectral fluorescence imaging camera system was used. The aim of this video article is to demonstrate the detection of the SLN using intraoperative fluorescence imaging in patients with cervical and vulvar cancer. Fluorescence imaging is used in conjunction with the standard procedure, consisting of radiocolloid and a blue dye. In the future, intraoperative fluorescence imaging might replace the current method and is also easily transferable to other indications like breast cancer and melanoma.",cancer
"Reimbursement policy and androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: The Medicare Modernization Act led to moderate reductions in reimbursement for androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer, starting in 2004 and followed by substantial changes in 2005. We hypothesized that these reductions would lead to decreases in the use of ADT for indications that were not evidence based. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare database, we identified 54,925 men who received a diagnosis of incident prostate cancer from 2003 through 2005. We divided these men into groups according to the strength of the indication for ADT use. The use of ADT was deemed to be inappropriate as primary therapy for men with localized cancers of a low-to-moderate grade (for whom a survival benefit of such therapy was improbable), appropriate as adjuvant therapy with radiation therapy for men with locally advanced cancers (for whom a survival benefit was established), and discretionary for men receiving either primary or adjuvant therapy for localized but high-grade tumors. The proportion of men receiving ADT was calculated according to the year of diagnosis for each group. We used modified Poisson regression models to calculate the effect of the year of diagnosis on the use of ADT. RESULTS: The rate of inappropriate use of ADT declined substantially during the study period, from 38.7% in 2003 to 30.6% in 2004 to 25.7% in 2005 (odds ratio for ADT use in 2005 vs. 2003, 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.79). There was no decrease in the appropriate use of adjuvant ADT (odds ratio, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.19). In cases involving discretionary use, there was a significant decline in use in 2005 but not in 2004. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in the Medicare reimbursement policy in 2004 and 2005 were associated with reductions in ADT use, particularly among men for whom the benefits of such therapy were unclear.

"Brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35) for relapsed CD30-positive lymphomas. BACKGROUND: Hodgkin's lymphoma and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma are the two most common tumors expressing CD30. Previous attempts to target the CD30 antigen with monoclonal-based therapies have shown minimal activity. To enhance the antitumor activity of CD30-directed therapy, the antitubulin agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) was attached to a CD30-specific monoclonal antibody by an enzyme-cleavable linker, producing the antibody-drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin (SGN-35). METHODS: In this phase 1, open-label, multicenter dose-escalation study, we administered brentuximab vedotin (at a dose of 0.1 to 3.6 mg per kilogram of body weight) every 3 weeks to 45 patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive hematologic cancers, primarily Hodgkin's lymphoma and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. Patients had received a median of three previous chemotherapy regimens (range, one to seven), and 73% had undergone autologous stem-cell transplantation. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose was 1.8 mg per kilogram, administered every 3 weeks. Objective responses, including 11 complete remissions, were observed in 17 patients. Of 12 patients who received the 1.8-mg-per-kilogram dose, 6 (50%) had an objective response. The median duration of response was at least 9.7 months. Tumor regression was observed in 36 of 42 patients who could be evaluated (86%). The most common adverse events were fatigue, pyrexia, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia, and peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Brentuximab vedotin induced durable objective responses and resulted in tumor regression for most patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive lymphomas in this phase 1 study. Treatment was associated primarily with grade 1 or 2 (mild-to-moderate) toxic effects. (Funded by Seattle Genetics; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00430846.).",cancer
"Everolimus for subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in tuberous sclerosis. BACKGROUND: Neurosurgical resection is the standard treatment for subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex. An alternative may be the use of everolimus, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, a protein regulated by gene products involved in the tuberous sclerosis complex. METHODS: Patients 3 years of age or older with serial growth of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas were eligible for this open-label study. The primary efficacy end point was the change in volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas between baseline and 6 months. We gave everolimus orally, at a dose of 3.0 mg per square meter of body-surface area, to achieve a trough concentration of 5 to 15 ng per milliliter. RESULTS: We enrolled 28 patients. Everolimus therapy was associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in volume of the primary subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma, as assessed on independent central review (P<0.001 for baseline vs. 6 months), with a reduction of at least 30% in 21 patients (75%) and at least 50% in 9 patients (32%). Marked reductions were seen within 3 months and were sustained. There were no new lesions, worsening hydrocephalus, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, or necessity for surgical resection or other therapy for subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. Of the 16 patients for whom 24-hour video electroencephalography data were available, seizure frequency for the 6-month study period (vs. the previous 6-month period) decreased in 9, did not change in 6, and increased in 1 (median change, -1 seizure; P=0.02). The mean (+/-SD) score on the validated Quality-of-Life in Childhood Epilepsy questionnaire (on which scores can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating a better quality of life) was improved at 3 months (63.4+/-12.4) and 6 months (62.1+/-14.2) over the baseline score (57.8+/-14.0). Single cases of grade 3 treatment-related sinusitis, pneumonia, viral bronchitis, tooth infection, stomatitis, and leukopenia were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus therapy was associated with marked reduction in the volume of subependymal giant-cell astrocytomas and seizure frequency and may be a potential alternative to neurosurgical resection in some cases, though long-term studies are needed.

"Family caregivers of palliative cancer patients at home: the puzzle of pain management. The purpose of this grounded theory study was to understand the processes used by family caregivers to manage the pain of cancer patients at home. A total of 24 family caregivers participated. They were recruited using purposeful then theoretical sampling. The data sources were taped, transcribed (semi-structured) interviews and field notes. Data analysis was based on Strauss and Corbin's (1998) requirements for open, axial, and selective coding. The result was an explanatory model titled ""the puzzle of pain management,"" which includes four main processes: ""drawing on past experiences""; ""strategizing a game plan""; ""striving to respond to pain""; and ""gauging the best fit,"" a decision-making process that joins the puzzle pieces. Understanding how family caregivers assemble their puzzle pieces can help health care professionals make decisions related to the care plans they create for pain control and help them to recognize the importance of providing information as part of resolving the puzzle of pain management.",cancer
"The effectiveness and adverse effects profile of ""burst"" ketamine in refractory cancer pain: The VCOG PM 1-00 study. This multi-centre study of adjuvant ""burst"" ketamine in palliative care in-patients documents its effectiveness, duration of pain relief, and adverse effects (AE) profile. Patients received a three-to-five day continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI) of ketamine escalated from 100 to 300 to 500 mg/24 hours if required. When the effective or maximum tolerated dose was attained, the infusion was continued for three days and each patient assessed as a responder or non-responder using strict criteria. The response rate was 22/44 (50 percent), with 4 (9 percent) becoming pain-free. Pain relief lasting two or more weeks was documented in 50 percent of responders. AEs were documented daily using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria 0-4 scales. There were 11 grade 3 and 4 neurological AEs. However, no responders elected to cease treatment early due to neurological AEs. We concluded that this protocol in the controlled environment of an in-patient PC unit is relatively safe and simple with reasonable effectiveness.",cancer
"What really matters in pain management for terminally ill cancer patients in Taiwan. The paradox of patients who are in pain yet satisfied with their pain management has been documented repeatedly. Pain relief constitutes only one part of patient satisfaction with pain management. The quality of cancer pain management in Taiwan has not been evaluated from the patient's perspective. A cross-sectional design was used to survey 1,370 terminally ill cancer patients in Taiwan to characterize the status of, and satisfaction with cancer pain management by investigating the relative importance of pain intensity, pain relief experiences, and clinicians' pain management practices. Cancer patients with pain had unsatisfactory pain relief within one week of admission (47.4 percent) and inadequate pain medication (23.6 percent). However, these patients perceived that clinicians adequately informed them about pain treatment. Patient satisfaction with pain management was primarily determined by examining the perceptions that medication dose was just right, responses to requests for pain medication were prompt, and understandable and consistent information about pain treatment was offered. In conclusion, Taiwanese cancer patients' satisfaction with pain management was influenced more by perceived pain management practices than by pain relief itself.",cancer
"Human papillomavirus disease and vaccines in adolescents. Review of the most recent evidence indicates that screening for cervical cancer in females younger than 21 years of age likely leads to more harm than good. In addition, screening during adolescence has not lead to decreased cervical cancers in this age group. The rate of cervical cancer remains extremely low in adolescents. In contrast, abnormal cytology is extremely common, of which most is benign. Hence, referral to colposcopy is unnecessary and costly. New guidelines recommend cervical cancer screening to start at the age of 21 years and to not be based on sexual behavior. The exception is for immunocompromised girls, who should be screened once intercourse is initiated, since they are at increased risk for cervical cancer. Recently, we have also broadened our understanding about human papillomavirus-associated disease in men. In this chapter, we cover the advances in science that have led to new screening recommendation for cervical cancer and the advances in prevention: vaccines for both adolescent women and men.",cancer
"Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and infectious mononucleosis. Infectious mononucleosis (IM) is a clinical syndrome that is common in adolescents and young adults and is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, and fatigue. IM is most commonly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in which case laboratory findings include a lymphocytosis with an elevated number of atypical lymphocytes seen on peripheral smear and a heterophile or EBV-specific antibody response. Approximately 10% of those with IM will not be acutely infected with EBV. Many of these individuals will have their symptoms attributed to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. This chapter reviews the history, diagnosis, clinical management, and potential complications of both EBV- and CMV-associated IM in adolescents and young adults.",cancer
"Screening of natural products for therapeutic activity against solid tumors. Most of the currently used cancer therapeutics are natural products. These agents were generally discovered based on their toxicity to tumour cells using various bioassays. Although the exact mechanisms of action of the most commonly used cancer therapeutics such as anthracyclins, podophyllotoxins and camptothecin are incompletely understood, it is becoming increasingly clear that these agents often show complex modes of action at the cellular level, interacting with numerous targets. Such complex modes of action may be the very reason for clinical efficacy. For discovering new cytotoxic anticancer drugs sophisticated screening methods were used. The principles of such screening projects conducted, using collections of purified natural products or extracts from plants have been described. By performing simple but robust prescreening tests such as the brine shrimp assay, bioactive extracts can be identified. Extracts (65) prepared from a collection of Egyptian plants were identified that showed cytotoxity on HepG2 cells. Interestingly, 22 (33%) of these raw extracts, induced > 2-fold induction of caspase-cleavage activity in a colon carcinoma cell line, consistent with induction of apoptosis. Only a fraction of the diversity of the biosphere has been tested for biological activity and novel cancer therapeutics remains to be discovered.",cancer
"How do specialist breast nurses help breast cancer patients at follow-up? BACKGROUND: As the proportion of survivors from breast cancer increases it is possible that follow-up care could be delivered wholly by generalists to relieve over subscribed hospital clinics. However, guidelines seldom take into account the nature of interactions between patients and health care professionals involved in hospital-based follow-up. METHODS: Consultations between four Specialist Breast Nurses (SBNs) and 21 consecutive women attending a hospital-based breast cancer follow-up clinic in Western Australia were audio recorded and subjected to a thematic analysis. Recording of consultations ceased with saturation of themes. We analysed the data with reference to theoretical frameworks which postulate that social support is a powerful factor in determining positive health outcomes. We also drew on theories focusing on biographical disruption, biographical reinforcement and biographical reinvention. RESULTS: The majority of participants were Australian born, married women in their sixties. The mean duration of the consultations was 19 min (SD = 7.5, min = 8, max = 43.5). A core theme was the established relationship between the woman and her SBN. Overall, the SBNs played an important role in facilitating the transition of patients by supporting the woman in adjustment to a new self-image and bodily functioning. The SBN accompanies each woman through this phase in her life, white supporting a new narrative, promoting her 'rebirth' as someone with ideas, concerns and expectations that have altered significantly after the diagnosis of cancer. Five key themes emerged to demonstrate this supportive role: normalising; facilitating access to services; prevention; promoting self-esteem and promoting a proactive approach. CONCLUSIONS: Many women with breast cancer claimed a new perspective on what was now possible, acceptable or desirable in a host of life domains. Our data suggest that the follow-up care of cancer patients is more than just dealing with a checklist of symptoms but requires an understanding of the biographical disruption occasioned by a diagnosis of breast cancer.",cancer
"Long-term safety, tolerability, and consistency of effect of fentanyl pectin nasal spray for breakthrough cancer pain in opioid-tolerant patients. OBJECTIVE: to assess the long-term safety, tolerability, and consistency of effect of fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS) in patients with breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP). DESIGN: a multicenter, open-label study. PATIENTS: patients with chronic cancer pain treated with > or = 60 mg/d oral morphine or equivalent experiencing 1-4 episodes per day of BTCP. INTERVENTION: all patients entered into a 16-week treatment phase after undergoing a dose-titration phase with FPNS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: safety and tolerability were assessed by adverse events (AEs) and by nasal tolerability assessments. Consistency of effect was monitored through additional rescue medication use and FPNS dose change. RESULTS: four hundred three patients were included in the safety analyses. Of these, 356 patients entered the treatment phase and 110 patients completed the study. FPNS was self-administered for 42,227 episodes. During the treatment phase, 99 patients (24.6 percent) reported treatment-related AEs; most were mild or moderate and typical of opioids. Serious AEs were reported by 61 patients (15.1 percent), but only five were considered related to study drug. Of the 80 deaths that occurred during this study, one was assessed as possibly related to study drug. Nasal assessments revealed no significant local effects. No additional rescue medication was required after 94 percent of FPNS-treated episodes. More than 90 percent of patients required no increase in their initial dose of FPNS. CONCLUSIONS: FPNS use for BTCP was associated with AEs, typical of opioids, with no evidence of nasal toxicity. A large proportion of BTCP episodes were treated with a single dose, and doses remained stable over the 4-month period.",cancer

"CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling axis confers gemcitabine resistance to pancreatic cancer cells: a novel target for therapy. BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer cells are highly resistant to drug therapy; however, underlying causes remain largely unknown. We hypothesised that the activation of CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling confers drug resistance to pancreatic cancer cells by potentiating survival. CXCR4 is overexpressed in precancerous/malignant pancreatic lesions and cancer stem cells, and implicated in its pathogenesis. METHODS: Effect of CXCR4 activation by CXCL12 on restricting the gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity and stimulating the survival signalling was examined in pancreatic cancer cells by MTT, DNA laddering, caspase activity, immunoblot, and promoter-reporter assays. Subsequently, we examined the effect of CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, in abrogating the rescue effect of activated CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling. RESULTS: The pancreatic cancer cells treated with gemcitabine exhibited reduced cytotoxicity in the presence of CXCL12 as compared with the cells treated with drug alone. CXCL12 induced the activation of FAK, ERK, and Akt signalling pathways, enhanced transcriptional activities of beta-catenin and NF-kappaB, and expression of survival proteins. AMD3100 arrested the CXCL12-induced pancreatic cancer cell growth and drug resistance. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate, for the first time, a role of CXCL12-CXCR4 signalling axis in conferring drug resistance to pancreatic cancer cells and suggest that it could serve as a novel therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer therapy, alone and in combination with the cytotoxic drug.",cancer
"Determinants of age at menarche in the UK: analyses from the Breakthrough Generations Study. BACKGROUND: Early menarche increases breast cancer risk but, aside from weight, information on its determinants is limited. METHODS: Age at menarche data were collected retrospectively by questionnaire from 81,606 women aged 16-98, resident in the UK and participating in the Breakthrough Generations Study. RESULTS: Menarche occurred earlier in women who had a low birthweight (P(trend)<0.001), were singletons (P<0.001), had prenatal exposure to pre-eclampsia (P<0.001) or maternal smoking (P=0.01), were not breastfed (P(trend)=0.03), were non-white (P<0.001), were heavy (P(trend)<0.001) or tall (P(trend)<0.001) compared with their peers at age 7 and exercised little as a child (P(trend)<0.001). Menarcheal age increased with number of siblings (P<0.001) independently of birth order, and had an inverse association with birth order after adjustment for sibship size (P<0.001). In a multivariate model, birthweight, ethnicity, weight, height, exercise, sibship size and birth order remained significant, and maternal age at birth became significant (positive association, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Age at menarche was influenced by both pre- and post-natal factors, and these factors may affect breast cancer risk through this route.",cancer
"A phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate safety and tolerability of sorafenib combined with sirolimus in patients with advanced solid cancer. BACKGROUND: The combination of sorafenib (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 inhibitor) and sirolimus (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) might work synergistically. METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study with sorafenib twice a day (b.i.d.) and sirolimus once daily (q.d.) was performed to determine the recommended dose of the combination in patients with solid tumours. Secondary objectives were to determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicities were transaminitis and cutaneous toxicity. The most frequently reported adverse events were elevated transaminases, hypophosphatemia, fatigue, anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia. Sirolimus did not change the PK of sorafenib; in contrast, sorafenib reduced the AUC(0-96) and C(max) of sirolimus. No objective responses were observed; eight patients showed stable disease for a median of 16.3 weeks (range 8-24). The MTD of the combination was sorafenib 200 mg b.i.d. with sirolimus 1 mg q.d. CONCLUSION: The combination of sorafenib and sirolimus showed enhanced toxicity, which could not be explained by the PK of both drugs. The relative low doses at the MTD, in combination with the PK results, do not warrant further development of this combination.",cancer
"Prevention of tumour cell dissemination in diagnostic needle procedures. BACKGROUND: A side effect of diagnostic needle biopsies is the possibility to disseminate tumour cells into the needle track, which may cause concern in certain malignant tumour types. METHODS: In order to prevent tumour cell dissemination we developed a technology that uses radiofrequency (RF) pulses to sterilise the needle track and denaturate tumour cells. To determine feasibility, we applied this technology to fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and used breast cancer as a model tumour. Routine FNAB was performed in 88 patients with adenocarcinoma and blood droplets passing the skin orifice were cytomorphologically analysed for the presence of tumour cells. RESULTS: The analysis showed the presence of tumour cells in 65/88 cases (74%). When using an experimental anti-seeding device in a subset of patients viable tumour cells were found in 0/31 cases (P<0.001). In all 31 patients blood passing the skin orifice was sparse. No degrading effect on the cytological sample inside the needle was detected and pain caused by the RF pulses was comparable to that of the biopsy procedure itself. CONCLUSION: The herein presented method has the potential to prevent the dissemination of viable tumour cells in the needle track and minimize bleeding without additional pain or degradation of the aspirate.",cancer
"The utility and cost of routine follow-up procedures in the surveillance of ovarian and primary peritoneal carcinoma: a 16-year institutional review. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the number of ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal cancer (PPC) progressive disease cases identified via routine follow-up procedures and the corresponding cost throughout a 16-year period at a single medical institution. METHODS: Previously undiagnosed epithelial ovarian (n=241), PPC (n=23), and concurrent ovarian and uterine (n=24) cancer patients were treated and then followed via CA-125, imaging (e.g., CT scan, chest X-ray), physical examination and vaginal cytology. RESULTS: In the group of 287 patients, there were 151 cases of disease progression. Serial imaging detected the highest number of progressive disease cases (66 initial and 45 confirmatory diagnoses), but the cost was rather high ($13,454 per patient recurrence), whereas CA-125 testing (74 initial and 20 corroborative diagnoses) was the least expensive ($3,924) per recurrent diagnosis. The total cost of surveillance during the 16-year period was nearly $2,400,000. CONCLUSION: Ultimately, serial imaging and the CA-125 assay detected the highest number of ovarian cancer and PCC progressive disease cases in comparison to physical examination and vaginal cytology, but nevertheless, all of the procedures were conducted at a considerable financial expense.",cancer
"Oral contraceptives, reproductive history and risk of colorectal cancer in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptive use and reproductive factors may initiate long-term changes to the hormonal milieu and thereby, possibly influence colorectal cancer risk. METHODS: We examined the association of hormonal and reproductive factors with risk of colorectal cancer among 337,802 women in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, of whom 1878 developed colorectal cancer. RESULTS: After stratification for center and age, and adjustment for body mass index, smoking, diabetes mellitus, physical activity and alcohol consumption, ever use of oral contraceptives was marginally inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk (hazard ratio (HR), 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.83-1.02), although this association was stronger among post-menopausal women (HR, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74-0.95). Duration of oral contraceptive use and reproductive factors, including age at menarche, age at menopause, type of menopause, ever having an abortion, parity, age at first full-term pregnancy and breastfeeding, were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide limited support for a potential inverse association between oral contraceptives and colorectal cancer risk.",cancer
"Assessment of preclinical learning on oral surgery using three instructional strategies. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate three learning methods for teaching basic oral surgical skills. Thirty predoctoral dental students without any surgical knowledge or previous surgical experience were divided into three groups (n=10 each) according to instructional strategy: Group 1, active learning; Group 2, text reading only; and Group 3, text reading and video demonstration. After instruction, the apprentices were allowed to practice incision, dissection, and suture maneuvers in a bench learning model. During the students' performance, a structured practice evaluation test to account for correct or incorrect maneuvers was applied by trained observers. Evaluation tests were repeated after thirty and sixty days. Data from resulting scores between groups and periods were considered for statistical analysis (ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer) with a significant level of a=0.05. Results showed that the active learning group presented the significantly best learning outcomes related to immediate assimilation of surgical procedures compared to other groups. All groups' results were similar after sixty days of the first practice. Assessment tests were fundamental to evaluate teaching strategies and allowed theoretical and proficiency learning feedbacks. Repetition and interactive practice promoted retention of knowledge on basic oral surgical skills.",cancer
"Survival of MUTYH-associated polyposis patients with colorectal cancer and matched control colorectal cancer patients. BACKGROUND: MUTYH-associated polyposis is a recessively inherited disorder characterized by a lifetime risk of colorectal cancer that is up to 100%. Because specific histological and molecular genetic features of MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancers might influence tumor behavior and patient survival, we compared survival between patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer and matched control patients with colorectal cancer from the general population. METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter cohort study from Europe, 147 patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer were compared with 272 population-based control patients with colorectal cancer who were matched for country, age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, stage, and subsite of colorectal cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were used to compare survival between patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer and control patients with colorectal cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Five-year survival for patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer was 78% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 70% to 84%) and for control patients was 63% (95% CI = 56% to 69%) (log-rank test, P = .002). After adjustment for differences in age, stage, sex, subsite, country, and year of diagnosis, survival remained better for MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer patients than for control patients (hazard ratio of death = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.32 to 0.72). CONCLUSIONS: In a European study cohort, we found statistically significantly better survival for patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis colorectal cancer than for matched control patients with colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Early complications after nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction with silicone prosthesis: results of 214 procedures. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: breast reconstruction with silicone prosthesis following nipple-sparing mastectomy has become widely accepted as a reconstruction option in women requiring mastectomy for cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and some factors influencing early local complications in patients undergoing NSM with immediate implant reconstruction. MATERIAL AND METHODS: prospective study was performed on a consecutive series of 214 breast reconstructions in 205 patients. All complications during the six weeks after surgery were recorded. 42 prostheses were implanted after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 27 patients previously had radiotherapy due to breast conserving surgery and in all other cases surgery was the pri-mary treatment for cancer. RESULTS: the overall six-week complication rate was 16% (35) and included: major skin flap necrosis (4%, 9 procedures), minor skin necrosis (3%, 7), major infection (2%, 5), minor infection (3%, 7), prolonged seroma formation (3%, 6), haematoma (1%, 2) and epidermolysis (1%, 2). In 6% (12) reconstruction procedures explantation of prosthesis was done. Neoadjuvant chemo-therapy and radiotherapy were not associated with higher rate of complications. CONCLUSION: nipple-sparing mastectomy with immediate implant reconstruction has acceptable morbidity rate in the hand of experienced oncoplastic surgeon and therefore should be considered as treatment option to women requiring mastectomy.",cancer
"Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, highly aggressive neuroendocrine cutaneous neoplasm with a variable clinical presentation. Histologically, it is a predominantly dermal-based lesion composed of monotonous small round cells with scanty cytoplasm, often difficult to differentiate from small round cell tumors, metastatic small cell carcinoma, blastic hematologic malignancies, and melanoma. The malignant cells express both epithelial and neuroendocrine immunohistochemical markers, a unique feature that helps differentiate this neoplasm from other entities. The pathogenesis of Merkel cell carcinoma has remained a mystery despite its association with various chromosomal abnormalities and with growth signaling and apoptotic pathways. The discovery of the Merkel cell polyomavirus suggests another clue to its pathogenesis. This virus integrates into band 3p14 and promotes carcinogenesis by altering the activity of tumor suppressor and cell cycle regulatory proteins. This discovery of the Merkel cell polyomavirus may greatly enhance our understanding of this rare aggressive neoplasm and allow further advancements in treatment.",cancer
"The small cell variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Anaplastic large cell lymphomas constitute a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms that are characterized by immunopositivity for CD30 and the presence, in varying degrees, of large, pleomorphic ""hallmark"" cells. Primary systemic anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas are a subset of this group. Numerous heterogeneous histomorphologic patterns have been described in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive anaplastic large cell lymphomas, and all patterns tend to have a better prognosis than that found in anaplastic lymphoma kinase-negative cases. We provide a short review of the small cell variant of anaplastic large cell lymphoma to facilitate the diagnosis of this difficult-to-recognize entity, which may be confused with reactive processes, commonly presents with disseminated disease, and pursues an aggressive clinical course.",cancer
"Expression patterns of PAX5, c-Met, and paxillin in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. CONTEXT: c-Met is important in the pathogenesis, invasion, and spread of several forms of lung cancer, and multiple c-Met inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials. PAX5 has been shown to upregulate c-Met in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), and coinhibiting PAX5 and c-Met had a synergic effect in killing tumor cells. Paxillin is a downstream target of activated c-Met, and its activation leads to enhanced cell motility and tumor spread. The expression patterns of these functionally related proteins have not, to our knowledge, been systemically studied in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression patterns of PAX5, paxillin, c-Met, and phosphorylated c-Met in 4 categories of pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. DESIGN: Tissue microarrays of 38 typical carcinoids, 6 atypical carcinoids, 34 SCLCs, and 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas were studied with immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Most of the 4 tumor types expressed c-Met, phosphorylated c-Met, and paxillin. PAX5 was frequently expressed in atypical carcinoids, SCLCs, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas but tended to be negative in typical carcinoids. Coexpression of PAX5 with c-Met or phosphorylated c-Met was present in most of the atypical carcinoids, SCLCs, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. Significant correlation between PAX5 and paxillin was detected in SCLCs and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas but not in carcinoid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: The frequent coexpression of PAX5 with c-Met or phosphorylated c-Met in intermediate-grade and high-grade neuroendocrine tumors supports the therapeutic strategy of coinhibiting these proteins. The discrepancy between high-grade and low-grade neuroendocrine tumors in PAX5/paxillin expression correlation may be due to the different underlying molecular genetics of these tumors.",cancer
"Can features evaluated in the routine pathologic assessment of lymph node-negative estrogen receptor-positive stage I or II invasive breast cancer be used to predict the Oncotype DX recurrence score? CONTEXT: Oncotype DX is a multigene reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay used to quantify recurrence risk in patients with stage I or II estrogen receptor-positive, lymph node-negative invasive breast cancer. The results are reported as a Recurrence Score (RS). The 16 cancer genes evaluated include a proliferation set, hormone receptor set, and HER2 set. The activity of these genes is addressed by pathologic assessment of breast cancers. OBJECTIVE: To determine if factors evaluated in pathologic evaluation of breast cancer could be used to predict Oncotype DX results. DESIGN: We studied 138 cases of invasive breast cancer for which Oncotype DX results and pathology data were available. Grading was performed by using Nottingham grading system. For hormone receptor immunostaining, 10% nuclear staining was considered a positive result. RESULTS: Oncotype DX RS was low in 81 cases, intermediate in 44 cases, and high in 13 cases. All 6 cases with both a negative progesterone receptor (PR) and a mitotic count score of 3 had a high RS. All 12 cases with both a negative PR and a mitotic count score greater than 1 had either an intermediate or high RS. Although Nottingham grade, PR status, mitotic count score, tumor size, and nuclear grade were each significantly associated with RS, in bivariate analyses the only variables that remained independently predictive of an intermediate or high RS score in a multivariate logistic regression model were negative PR and mitotic count score greater than 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that a mitotic count score greater than 1 combined with a negative PR result, as determined by pathologic assessment, could serve as a marker for an intermediate or high Oncotype DX RS.",cancer
"Carcinoids and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the ampulla of vater: a comparative analysis of 139 cases from the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results program-a population based study. CONTEXT: Neuroendocrine tumors of the ampulla of Vater constitute a heterogeneous group of neoplasms clinically and morphologically. Because they are rare, little is known about their demographics and biologic behavior. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the demographics and the 5- and 10-year relative survival rates of 139 patients with carcinoid tumors and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the ampulla. DESIGN: Using data from National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from 1973 to 2006, we analyzed the demographics, morphology, and survival of patients with carcinoids and neuroendocrine carcinomas of the ampulla. RESULTS: SEER recorded 6081 cases of malignant neoplasms of the ampulla, of which 82 were carcinoid tumors and 57 were high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Of these 57, 42 were neuroendocrine carcinomas, not otherwise specified; 9 were small cell carcinomas; and 6 were large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas. The incidence was higher in men than in women. Patients with carcinoid tumors were younger (mean age, 61.6 years) than those with high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (mean age, 67.5 years). Carcinoid tumors were smaller than high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. The frequency of lymph node metastasis was 28.5% for carcinoid tumors and 62% for high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. The 5- and 10-year relative survival rates of patients with carcinoid tumors were 82% and 71%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year relative survival rate of patients with high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas was 15.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Carcinoids of the ampulla of Vater are relatively rare. Carcinoids and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas of the ampulla are biologically and clinically similar to these tumors arising in other sites. Carcinoids were smaller and metastasized less frequently than high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas.",cancer
"Sarcomatoid neoplasms of the lung and pleura. Sarcomatoid neoplasms of the lung and pleura are rare tumors that present a complex differential diagnosis, making them challenging for surgical pathologists. In the lung, the main tumors are the sarcomatoid carcinomas, including pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle cell carcinoma, giant cell carcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and pulmonary blastoma. They are characterized by histologic heterogeneity; molecular data support their origin from a pluripotent stem cell that undergoes neoplastic transformation with divergent epithelial and sarcomatous differentiation. Diagnosis is difficult in small biopsy specimens and typically requires a resection specimen. Despite the presence of sarcomatoid features, these tumors are classified as lung carcinomas. Pulmonary blastomas must be distinguished from pleuropulmonary blastomas, which are a unique type of thoracic sarcoma typically occurring in young children. In the pleura, the main tumors to consider are the sarcomatoid and desmoplastic types of malignant mesothelioma, solitary fibrous tumor, and desmoid tumor. While light microscopy is sufficient to diagnose most of these tumors, immunohistochemistry can be useful in selected settings. In particular, it can aid to confirm epithelial differentiation in spindle cell carcinomas and the presence of rhabdomyosarcoma in sarcomatoid carcinomas, mesotheliomas, or pleuropulmonary blastomas. For sarcomatoid and desmoplastic mesothelioma, keratin is the most useful stain because it can highlight invasive growth and mesothelial markers are positive in only the minority of cases. Clinical and radiologic correlation is needed to separate some pleomorphic carcinomas with pleural involvement from sarcomatoid malignant mesothelioma, since these poorly differentiated tumors may not express the usual immunohistochemical markers for carcinoma or mesothelioma.",cancer
"Parathyroid pathology: hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid tumors. CONTEXT: Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of hypercalcemia in the outpatient setting. Parathyroid adenomas are common, unlike other parathyroid tumors. This review presents a brief summary of current updates in parathyroid pathology. OBJECTIVE: To review parathyroid development and discuss issues in hyperparathyroidism and diagnosis of parathyroid lesions, including the application of immunohistochemistry and molecular biology. DATA SOURCES: Current texts, PubMed (National Library of Medicine) articles, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center archives. CONCLUSIONS: Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly seen with sporadic adenomas, followed by hyperplasia, multiple adenomas, and carcinoma. Autosomal dominant familial hyperparathyroidism syndromes should be considered in the evaluation of patients with parathyroid lesions, particularly in association with parathyroid carcinoma. While the incidence of parathyroid carcinoma is quite low, it is seen with a greater frequency in those patients with hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene HRPT2 can be identified in a large number of parathyroid carcinomas. Hence, germline HRPT2 gene mutations may reflect unrecognized syndromic patients.",cancer
"Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung: an update. CONTEXT: The 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification recognizes 4 major types of lung neuroendocrine tumors: typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, small cell lung cancer, and large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Markedly different prognostic implications and treatment paradigms for these tumors underscore the importance of accurate pathologic diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To detail the clinical and pathologic features of lung neuroendocrine tumors, with emphasis on diagnostic criteria, differential diagnoses, and application of immunohistochemistry. The emerging evidence for the utility of Ki-67 (MIB1) in the diagnosis of lung neuroendocrine tumors, particularly in small biopsy and cytology, is emphasized. DATA SOURCES: The 2004 WHO classification, other published literature, and primary material from the author's institution. CONCLUSIONS: The current WHO classification of neuroendocrine tumors is based on morphologic features in combination with precisely defined mitotic rate and absence or presence of necrosis. Ki-67 (MIB1) is emerging as a useful ancillary tool in the diagnosis of these tumors. Continued research efforts are needed to identify additional immunohistochemical and molecular biomarkers that can serve as ancillary diagnostic tools and as potential therapeutic targets for these diseases.",cancer
"Neoplasia of gallbladder and biliary epithelium. CONTEXT: Diagnosis of biliary neoplasia can be challenging but is essential for the appropriate clinical management of patients. Therefore, it is important to recognize the morphologic features of the biliary neoplasms to report a correct diagnosis. OBJECTIVES: (1) To discuss the differential diagnosis of dysplasia in the gallbladder and differentiate dysplasia from reactive atypia and invasive carcinoma, (2) review the histologic features of adenoma and polypoid biliary lesions, (3) highlight the differential diagnosis of adenocarcinoma in liver biopsy, and (4) discuss the differential diagnosis of atypical biliary glandular lesions. DATA SOURCES: Current English literature related to gallbladder and biliary neoplasia. CONCLUSIONS: Biliary glandular neoplasms show a wide spectrum of morphology and have many mimics. Careful examination of the histologic features of these lesions and familiarity with their morphology can help to achieve the correct diagnosis.",cancer
"Epithelial neoplasms of the appendix. CONTEXT: The appendix gives rise to an array of epithelial neoplasms showing glandular or neuroendocrine differentiation, and some tumors with elements of both cell types. Although some appendiceal neoplasms resemble their counterparts in the small and large intestines (conventional adenocarcinoma and carcinoid tumor), the appendix also gives rise to relatively unique entities including mucinous neoplasms and goblet cell carcinoid tumors, which present a challenge in pathologic classification and clinical management. OBJECTIVE: To review clinical and diagnostic issues for 3 pathologic types of epithelial neoplasms of the appendix: (1) adenocarcinoma, with specific focus on mucinous neoplasm; (2) goblet cell carcinoid tumor and associated adenocarcinoma; and (3) typical carcinoid tumor. DATA SOURCES: Case-derived material and literature review. CONCLUSIONS: The most important issue in pathologic assessment of epithelial tumors of the appendix is to understand the clinical implications inherent in the diagnosis.",cancer
"An update on tumors of the anal canal. CONTEXT: The anal canal possesses complex anatomy and histology and gives rise to a variety of tumor types. Challenging issues remain with regard to both the pathologic diagnosis and the clinical management of these tumors. OBJECTIVES: To provide an updated overview of the histogenesis, clinical and pathologic characteristics, diagnostic terminology, and relevant clinical management of the various types of anal canal tumors. DATA SOURCES: Recent literature on clinical and pathologic characteristics of anal canal tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Although most anal canal tumors are of squamous lineage, a complex variety of other tumors also occurs. Recognition of such diverse tumor entities will allow accurate pathologic diagnosis and most optimal clinical management.",cancer
"Diagnostic challenges in the pathologic evaluation of Barrett esophagus. CONTEXT: Barrett esophagus represents an unstable epithelium resulting from chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease. Patients with Barrett esophagus routinely undergo endoscopic examination to detect dysplasia and early carcinoma. Although appropriate classification of Barrett esophagus and neoplasia is usually straightforward, persistent esophageal inflammation may induce epithelial changes that mimic, or mask, dysplasia. Recent data also indicate that specific molecular changes occur in nondysplastic Barrett mucosa and herald the development of dysplasia and/or carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To describe problematic aspects of biopsy interpretation in tissue samples of the gastroesophageal junction and distal esophagus, including the diagnostic criteria for Barrett esophagus, the importance of the gastric cardia, and pitfalls to the diagnosis of dysplasia. Ancillary studies that have recently emerged as potential adjuncts to the evaluation of patients with Barrett esophagus will be briefly discussed. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive review of the relevant literature indexed in PubMed (National Library of Medicine) was performed. CONCLUSIONS: Barrett esophagus is currently defined as the presence of intestinal metaplasia in samples obtained from an endoscopically evident abnormality in the distal esophagus. Diagnosis and grading of dysplasia in mucosal biopsies remain the most reliable method to assess risk for neoplastic progression, but its classification may be hindered by superimposed inflammatory changes and suffers from considerable interobserver variability. Therefore, immunohistochemical studies and molecular assessment for TP53, CDKN2A , and DNA content abnormalities have emerged as potential adjuncts to the detection of dysplasia.",cancer
"Severe valvular toxicity and pericarditis early after radiation therapy in a patient treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Hodgkin's disease can be cured in most cases by radiotherapy. However, it can increase the risk of cardiotoxicity. Here, we report a patient with Hodgkin's disease and superior vena cava syndrome who was treated with chemotherapy in combination with radiotherapy. Four months after the initiation of this therapy, she developed progressive dyspnea. Pleural and pericardial effusion, severe mitral regurgitation, moderate aortic insufficiency, and mild tricuspid regurgitation were detected in echocardiography, which suggested heart failure. The patient was then treated with intrapericardial drainage and received dopamine and diuretics for congestive heart failure; she responded well to this treatment and was discharged in good condition. After high-dose mediastinal radiation, cardiologic screening is recommended in order to identify patients with radiation-induced heart disease and to assess their need for treatment and follow-up.",cancer

"Childhood non-Hodgkin's lymphoma arising as a complication early in the course of Crohn's disease. The neoplastic change in patients with Crohn's disease is usually seen in the form of adenocarcinoma. Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma complicating chronic inflammatory bowel diseases is thought to be uncommon. This report describes a case of gastrointestinal lymphoma in a 12-year-old boy with Crohn's disease of one-year duration that initially manifested as an abdominal mass. Although Crohn's disease may present as a palpable abdominal mass, changing symptomatology should always warrant consideration of developing lymphoma complicating inflammatory bowel diseases. It is our hope that this case report gives the clinician an insight into the possibility of lymphoma development, even in the early course of the disease, and stresses the importance of obtaining a reliable histological diagnosis whenever possible.",cancer
"Primary solitary fibrous tumor of the vulva: a case report. BACKGROUND: Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) of the female genital tract is an extremely rare neoplasm of mesenchymal origin. CASE: A case of primary SFT originated from the vulva of a 39-year-old woman. The tumor presented as a 10-cm, well-circumscribed lump and was composed of bland-looking cells admixed with thin and thick collagen fibers with the appearance of hemangiopericytoma. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were strongly positive for CD99 and vimentin, with focal positivity for CD34, and were negative for S100, SMA, desmin, ER, PR, etc. Microscopic evaluation and immunohistochemistry supported the diagnosis of a primary benign vulvar SFT. The patient remained well 10 months after excision. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first Chinese case of vulvar SFT in the English-language literature. SFT should be taken into consideration during the diagnostic process with spindle cell lesions of the vulva. The outcome of this tumor is based mostly on complete surgical resection.",cancer
"Pelvic tuberculosis mimicking ovarian malignancy: a case report. BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis is quite prevalent in developing countries, including India. In the female genital tract, the fallopian tube is the most common site involved by the disease. CASE: A woman presented with infertility, menstrual irregularities, an abdominal mass, abdominal pain and weight loss. She was previously operated on for left ovarian germ cell tumor. The clinical, radiologic and histopathologic examination helped to reach the correct diagnosis. CONCLUSION: In a woman with a history of infertility, menstrual irregularities, an abdominal mass and weight loss, differentiation between malignancy and tuberculosis becomes difficult. These two possibilities should always be part of the differential diagnosis.",cancer
"Sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix successfully treated by laparoscopic radical hysterectomy: a case report. BACKGROUND: Sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix is a rare tumor with uncertain pathogenesis. The rarity of this neoplasm makes it difficult to diagnose and manage, and it seems to be an aggressive tumor with a short disease-free survival. To date, < 20 cases have been reported. We report the first case of sarcomatoid carcinoma successfully treated by laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. CASE: A 26-year-old woman presented with postcoital spotting. Gynecologic examination revealed an approximately 2.5-cm-diameter mass on the posterior lip of the cervix, and biopsy revealed a sarcomatoid carcinoma. After the baseline study for cervical cancer, the patient was found to have International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stage IB1 disease. The patient underwent laparoscopic radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Histopathologic examination showed no evidence of parametrial tumor extension or lymph node metastasis, and no adjuvant treatment was given. CONCLUSION: This report entails the first description of laparoscopic surgery for sarcomatoid carcinoma of the cervix. Despite short-term follow-up, it seems that early-stage disease could be successfully treated by laparoscopic radical hysterectomy.",cancer
"Metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia complicated by tumor lysis syndrome, heart failure, and thyrotoxicosis: a case report. BACKGROUND: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an extremely rare complication of solid tumors and is more frequently observed in patients with hematologic malignancies. This report describes a novel approach to the management of a rare case of TLS in metastatic gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). CASE: A 17-year-old female presented 8 weeks postpartum with severe anemia, thyrotoxicosis, and elevated serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG). Imaging studies confirmed metastatic GTN to the lungs. The patient developed grade 4 TLS after the first cycle of etoposide, methotrexate, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine (EMA-CO). She did not respond to standard treatment of aggressive hydration and allupurinol and continued to be in renal failure with elevated uric acid. A single dose of recombinant urate oxidase, rasburicase, rendered the uric acid level undetectable in 3 days and completely reversed the renal failure, avoiding hemodialysis. Three more cycles of EMA-CO were then administered. Subsequently, the patient developed congestive heart failure and was switched to single-agent actinomycin-D. Beta-hCG became negative after 5 cycles, and her ejection fraction returned to baseline. CONCLUSION: This is a rare case of TLS in the setting of metastatic GTN. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of utilizing rasburicase for the management of TLS in GTN.",cancer
Postpartum hemorrhage from ruptured Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor: a case report. BACKGROUND: Spontaneous postpartum rupture of a Sertoli-Leydig cell ovarian tumor is an infrequent complication of a rare tumor. CASE: A 21-year-old nullipara with an uneventful prenatal course and spontaneous vaginal delivery experienced severe intraabdominal bleeding with hypovolemic shock postpartum from the rupture of a previously undiagnosed Sertoli-Leydig cell ovarian tumor. Diagnosis and intervention were delayed because of the late development of overt signs of intraabdominal bleeding and misleading findings on abdominal examination. Vigorous uterine compression may have precipitated the bleeding. Emergency exploration and surgical intervention were successfully undertaken. Full staging of the cancer was not possible at the initial surgery because of the patient's cardiovascular instability. CONCLUSION: Rupture of a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor is a potential cause of postpartum hypovolemic shock resulting from massive intraabdominal bleeding.,cancer
"Periaortic pancreatic rests: a case report. BACKGROUND: Ectopic pancreatic tissue is a rare congenital anomaly and usually presents along the gastrointestinal tract. If not recognized, it can be confused histologically with an adenocarcinoma. CASE: We report a case arising in periaortic adipose tissue, found incidentally in a woman undergoing periaortic lymphadenectomy for recurrent ovarian carcinoma. CONCLUSION: We found no other reports of this lesion in periaortic tissue. Clinicians and pathologists need to be aware of this entity, which may rarely be encountered.",cancer
"Attitudes toward fertility preservation in female cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: To survey patient attitudes toward fertility preservation techniques in the case of infertility from cancer treatment. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey on adolescent cancer patients (ACPs) aged 15-21 years and their parents, as well as on breast cancer patients (BCPs). RESULTS: A total of 69% of ACPs were aware of the problem of infertility. However, only 31% recalled being spoken to about treatment effects on fertility. Parents were significantly more likely to have been spoken to (58% vs. 31%, p < 0.022) and tended to be more interested in fertility preservation. The groups were in agreement that cancer therapy should not be delayed. Of the BCPs, 67% expressed substantial concern regarding infertility. They were more likely to have been spoken to and tended to be younger and nulliparous, although statistical significance was not reached. Again, most were unwilling to delay therapy. CONCLUSION: There is an interest infertility preservation amongst our patients, but the medical information received may influence, to a certain extent, the attitudes of the patients. Greater emphasis should therefore be placed on counseling the patient during the treatment planning process.",cancer
"Granular cell myoblastoma of the tongue in a 2-year-old girl: a case report. Granular cell tumours are uncommon lesions, although the head and neck region accounts for approximately 50% of all lesions. It is not clear whether or not granular cell tumour is a true neoplasm, a developmental anomaly, or a trauma-induced proliferation. The basic cell of origin is now thought to be neural, although past reports frequently indicated an origin from striated muscle, or less frequently an origin from histiocytes, fibroblasts or pericytes. The tongue and the buccal mucosa are common intraoral sites. The other head and neck site likely to be involved is the larynx. The tumour generally occurs in middle or older aged adults. More than a third of all granular cell tumours occur on the lingual dorsum, usually as a sessile, painless, somewhat firm, immoveable nodule less than 1.5 cm in greatest diameter. Lesions often demonstrate a pallor or a yellowish discolouration and typically have a smooth surface. Histochemical and ultrastructural studies propose the origin of the lesion from Schwann cells, striated muscle, mesenchymal cells, histiocytes and epithelial cells. As most of the granular cell tumours are benign, surgical excision of the lesion is the treatment of choice.",cancer
"Mortality among U.S. astronauts: 1980-2009. INTRODUCTION: It has been nearly 20 yr since the first published astronaut mortality analysis. Using astronaut vital data and general population mortality rates, we calculate Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMR) for both total and specific causes of death among astronauts between January 1980 and June 2009 to look for changes in mortality patterns over time. METHODS: Astronaut vital data were derived from the Johnson Space Center website and the Astronaut Fact Book. General population mortality rates were taken from the Human Mortality Database and the Centers for Disease Control. SMR were computed as the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths using indirect standardization to several comparison populations. RESULTS: All SMR declined from the 1980s to the 2000s, though astronauts are still at increased risk of accidental death (SMR = 574, 95% C.I. 335-919). Astronauts are at greatly reduced risk of death by cardiovascular disease (SMR = 27, 95% C.I. 9-63) and cancer (SMR = 47, 95% C.I. 19-97), and astronauts are now at decreased risk of all-cause mortality compared with the general population. DISCUSSION: The SMR show that mortality from circulatory disease, cancer, and accidents have all declined from previous estimates, though astronauts are still at increased risk of accidental death. Improvements in circulatory disease mortality are likely due to intensive health screening and physical fitness within the Astronaut Corps. Similarly, physical fitness may be contributing to the reduction in cancer mortality. Fewer airplane crashes have contributed to the decreased risk of fatal accidents, which in turn is driving the reduction in all-cause mortality risk.",cancer
"Anterolateral thigh free flap for complex composite central chest wall defect reconstruction with extrathoracic microvascular anastomoses. BACKGROUND: Complex central chest wall resection defects present a challenging management problem for both thoracic and reconstructive surgeons. Although most chest wall defects can be repaired using local and regional flaps, more complicated cases require increasingly sophisticated techniques such as microsurgical free tissue transfer. This study reviews a single plastic surgeon's experience over a 4-year period with complex chest wall reconstruction using the anterolateral thigh free flap. METHODS: Five female patients who underwent the above procedure between 2004 and 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. The clinicopathologic details recorded included histologic diagnosis, extent of resection, type of skeletal defect, flap size, receipt vessels, ischemia time, and flap/donor-site complications. Skeletal reconstruction used methylmethacrylate/polypropylene mesh sandwich prostheses. RESULTS: The indications for surgery were metastatic breast cancer (n=3), advanced primary fibrosarcoma (n=1), and extensive radionecrosis (n=1). The average surface area of the chest wall resection was 197 cm (range, 156 to 270 cm). The four patients who underwent partial sternectomy and rib resection required skeletal reconstruction and subsequent ventilatory support postoperatively in the intensive care unit. The mean anterolateral thigh flap size was 188 cm (range, 143 to 252 cm); none of the donor sites was skin grafted. There was 100 percent flap survival, and the prostheses remained fully covered in all cases after a mean follow-up of 16 months (range, 5 to 28 months). No major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: The anterolateral thigh free flap is a safe and reliable option for reconstructing complicated composite chest wall defects. It therefore provides a practical alternative when regional pedicled flap options are unavailable or inadequate.",cancer
"One versus two venous anastomoses in microvascular free flap surgery. BACKGROUND: The authors' goal was to determine whether one or two venous anastomoses results in superior blood flow through microvascular free flaps. METHODS: During flap harvest, blood velocity was measured in each of two venae comitantes using Doppler ultrasonography. Next, one of the two veins was occluded with a microvascular clamp and blood velocity was measured in the open vein. The clamp was then removed and placed on the other vein, and blood velocity was measured in the first vein. The pedicle was divided and microvascular anastomosis of either one or two veins was performed. Venous blood velocity was then compared between flaps with one versus two venous anastomoses. RESULTS: Eighty-one free flaps were performed. Before pedicle division, the peak venous blood velocity in each of the two venae comitantes averaged 6.3+/-4.8 cm/second. When one of the veins was occluded, the peak venous blood velocity increased to 19.5+/-17.3 cm/second (p<0.00001). One venous anastomosis was performed in 69 flaps and two venous anastomoses were performed in 12 flaps. The mean blood velocity in flaps in which one venous anastomosis was performed was greater than the mean blood velocity in either vein when two venous anastomoses were performed (13.1+/-7.3 cm/second versus 7.5+/-4.3 cm/second, respectively; p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: When one vena comitans is occluded, blood velocity in the second vena comitans increases significantly. Venous blood velocity is significantly greater after a single venous anastomosis than in either of two veins when two venous anastomoses are performed. These results argue against routinely performing two venous anastomoses.",cancer
"Indications and outcomes for mandibular reconstruction using sequential bilateral fibula flaps. BACKGROUND: A subset of patients with recurrent or second intraoral tumors undergo both primary and secondary mandibular reconstruction using bilateral fibula flaps. The objective of this report is to describe indications and outcomes for these patients. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database was performed. Charts were reviewed to identify demographics, operative features, and functional outcomes. RESULTS: Ten patients underwent mandibular reconstruction with a second fibula flap for recurrent or second oral tumors. Time between flaps averaged 20 months. Bone gap size measured 8 cm after both resections. Eighty percent of secondary resections included the mandibular arch, in contrast to 20 percent of primary resections (p=0.070). Compared with primary resections, secondary soft-tissue defects were larger and more frequently included composite tissues. There were low complication rates and no flap failures after both reconstructions. Functional evaluation showed a greater dependency on supplemental enteral nutrition after the second resection (p=0.033). Five patients died at a median of 12.5 months after the second resection and the remaining patients have survived for a median of 18.6 months. CONCLUSIONS: The principal indication for second fibula flaps in mandibular reconstruction is central segment defects where rigid support is required to prevent sequelae of the Andy Gump deformity. For lateral resections, the large soft-tissue deficits of secondary extirpation may be better served by reconstruction with soft-tissue flaps. Second osseous free flaps can be performed safely, but with a significant decline in postoperative oropharyngeal function. Goals of surgery and quality of life need to be addressed before ablation of recurrent or second oral tumors is performed.",cancer

A striking overlap is observed in the tyrosine and L-dopa biosynthetic pathways suggesting a common disease mechanism associated with these 2 heterogeneous disorders that warrants further investigation.",cancer
"Autocrine TGF-beta and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) signaling drives the evolution of tumor-promoting mammary stromal myofibroblasts. Much interest is currently focused on the emerging role of tumor-stroma interactions essential for supporting tumor progression. Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), frequently present in the stroma of human breast carcinomas, include a large number of myofibroblasts, a hallmark of activated fibroblasts. These fibroblasts have an ability to substantially promote tumorigenesis. However, the precise cellular origins of CAFs and the molecular mechanisms by which these cells evolve into tumor-promoting myofibroblasts remain unclear. Using a coimplantation breast tumor xenograft model, we show that resident human mammary fibroblasts progressively convert into CAF myofibroblasts during the course of tumor progression. These cells increasingly acquire two autocrine signaling loops, mediated by TGF-beta and SDF-1 cytokines, which both act in autostimulatory and cross-communicating fashions. These autocrine-signaling loops initiate and maintain the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and the concurrent tumor-promoting phenotype. Collectively, these findings indicate that the establishment of the self-sustaining TGF-beta and SDF-1 autocrine signaling gives rise to tumor-promoting CAF myofibroblasts during tumor progression. This autocrine-signaling mechanism may prove to be an attractive therapeutic target to block the evolution of tumor-promoting CAFs.",cancer
"Small molecule inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding to pleckstrin homology domains. The PI3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates many cellular processes, especially cell metabolism, cell survival, and apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), the product of PI3K activity and a key signaling molecule, acts by recruiting pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain-containing proteins to cell membranes. Here, we describe a new structural class of nonphosphoinositide small molecule antagonists (PITenins, PITs) of PIP3-PH domain interactions (IC(50) ranges from 13.4 to 31 muM in PIP3/Akt PH domain binding assay). PITs inhibit interactions of a number of PIP3-binding PH domains, including those of Akt and PDK1, without affecting several PIP2-selective PH domains. As a result, PITs suppress the PI3K-PDK1-Akt pathway and trigger metabolic stress and apoptosis. A PIT-1 analog displayed significant antitumor activity in vivo, including inhibition of tumor growth and induction of apoptosis. Overall, our studies demonstrate the feasibility of developing specific small molecule antagonists of PIP3 signaling.",cancer
"Chemoprevention by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs eliminates oncogenic intestinal stem cells via SMAC-dependent apoptosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as sulindac effectively prevent colon cancer in humans and rodent models. However, their cellular targets and underlying mechanisms have remained elusive. We found that dietary sulindac induced apoptosis to remove the intestinal stem cells with nuclear or phosphorylated beta-catenin in APC(Min/+) mice. NSAIDs also induced apoptosis in human colonic polyps and effectively removed cells with aberrant Wnt signaling. Furthermore, deficiency in SMAC, a mitochondrial apoptogenic protein, attenuated the tumor-suppressive effect of sulindac in APC(Min/+) mice by blocking apoptosis and removal of stem cells with nuclear or phosphorylated beta-catenin. These results suggest that effective chemoprevention of colon cancer by NSAIDs lies in the elimination of stem cells that are inappropriately activated by oncogenic events through induction of apoptosis.",cancer
"Testis-specific protein on Y chromosome (TSPY) represses the activity of the androgen receptor in androgen-dependent testicular germ-cell tumors. Testis-specific protein on Y chromosome (TSPY) is an ampliconic gene on the Y chromosome, and genetic interaction with gonadoblastoma has been clinically established. However, the function of the TSPY protein remains to be characterized in physiological and pathological settings. In the present study, we observed coexpression of TSPY and the androgen receptor (AR) in testicular germ-cell tumors (TGCTs) in patients as well as in model cell lines, but such coexpression was not seen in normal testis of humans or mice. TSPY was a repressor for androgen signaling because of its trapping of cytosolic AR even in the presence of androgen. Androgen treatment stimulated cell proliferation of a TGCT model cell line, and TSPY potently attenuated androgen-dependent cell growth. Together with the finding that TSPY expression is reduced in more malignant TGCTs in vivo, the present study suggests that TSPY serves as a repressor in androgen-induced tumor development in TGCTs and raises the possibility that TSPY could be used as a clinical marker to assess the malignancy of TGCTs.",cancer
"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and apoA-I mimetic peptides inhibit tumor development in a mouse model of ovarian cancer. We examined whether reduced levels of Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in ovarian cancer patients are causal in ovarian cancer in a mouse model. Mice expressing a human apoA-I transgene had (i) increased survival (P < 0.0001) and (ii) decreased tumor development (P < 0.01), when compared with littermates, following injection of mouse ovarian epithelial papillary serous adenocarcinoma cells (ID-8 cells). ApoA-I mimetic peptides reduced viability and proliferation of ID8 cells and cis-platinum-resistant human ovarian cancer cells, and decreased ID-8 cell-mediated tumor burden in C57BL/6J mice when administered subcutaneously or orally. Serum levels of lysophosphatidic acid, a well-characterized modulator of tumor cell proliferation, were significantly reduced (>50% compared with control mice, P < 0.05) in mice that received apoA-I mimetic peptides (administered either subcutaneously or orally), suggesting that binding and removal of lysophosphatidic acid is a potential mechanism for the inhibition of tumor development by apoA-I mimetic peptides, which may serve as a previously unexplored class of anticancer agents.",cancer
"Narrative review: BRAF opens the door for therapeutic advances in melanoma. Patients with metastatic melanoma have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. In about one half of analyzed patients with metastatic melanoma, a mutated signal transduction molecule has been identified: v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF). This molecule is part of an intracellular signaling cascade and may play a role in many different types of cancer. This article provides an overview of the current treatment options for metastatic melanoma and describes the pathophysiology underlying the development of therapies based on inhibition of BRAF. It summarizes findings of phase 1 and phase 2 studies of BRAF inhibitor therapy primarily in patients with metastatic melanoma, who have shown objective response rates of 70% to 80%. However, initial responses have not been sustained, with a median time to relapse of approximately 9 months. Clinicians should be aware of phase 3 trials of these agents and trials combining these therapies with other novel therapies because, at a minimum, BRAF inhibitors seem to be valuable as palliative therapy for metastatic melanoma.",cancer
"An official American Thoracic Society systematic review: insurance status and disparities in lung cancer practices and outcomes. RATIONALE: Insurance coverage is an important determinant of access to care and is one potential cause of disparities in lung cancer care outcomes. OBJECTIVES: We performed a systematic review of the available literature to examine the association between insurance status and lung cancer practices and outcomes. METHODS: We searched multiple electronic databases through November 6, 2008 for studies that examined the association between lung cancer outcomes and insurance status. Two reviewers independently selected studies. One investigator evaluated their quality according to predetermined criteria, and abstracted data about study design, patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, and outcome measures. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 3,798 potentially relevant studies, 23 met eligibility criteria and were included. Studies reported heterogeneous outcomes among heterogeneous samples of patients that precluded a quantitative synthesis. In general, compared with patients with private or Medicare insurance, patients with Medicaid or no insurance had poorer lung cancer outcomes, including higher incidence rates, later stage at diagnosis, and poorer survival. Overall, patients with Medicaid or no insurance were less likely to undergo curative procedures, but patients without insurance were more likely to receive guideline-concordant care. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Medicaid or no insurance consistently had worse outcomes than other patients with lung cancer. Some of the disparities may be secondary to residual confounding from smoking and other health behaviors, but available data suggest that patients with lung cancer without insurance do poorly because access to care is limited and/or they present with more advanced disease that is less amenable to treatment.",cancer
"Conservative treatment of early endometrial cancer: preliminary results of a pilot study. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of combined operative hysteroscopy (HSC) and hormone therapy as fertility-preserving treatment in a cohort of selected young women with early endometrial carcinoma (EC). METHODS: Fourteen patients (median age 38 years, range 26-40) with FIGO stage IA (intramucous) EC wishing to preserve fertility were enrolled with the following inclusion criteria: age </=40 years; no evidence of Lynch II syndrome; well-differentiated estrogen/progesterone receptor positive (ER+/PR+) endometrioid EC; no evidence of myoinvasion, multifocal tumor, node metastasis, ovarian mass; normal serum CA 125. Treatment consisted of hysteroscopic ablation of the lesion and the myometrial tissue below, followed by oral megestrol acetate (MA) 160 mg/day for 6 months (6 pts) or 52 mg levonorgestrel-medicated intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) for 12 months (8 pts). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 40 months (range 13-79), one patient recurred after 5 months from operative HSC and underwent definitive surgery, one patient showed an endometrial hyperplasia without atypia at the 3 and 6 month HSC control, with negative controls thereafter. Three patients have attempted to conceive and one of them conceived and term delivered a healthy baby. CONCLUSIONS: Combined operative HSC and progestin therapy may have a role for safe and effective conservative management of early EC in selected patients wishing to preserve fertility.",cancer
"Identification of carbonic anhydrase 9 as a contributor to pingyangmycin-induced drug resistance in human tongue cancer cells. Drug resistance is the major obstacle to successful cancer treatment. To understand the mechanisms responsible for drug resistance in tongue cancer, Tca8113 cells derived from moderately differentiated human tongue squamous cell carcinoma were exposed to stepwise escalated concentrations of pingyangmycin (PYM) to develop the resistant cell line called Tca8113/PYM, which showed over 18.78-fold increased resistance to PYM as compared with Tca8113 cells, and cross-resistance to cisplatin, pirarubicin, paclitaxel, adriamycin, and mitomycin. We found that the resistance was not associated with multidrug resistance transporter 1 (p170, p-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 and breast cancer resistance protein overexpression, so we hypothesized that Tca8113/PYM cells must have some other resistance mechanism selected by PYM. To test this hypothesis, the global gene expression profiles between Tca8113 and Tca8113/PYM cells were compared by cDNA microarray. Eighty-nine genes and thirteen expressed sequence tags with differential expression levels between the two cell lines were identified. Some differential expression levels were validated with real-time PCR and western blot. Furthermore, the functional validation showed that both carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor acetazolamide application and CA9 silencing with CA9 antisense oligonucleotides contribute to the medium pH increase of Tca8113/PYM cells and enhanced PYM chemosensitivity. Moreover, both acetazolamide and CA9 antisense oligonucleotides significantly increased PYM-induced caspase 3 activation in Tca8113/PYM cells. Thus, our study suggests that the resistance of Tca8113/PYM cells is probably associated with CA9 and other differential expression molecules, and that CA9 may be an important marker for prediction of PYM responsiveness in tongue cancer chemotherapy.",cancer
"Sorafenib efficacy in ovarian clear cell carcinoma revealed by transcriptome profiling. The purpose of this study was to investigate a new modality of therapy against ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC), a chemoresistant subtype of ovarian cancer. Microarray datasets of ovarian cancer cell lines and cancer tissues were analyzed using bioinformatic tools. The gene expression profile of OCCC was similar to that of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This similarity was at least partially due to hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 pathway activation common to both malignancies. In addition, oncogenic pathway alterations were characteristic of OCCC including hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha subunit and relatively high Ras activities. Therefore, we predicted that the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, which is approved for RCC and suppresses Ras activity, would also be effective against OCCC. Orally administered sorafenib (40 mg/kg per day) significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice when it was given after inoculation with the OCCC cell line RMG-2 (P = 0.002). Furthermore, sorafenib significantly reduced tumor size when it was administered to established RMG-2 tumors (P = 0.0002), while intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (5 mg/kg per week) did not. In conclusion, the prominent anti-tumor effect of sorafenib against OCCC indicates that sorafenib is a promising candidate drug and supports the need for clinical trials using sorafenib against OCCC. This report demonstrates a method to utilize genome-wide information to facilitate translational research for treatments against less common subtypes of cancers.",cancer
"Chromatin-bound PCNA as S-phase marker in mononuclear blood cells of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia or multiple myeloma. OBJECTIVES: Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) has often been used as a marker to aid assessment of tumour growth fraction. This paper addresses the question of whether it can be used as an S-phase marker, when the non-chromatin-bound form of the protein is removed by pepsin treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytofluorometric measurements were carried out after immunofluorescence staining of PCNA and counterstaining of DNA. S-phase fraction was determined with the help of windows on PCNA versus DNA scattergrams, or mathematically from DNA histograms. RESULTS: S-phase fractions obtained using the two methods correlated well, but did not always agree, exact discrepancies depending on the mathematical model used for histogram analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Determination of S-phase fractions with the help of PCNA immunofluorescence staining is possible, and probably more reliable than calculation of S-fractions from DNA histograms. It thus offers an alternative to assays involving BrdU labelling in vivo.",cancer
"Coupled mathematical model of tumorigenesis and angiogenesis in vascular tumours. OBJECTIVES: Mathematical models are useful for studying vascular and avascular tumours, because these allow for more logical experimental design and provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of their growth and development. The processes of avascular tumour growth and the development of capillary networks through tumour-induced angiogenesis have already been extensively investigated, albeit separately. Despite the clinical significance of vascular tumours, few studies have combined these approaches to develop a single comprehensive growth and development model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We develop a continuum-based mathematical model of vascular tumour growth. In the model, angiogenesis is initiated through the release of angiogenic growth factors (AGFs) by cells in the hypoxic regions of the tumour. The nutrient concentration within the tumour reflects the influence of capillary growth and invasion induced by AGF. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Parametric and sensitivity studies were performed to evaluate the influence of different model parameters on tumour growth and to identify the parameters with the most influence, which include the rates of proliferation, apoptosis and necrosis, as well as the diffusion of sprout tips and the size of the region affected by angiogenesis. An optimization was performed for values of the model parameters that resulted in the best agreement with published experimental data. The resulting model solution matched the experimental data with a high degree of correlation (r = 0.85).",cancer
"Ectosomes as modulators of inflammation and immunity. Vesicles released by cells have been described using various names, including exosomes, microparticles, microvesicles and ectosomes. Here we propose to differentiate clearly between ectosomes and exosomes according to their formation and release. Whereas exosomes are formed in multi-vesicular bodies, ectosomes are vesicles budding directly from the cell surface. Depending upon the proteins expressed, exosomes activate or inhibit the immune system. One of the major properties of exosomes released by antigen-presenting cells is to induce antigen-specific T cell activation. Thus, they have been used for tumour immunotherapy. By contrast, the major characteristics of ectosomes released by various cells, including tumour cells, polymorphonuclear leucocytes and erythrocytes, are the expression of phosphatidylserine and to have anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive activities similarly to apoptotic cells.",cancer
"Perineurioma of the sciatic nerve: a possible cause of idiopathic foot drop in children: report of 4 cases. The authors report on a loss of foot dorsiflexion in pediatric-age individuals and suggest that the possible cause could be a perineurioma of the sciatic nerve. The authors describe 4 cases in which foot drop in the absence of sensory discomfort was the heralding sign of perineurioma of the sciatic nerve. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a focal enlargement of the sciatic nerve, but the tumor was confined only to its lateral compartment. Treatment in 2 cases involved excision of the affected segment and subsequent graft repair. The two other patients shared the same clinical, radiological, and surgical findings, but no nerve biopsy sample was obtained; the patients underwent only a tibialis posterior muscle transfer. Long-term recovery of nerve function never occurred. Because tumor resection and nerve graft yield no functional results, a tendon transfer to restore walking may be the sole useful surgical procedure in these cases. Removal of the tumor may not be necessary because long-term follow-up confirms that perineuriomas are self-limiting and the final prognosis is favorable.",cancer
"Neuroendoscopic treatment of arachnoid cysts of the quadrigeminal cistern: a series of 14 cases. OBJECT: In this paper, the authors' goal was to evaluate the role of neuroendoscopy in the treatment of arachnoid cysts of the quadrigeminal cistern. METHODS: Between March 1995 and February 2008, 14 patients affected by arachnoid cysts of the quadrigeminal cistern were treated endoscopically. The cysts were classified according to their anatomical and radiological appearance. The most frequent form (Type I) extended infratentorially and supratentorially with a dumbbell shape. Type II cysts were confined to the infratentorial space and were associated with the most severe and acute form of hydrocephalus. Type III cysts presented a significant asymmetric expansion toward the temporal fossa. Ten patients underwent an endoscopic procedure as primary treatment and 4 as an alternative to shunt revision. In 6 cases, the first endoscopic procedure was ventriculocystostomy (VC) together with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). In the other 8 cases, the first endoscopic procedure was VC alone. RESULTS: In the 6 cases in which VC was performed with an ETV, the procedure was successful, and the patients did not require further surgery. Of the 8 cases in which the first endoscopic procedure performed was VC without ETV, 7 underwent reoperation. Four of these patients underwent endoscopic procedures (by reopening the obstructed VC and performing ETV or cystocisternostomy) 2, 4, 4, and 5 months later with final success in all cases. Three patients (all of whom were previously treated using ventriculo- or cystoperitoneal shunts) required shunt reimplantation (complete failure). Subdural collection developed in 1 case, which was managed by transient insertion of a subduroperitoneal shunt. Neurological and developmental outcomes were good except for 1 patient who did not show improvement in preoperative developmental delay. No transient or permanent morbidity or mortality was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of this series suggests that arachnoid cysts of the quadrigeminal cistern and the associated hydrocephalus can be effectively treated by endoscopy; this approach allows the patient to be shunt independent in more than 78% of the cases. If endoscopy is used as first option, the success rate of endoscopic procedures observed in this series was 90%. Endoscopic third ventriculostomy should be associated with a VC to offer the highest success rate with a single procedure.",cancer
"Suprasellar arachnoid cyst resulting in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is occasionally seen after hypothalamic injury or dysfunction, although it typically occurs in association with other endocrine disturbances. It is has never been described as a presenting feature of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst (SAC) in the pediatric population. The authors describe the case of an enlarging SAC resulting in SIADH as the only presenting feature, with an otherwise normal hypothalamic-pituitary axis. An SAC was diagnosed in utero in this 5-month-old girl who had a normal functioning hypothalamic-pituitary axis on presentation. Because of cyst enlargement and hydrocephalus, the patient was scheduled for surgery; however, preoperative labs revealed SIADH. After stabilizing the serum sodium concentration with fluid restriction and the administration of 3% sodium chloride, the patient underwent endoscopic cyst fenestration. Postoperatively, she had complete resolution of the SIADH. Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion as the presenting symptom of an SAC has not been previously described. In the aforementioned patient, the proposed mechanism for SIADH was enlargement of the suprasellar arachnoid cyst causing compression of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and thus overstimulating the secretion of arginine vasopressin, which resulted in SIADH. The association of SIADH with an SAC is reportable, as is the resolution of the SIADH via cyst fenestration. The authors suggest that SIADH is an uncommon presenting feature of SACs and that syndrome resolution is possible with cyst decompression.",cancer
"Analysis of therapeutic choices for slit ventricle syndrome after cyst-peritoneal shunting for temporal arachnoid cysts in children. OBJECT: The goal in this study was to investigate early diagnostic evidence, optimal therapeutic strategies, and prophylactic methods for slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) in patients with temporal lobe arachnoid cysts who received cyst-peritoneal (CP) shunts. METHODS: Six cases of SVS in patients with temporal lobe arachnoid cysts who received CP shunts were treated by the senior authors in 2 institutions between January 2005 and January 2009. The radiological data, treatment process, and therapeutic results were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: There were 4 boys and 2 girls, whose mean age at presentation was 4 years and 1 month. The main clinical symptoms were severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and decreasing eyesight. Radiological studies showed normal or slightly smaller than normal ventricles, and arachnoid cysts that had shrunk dramatically. The most effective treatment for SVS was to replace the original shunts with devices that had a programmable valve, or if this was unsuccessful, to replace the original shunts with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. All symptoms in these patients disappeared, and the mean follow-up duration was 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: The SVS presents more often in patients with hydrocephalus who undergo VP shunting. However, it is also a serious complication in patients with arachnoid cysts who receive a CP shunt. The SVS is not a single condition; rather, different pathophysiological conditions can underlie this complicated syndrome. Because there are no striking morphological changes on radiological studies of the SVS in the patients with CP shunts, it is not easy for this syndrome to be diagnosed in time and treated rationally. Misdiagnosis and delayed treatment usually occur. The use of programmable shunts or VP shunts to replace the original shunt is an optimal therapeutic choice. The use of low-pressure shunts to treat arachnoid cysts should be abandoned unless dictated by specific indications.",cancer
"Gamma Knife surgery for arteriovenous malformations in children. OBJECT: The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term imaging and clinical outcomes of intracranial arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in children treated with Gamma Knife surgery (GKS). METHODS: Between 1989 and 2007, 200 patients with AVMs who were 18 years of age or younger were treated at the University of Virginia Health System. Excluding 14 patients who had not reached 2-year follow-up, 186 patients comprised this study. Hemorrhage was the most common presenting symptom leading to the diagnosis of AVMs (71.5%). The mean nidus volume was 3.2 cm(3) at the time of GKS, and a mean prescription dose of 21.9 Gy was used. RESULTS: After initial GKS, 49.5% of patients achieved total angiographic obliteration. Forty-one patients whose AVM nidi remained patent underwent additional GKS. The obliteration rate increased to 58.6% after a second or multiple GKS. Subtotal obliteration was achieved in 9 patients (4.8%). Forty-nine patients (26.3%) still had a patent residual nidus. In 19 patients (10.2%), obliteration was confirmed on MR imaging only. Ten patients had 17 hemorrhages during the follow-up period. The hemorrhage rate was 5.4% within 2 years after GKS and 0.8% between 2 and 5 years. Six patients developed neurological deficits along with the radiation-induced changes. Two patients developed asymptomatic meningiomas 10 and 12 years after GKS. After a mean clinical follow-up of 98 months, less than 4% of patients had difficulty attending school or developing a career. CONCLUSIONS: Gamma Knife surgery offers a reasonable chance of obliteration of an AVM in pediatric patients. The incidence of symptomatic radiation-induced changes is relatively low; however, long-term clinical and imaging follow-up is required to identify delayed cyst formation and secondary tumors.",cancer
"Stereotactic radiosurgery for pediatric recurrent intracranial ependymomas. OBJECT: To evaluate the role of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with recurrent or residual intracranial ependymomas after resection and fractionated radiation therapy (RT), the authors assessed overall survival, distant tumor relapse, progression-free survival (PFS), and complications. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the records of 21 children with ependymomas who underwent SRS for 32 tumors. There were 17 boys and 4 girls with a median age of 6.9 years (range 2.9-17.2 years) in the patient population. All patients underwent resection of an ependymoma followed by cranial or neuraxis (if spinal metastases was confirmed) RT. Eleven patients had adjuvant chemotherapy. Twelve patients had low-grade ependymomas (17 tumors), and 9 patients had anaplastic ependymomas (15 tumors). The median radiosurgical target volume was 2.2 cm(3) (range 0.1-21.4 cm(3)), and the median dose to the tumor margin was 15 Gy (range 9-22 Gy). RESULTS: Follow-up imaging demonstrated therapeutic control in 23 (72%) of 32 tumors at a mean follow-up period of 27.6 months (range 6.1-72.8 months). Progression-free survival after the initial SRS was 78.4%, 55.5%, and 41.6% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Factors associated with a longer PFS included patients without spinal metastases (p = 0.033) and tumor volumes < 2.2 cm(3) (median tumor volume 2.2 cm(3), p = 0.029). An interval >/= 18 months between RT and SRS was also associated with longer survival (p = 0.035). The distant tumor relapse rate despite RT and SRS was 33.6%, 41.0%, and 80.3% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Factors associated with a higher rate of distant tumor relapse included patients who had spinal metastases before RT (p = 0.037), a fourth ventricle tumor location (p = 0.002), and an RT to SRS interval < 18 months (p = 0.015). The median survival after SRS was 27.6 months (95% CI 19.33-35.87 months). Overall survival after SRS was 85.2%, 53.2%, and 23.0% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Adverse radiation effects developed in 2 patients (9.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic radiosurgery offers an additional option beyond repeat surgery or RT in pediatric patients with residual or recurrent ependymomas after initial management. Patients with smaller-volume tumors and a later recurrence responded best to radiosurgery.",cancer
"Surgical management of giant pediatric craniopharyngiomas. OBJECT: Prior work by the authors' group and reports of other authors suggest worse functional outcomes and decreased survival in children with larger craniopharyngiomas. The purpose of this study was to assess the oncological, endocrinological, and functional outcomes in children who underwent radical resection of giant craniopharyngiomas (defined as 5 cm or greater in largest diameter). METHODS: Between 1986 and 2006, 26 children under the age of 18 (14 boys, 12 girls; mean age 10.5 years) underwent radical resection of giant craniopharyngiomas performed by the senior author. Data were retrospectively collected to assess the outcome of surgical treatment. RESULTS: Twenty (77%) of 26 patients underwent gross-total resection (GTR) confirmed by intraoperative inspection and postoperative imaging. All primary tumors (17 of 17) and 3 (33%) of 9 recurrent tumors were treated with GTR. There was no operative mortality, and 18 of 26 patients (69%) were alive at a mean follow-up of 8.9 years (median 9.3 years). Disease control was achieved in 21 (84%) of the 25 patients followed up for more than 6 months and was more successful in patients who underwent GTR (95%) than in those who underwent STR (50%, p = 0.03). New-onset diabetes insipidus (DI) occurred in 63.2% of patients (73% of patients had DI postoperatively). New or worsened deficits in visual acuity and visual fields occurred in 16% and 28%, respectively, of the 25 patients for whom postoperative visual data were available. Five patients (19%) experienced significant, permanent neurological deficits, and 5 (19%) had mild to moderate deficits. New or worsened hypothalamic disturbance occurred in 35% and 22% of patients, respectively, but obesity developed in only 15%. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective series, radical resection of giant craniopharyngiomas in children was found to lead to excellent rates of disease control with acceptable or good functional outcomes but slightly higher rates of neurological complications compared with rates in patients with smaller tumors. Radical resection is less successful in recurrent tumors that reach very large sizes, especially previously irradiated tumors, with resultant diminished survival.",cancer
"Preliminary proposal for surgical classification of sacral tumors. OBJECT: The authors propose a new surgical classification method for sacral tumors that improves the guidance for specific surgical decisions and approaches. METHODS: The authors retrospectively studied the clinical courses of 92 patients with sacral tumors treated at the Changhai Hospital; all patients underwent tumor resection between January 2000 and August 2005. The clinical characteristics, imaging features, and pathological classifications were carefully assessed in each case. The tumors were classified according to the imaging features and intraoperative findings. The surgical approach and the resection area were determined according to the tumor classification. RESULTS: The proposed surgical classification system divided the sacral tumors into 2 major types according to the lesion's anatomical position in the sagittal plane. The tumors were further divided into 4 subtypes according to the length of the tumor's anterior protrusion into the pelvic cavity. Finally, each tumor subtype was classified into 16 areas according to the anatomical position in the cross-sectional plane. This classification method was used to categorize the sacral tumors, all of which were totally resected under the naked eye. Postoperatively symptoms were improved to varying degrees. CONCLUSIONS: The appropriate classification of sacral tumors and the selection of a corresponding surgical approach can improve the rate of total resection and the surgical safety, as well as decrease the recurrence rate.",cancer
"Venous thromboembolism after spine surgery: changes of the fibrin monomer complex and D-dimer level during the perioperative period. OBJECT: The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after spine surgery. Another purpose was to clarify the rapid changes of the fibrin monomer complex (FMC) and D-dimer levels during the perioperative period of spine surgery for early diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). METHODS: The participants were 72 patients who underwent spine surgery between September 2007 and March 2008. The FMC and D-dimer levels were measured 6 times: 1) at induction of general anesthesia; 2) just after implantation or during surgery; 3) immediately following surgery; 4) 1 day after surgery; 5) 3 days postsurgery; and 6) 7 days after surgery. All patients received mechanical prophylaxis, including compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices, and all were examined with duplex ultrasonography assessments of both lower extremities and with lung perfusion scintigraphy 7-10 days after surgery. If DVT or PE was suspected, the patient underwent multidetector CT venography. RESULTS: There were no patients with clinical signs of DVT and PE, but 6 (8.3%) showed VTE, among whom 5 had DVT and 3 had PE. Patients with VTE had significantly higher FMC levels 1 day after surgery, compared with those without VTE (55.9 +/- 17.2 mug/ml vs 11.1 +/- 2.89 mug/ml; p < 0.01). Patients with VTE had significantly higher D-dimer levels 7 days postsurgery, compared with those without VTE (12.5 +/- 2.95 mug/ml vs 4.3 +/- 0.39 mug/ml; p < 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the FMC result was more useful than the D-dimer assay for diagnosis of VTE. When the cutoff value was set to 20.8 mug/ml for FMC, sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 86.3%. CONCLUSIONS: In this study the prevalence of VTE after spine surgery was 8.3%. The FMC measured 1 day after spine surgery is considered to be useful as an indicator of VTE.",cancer
"Extinction kinetics for metastatic cancer stem cells. PURPOSE: Cancer Stem Cells (CSC) are hypothesised to influence tumour growth through their self-replication, cell loss, and differentiation into growth-limited cell types. A model for the random gain and loss of metastatic CSC is developed to investigate how the balance between these processes might affect metastatic efficiency, tumour involution and treatment response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A stochastic birth-death model for metastasis was constructed for the replication and loss of CSC. The model was extended to account for single and sequential cancer treatments, with CSC repopulation. RESULTS: If CSC losses exceed gains, the metastasis would become extinct. The resultant extinction probability was greatest during a period of stochastic susceptibility; treatment could extend, or reestablish, this period. CONCLUSION: Random CSC losses, with 'seed and soil' selection, provided a mechanistic explanation for the involution of metastases, as well as for metastatic inefficiency. With such background losses, and the growth limitations of differentiated cells, a metastasis could take years to reach macroscopic size. The susceptibility period could be protracted, providing for a window for therapeutic opportunity. Metastases with a high background CSC loss would be more responsive to treatment than stabler metastases. Modulation of this loss could enhance the efficacy of conventional cancer treatment.",cancer
"Causal relationship between exposure to chemicals and malignant melanoma? A review and study proposal. Malignant melanoma (MM) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The MM-related incidence and mortality have been increasing at an alarming rate over at least the past four decades. Malignant melanoma has been thought to be related mainly to exposure to the sun or UV radiation. A review of the scientific literature reveals many significant correlations between chemical exposure in the workplace and the occurrence of malignant melanoma, particularly in cutaneous areas that have never been exposed to sunlight. Discrepant findings are reported by independent studies concluding that MM is causally related to employment-related chemical exposures and to investigators with industry affiliations. More studies are needed to define a correlation of chemical exposure as a co-factor on the pathogenesis in some melanoma patients. We propose further investigation by dermatologists working in Melanoma Centers, using a simple questionnaire on chemical exposure among patients, that have previously been diagnosed and are followed up for melanoma comparing with appropriate matched controls. Collecting the data and results from the questionnaire will help us understand the initiation events in melanoma and prevention health issues.",cancer
"Conjugation is essential for the anticholestatic effect of NorUrsodeoxycholic acid in taurolithocholic acid-induced cholestasis in rat liver. NorUDCA (24-norursodeoxycholic acid), the C(2)(3)-homolog of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), showed remarkable therapeutic effects in cholestatic Mdr2 (Abcb4) (multidrug resistance protein 2/ATP-binding cassette b4) knockout mice with sclerosing/fibrosing cholangitis. In contrast to UDCA, norUDCA is inefficiently conjugated in human and rodent liver, and conjugation has been discussed as a key step for the anticholestatic action of UDCA in cholestasis. We compared the choleretic, anticholestatic, and antiapoptotic properties of unconjugated and taurine-conjugated UDCA (C(2)(4)) and norUDCA (C(2)(3)) in isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) and in natrium/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp)-transfected human hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) was used to induce a predominantly hepatocellular cholestasis in IPRL. Bile flow was determined gravimetrically; bile acids determined by gas chromatography and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry; the Mrp2 model substrate, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (GS-DNP) was determined spectrophotometrically; and apoptosis was determined immunocytochemically. The choleretic effect of C(2)(3)-bile acids was comparable to their C(2)(4)-homologs in IPRL. In contrast, TnorUDCA, but not norUDCA antagonized the cholestatic effect of TLCA. Bile flow (percent of controls) was 8% with TLCA-induced cholestasis, and unchanged by coinfusion of norUDCA (14%). However, it was increased by TnorUDCA (83%), UDCA (73%) and TUDCA (136%). Secretion of GS-DNP was markedly reduced by TLCA (5%), unimproved by norUDCA (4%) or UDCA (17%), but was improved modestly by TnorUDCA (26%) or TUDCA (58%). No apoptosis was observed in IPRL exposed to low micromolar TLCA, but equivalent antiapoptotic effects of TUDCA and TnorUDCA were observed in Ntcp-HepG2 cells exposed to TLCA. CONCLUSION: Conjugation is essential for the anticholestatic effect of norUDCA in a model of hepatocellular cholestasis. Combined therapy with UDCA and norUDCA may be superior to UDCA or norUDCA monotherapy in biliary disorders in which hepatocyte as well as cholangiocyte dysfunction contribute to disease progression.",cancer
"Radioembolization with yttrium-90 glass microspheres in hepatocellular carcinoma: European experience on safety and long-term survival. Radioembolization has been demonstrated to allow locoregional therapy of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma not eligible for transarterial chemoembolization or other local therapies. The aim of this study was to validate evidence of the safety and efficacy of this treatment in a European sample of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Therefore, 108 consecutive patients with advanced HCC and liver cirrhosis were included. Yttrium-90 (Y-90) microspheres were administered in a lobar fashion over the right or left branch of the hepatic artery. The response to treatment was evaluated by computed tomography (CT) imaging applying Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and World Health Organization (WHO) criteria with recent European Association for the Study of the Liver / National Cancer Institute (EASL/NCI) amendments. Time to progression (TTP) and overall survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. In all, 159 treatment sessions were performed ranging between one to three treatments per patient. The mean radiation dose per treatment was 120 (+/- 18) Gy. According to EASL criteria, complete responses were determined in 3% of patients, partial responses in 37%, stable disease 53%, and primary progression in 6% of patients. TTP was 10.0 months, whereas the median overall survival was 16.4 months. No lung or visceral toxicity was observed. The most frequently observed adverse events was a transient fatigue-syndrome. CONCLUSION: Radioembolization with Y-90 glass microspheres for patients with advanced HCC is a safe and effective treatment which can be utilized even in patients with compromised liver function. Because TTP and survival appear to be comparable to systemic therapy in selected patients with advanced HCC, randomized controlled trials in combination with systemic therapy are warranted.",cancer
"A novel GSK-3 beta-C/EBP alpha-miR-122-insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor regulatory circuitry in human hepatocellular carcinoma. miR-122 is a highly abundant, hepatocyte-specific microRNA. The biomedical significance and regulatory mechanisms of miR-122 remain obscure. We explored the role of miR-122 in tumorigenesis in the context of gene regulatory network. The miR-122 promoter and its transactivator were identified by way of luciferase reporter system, electrophoretic mobility shift, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The miR-122 regulatory circuitry and its implication in hepatocarcinogenesis were identified using livers of different development stages, human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines, and aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1))-transformed cells. We characterized the -5.3 to -4.8 kb region upstream of miR-122 precursor as miR-122 promoter. Further investigation revealed that deletion of predicted CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha) binding sites C/EBPalpha knockdown significantly reduced miR-122 promoter activity and endogenous miR-122 expression; and C/EBPalpha directly interacted with the miR-122 promoter in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that C/EBPalpha is a transactivator for miR-122 transcription. We further demonstrated that miR-122 suppressed insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) translation and sustained glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3beta) activity. The activated GSK-3beta not only repressed cell proliferation, but also activated C/EBPalpha, which maintained miR-122 levels and thereby enforced IGF-1R suppression. Interestingly, down-regulation of miR-122 and C/EBPalpha, and up-regulation of IGF-1R were frequently observed in HCC tissues, and decreased miR-122 levels were associated with worse survival of HCC patients. Moreover, AFB(1) exposure resulted in decreased activity in GSK-3beta, C/EBPalpha, and miR-122 and increased levels of IGF-1R, whereas restoration of miR-122 suppressed the tumorigenicity of HCC and AFB(1)-transformed cells. CONCLUSION: We have identified a novel GSK-3beta-C/EBPalpha-miR-122-IGF-1R regulatory circuitry whose dysfunction may contribute to the development of HCC. Our findings provide new insight into miR-122's function and the mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis.",cancer
"Metastatic cutaneous melanoma presented with ileal invagination: report of a case. We herein report a case of ileal invagination secondary to metastasis of a cutaneous melanoma. A 45-year-old female was admitted with intermittent abdominal pain and nausea. The patient's medical history was remarkable for cutaneous malignant melanoma. Imaging studies showed a solid mass in the right lower quadrant and the possibility of invagination. We made a preoperative diagnosis of partial intestinal obstruction, and laparotomy was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed ileal invagination. Segmental ileum resection with wide mesenteric lymph node dissection was performed. A polypoid metastasis of melanoma into the lumen of the ileum was confirmed with pathological examination. The diagnosis and management of intestinal metastasis of cutaneous malignant melanoma are discussed together with a literature review.",cancer
"The role of computerized tomography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis in patients with negative ultrasonography findings and a low Alvarado score. BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify the role of computerized tomography (CT) in the differential diagnosis of acute appendicitis in patients with a low Alvarado score and negative ultrasonography findings. METHODS: Fifty-two cases who underwent appendectomy (December 2004-September 2008) were included. All patients had an Alvarado score of 4-6 together with negative ultrasonography findings; preoperative abdominal CT examination results were available in all patients. CT results were compared with intraoperative and pathological findings. RESULTS: The mean age of the cases was 31+/-4 years (range 11 to 71 years). The mean Alvarado score was 4.9. CT results were in favor of acute appendicitis in 34 of 52 cases. Of these 34 patients, acute appendicitis was confirmed by pathological findings in 31, whereas acute appendicitis could not be confirmed in the remaining three cases (8.2%). In 15 of 18 cases without CT findings of appendicitis, intraoperative and pathological findings were also in agreement; however, the remaining three cases had acute appendicitis. Based on the results of the recent studies, sensitivity and specificity of CT in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were 91.2% and 83.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To avoid unnecessary appendectomies in suspected acute appendicitis cases with a low Alvarado score and negative ultrasonography findings, CT may be used as a complementary diagnostic tool.",cancer
"Chemotherapy in severe nasal polyposis--a possible beneficial effect? A report of three cases. BACKGROUND: Nasal polyposis is an inflammatory process of the nasal mucosa. Treatment has changed from surgery to an anti-inflammatory approach, but neither of these treatments addresses the underlying cause. Topical steroids and occasional use of systemic steroids in patients with nasal polyposis can frequently control the polypoid disease. In a few cases, when the disease is more aggressive, the repeated application of systemic steroids together with sinus surgery is required. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present our experience with one case of rheumatoid arthritis and two cases with malignant diseases, all of which were treated with chemotherapy and were also accompanied by severe nasal polyposis. All of our patients had eosinophilic polypoid disease. Various chemotherapeutic treatment schemes were utilized. RESULTS: During chemotherapy all three patients were markedly improved symptomatically including olfaction along with a significant reduction in their nasal polyposis. Duration of remission lasted for a few months in two cases and for three years, in a third case. CONCLUSION: This is the first report describing the successful treatment of severe nasal polyposis with chemotherapy. Based on this experience, we suggest a phase II trial with chemotherapy, preferably ""low dose"" methotrexate, in patients with severe nasal polyposis.",cancer
"Endoscopic management of inverted papillomas: long-term results--the St. Paul's Sinus Centre experience. OBJECTIVES: To demonstrate that computer-assisted endoscopic management of inverted papillomas yields excellent long-term results in terms of preventing recurrence and minimizing significant morbidity and mortality. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who are being followed up for tumour recurrence or have undergone tumour removal between 2000 and 2008. All cases were undertaken using the GE Instatrak 3500+ navigation system. RESULTS: Inverted papillomas are the most common tumour managed endoscopically (57% of all sinonasal tumours) with 76 patients seen over the last 8 years. Approximately 50% of these cases had undergone previous surgery in another centre where the tumour was either not recognized or the resection was incomplete. Twentynine percent of these patients had a recurrence but only three required a revision procedure using an open approach; otherwise recurrences were successfully managed endoscopically. Endoscopic recurrence during the first half was 32% (versus 14% for open procedures), dropping to a recurrence rate of 11% in the latter period. CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic management of inverted papillomas allows good control of the disease and avoids unnecessary morbidity associated with open procedures. Although there is a higher initial recurrence rate, these recurrences can be successfully managed endoscopically, and computer navigation can be a useful adjunct in achieving this.",cancer
"Expression of cathepsin S and its inhibitor stefin A in sinonasal inverted papilloma. BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of cysteinyl cathepsins and their inhibitors, cystatins (stefins), were implied in progression of tumorgenesis; nevertheless, their role in sinonasal inverted papilloma (IP) is still unrecognized. METHODS: The differential expression of cathepsins and stefins in IP and normal tissues were revealed by data of human Affymetrix U133A gene chips, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Among the cathepsins and stefins family, expression of cathepsin S and stefin A were most differentially expressed (down- and up-regulated, respectively) in IP tissue as compared with normal tissues. Their expression levels were validated by real-time PCR, which showed the expression level of cathepsin S was significantly down-regulated, whereas the expression of stefin A was significantly up-regulated in IP tissue compared to normal sinus mucosa. Using immunohistochemistry, expression of cathepsin S was observed in stromal and epithelial area macrophages of normal sinus mucosa, but no obvious expression of cathepsin S was found in IP tissue. In contrast, over-expression of stefin A was present in nearly all layers of the proliferative squamous cells of IP, but expression of stefin A was only detected in a scattered area of normal sinus mucosa. CONCLUSION: Down-regulation of cathepsin S and up-regulation of its endogenous inhibitor, stefin A, were found in IP tissues as compared with their expression level in normal sinus mucosa tissues. The biological significance of inverse expression of both stefin A and cathepsin S in sinonasal IP need further investigation in the future.",cancer
"A genome-wide association study of Hodgkin's lymphoma identifies new susceptibility loci at 2p16.1 (REL), 8q24.21 and 10p14 (GATA3). To identify susceptibility loci for classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (cHL), we conducted a genome-wide association study of 589 individuals with cHL (cases) and 5,199 controls with validation in four independent samples totaling 2,057 cases and 3,416 controls. We identified three new susceptibility loci at 2p16.1 (rs1432295, REL, odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, combined P = 1.91 x 10(-8)), 8q24.21 (rs2019960, PVT1, OR = 1.33, combined P = 1.26 x 10(-13)) and 10p14 (rs501764, GATA3, OR = 1.25, combined P = 7.05 x 10(-8)). Furthermore, we confirmed the role of the major histocompatibility complex in disease etiology by revealing a strong human leukocyte antigen (HLA) association (rs6903608, OR = 1.70, combined P = 2.84 x 10(-50)). These data provide new insight into the pathogenesis of cHL.",cancer
"SRD5A2 gene mutations--a population-based review.

The review provides evidence of variation in the mutational spectrum of the SRD5A2 gene leading to population-specific high prevalence of characteristic disease or phenotypic expression.",cancer
"Pediatric brain tumor treatment: growth consequences and their management. Tumors of the central nervous system, the most common solid tumors of childhood, are a major source of cancer-related morbidity and mortality in children. Survival rates have improved significantly following treatment for childhood brain tumors, with this growing cohort of survivors at high risk of adverse medical and late effects. Endocrine morbidities are the most prominent disorder among the spectrum of longterm conditions, with growth hormone deficiency the most common endocrinopathy noted, either from tumor location or after cranial irradiation and treatment effects on the hypothalamic/pituitary unit. Deficiency of other anterior pituitary hormones can contribute to negative effects on growth, body image and composition, sexual function, skeletal health, and quality of life. Pediatric and adult endocrinologists often provide medical care to this increasing population. Therefore, a thorough understanding of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of growth failure as a consequence of childhood brain tumor, both during and after treatment, is necessary and the main focus of this review.",cancer
"Use of fluorine-18-labelled deoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography to localize a paraganglioma in pregnancy. A nine-weeks pregnant, 27-year-old female was admitted for hypertension with a blood pressure of 213/110 mm Hg, headaches, palpitations, and anxiety. There was no previous history of hypertension or pre-eclampsia. She had elevated urinary normetanephrine, plasma-free normetanephrine, and plasma-free metanephrine concentrations. Phenoxybenzamine and labetalol were initiated for presumed pheochromocytoma. At thirteen weeks of pregnancy, a noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the abdomen failed to identify an adrenal or extra-adrenal mass. At 21-weeks gestation, an abdominal [18-F]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography demonstrated an extra-adrenal lesion. The patient underwent a laparotomy during the second trimester with successful removal of a benign paraganglioma.",cancer
"Two rare breast tumors in a small community hospital. Rhabdomyosarcoma and schwannoma are two of the rarer tumors seen in the surgical setting, and it is rarer still to see these tumors originate in the breast. Rhabdomyosarcoma has an incidence of only 250 cases a year in the United States; of these, more than 90% are seen in individuals 25 years and younger. To our knowledge, only 24 cases of primary breast schwannoma have been reported in the English literature to date. Here, we present the cases of two perimenopausal women who presented with a primary rhabdomyosarcoma and a primary schwannoma at a small community hospital in central Florida within a period of less than three years. These cases provide an interesting juxtaposition to the management of typical breast cancer. Through proper evaluation, such cases can be treated without need of referral to a tertiary center, despite the extreme rarity of their conditions.",cancer

"Rectal cancer surgery with or without bowel preparation: The French GRECCAR III multicenter single-blinded randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: To assess with a single-blinded, multicenter, randomized trial, the postoperative results in patients undergoing sphincter-saving rectal resection for cancer without preoperative mechanical bowel preparation (MBP). BACKGROUND: The collective evidence from literature strongly suggests that MBP, before elective colonic surgery, is of no benefit in terms of postoperative morbidity. Very few data and no randomized study are available for rectal surgery and preliminary results conclude toward the safety of rectal resection without MBP. METHODS: From October 2007 to January 2009, patients scheduled for elective rectal cancer sphincter-saving resection were randomized to receive preoperative MBP (ie, retrograde enema and oral laxatives) or not. Primary endpoint was the overall 30-day morbidity rate. Secondary endpoints included mortality rate, anastomotic leakage rate, major morbidity rate (Dindo III or more), degree of discomfort for the patient, and hospital stay. RESULTS: A total of 178 patients (103 men), including 89 in both groups (no-MBP and MBP groups), were included in the study. The overall and infectious morbidity rates were significantly higher in no-MBP versus MBP group, 44% versus 27%, P = 0.018, and 34% versus 16%, P = 0.005, respectively. Regarding both anastomotic leakage and major morbidity rates, there was no significant difference between no-MBP and MBP group: 19% versus 10% (P = 0.09) and 18% versus 11% (P = 0.69), respectively. Moderate or severe discomfort was reported by 40% of prepared patients. Mortality rate (1.1% vs 3.4%) and mean hospital stay (16 vs 14 days) did not differ significantly between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: This first randomized trial demonstrated that rectal cancer surgery without MBP was associated with higher risk of overall and infectious morbidity rates without any significant increase of anastomotic leakage rate. Thus, it suggests continuing to perform MBP before elective rectal resection for cancer.",cancer
"The impact of 68Ga-DOTATOC positron emission tomography/computed tomography on the multimodal management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of 68Ga-DOTATOC positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) on the multimodal management of neuroendocrine tumors (NET). BACKGROUND: Establishment of the extent and progression of NET are necessary to decide which treatment option to choose. However, morphological imaging with CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is often inadequate in identifying the primary tumor and/or in detecting small metastatic lesions. METHODS: In total, 52 patients (27 women and 25 men) with histologically proven NET could be included in the protocol of comparison between 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT and CT and/or MRI. The examinations were performed in terms of tumor staging and, in some instances, also of primary tumor site identification to evaluate the patient's eligibility for treatment. Each patient presented with either CT and/or MRI performed elsewhere and consecutively underwent 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT in our institution. RESULTS: In all 52 patients, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT demonstrated pathologically increased uptake for at least 1 tumor site, yielding a sensitivity of 100% on a patient basis. In 3 of 4 patients with unknown primary tumor site, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT visualized the primary tumor region (jejunum, ileum, and pancreas, respectively) not identified on CT and/or MRI. 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT detected additional hepatic and/or extrahepatic metastases in 22 of the 33 patients diagnosed with hepatic metastases on CT and/or MRI. Of the 15 patients evaluated for liver transplantation, we omitted 7 (46.6%) from further screening because of evidence of metastatic deposits not seen by conventional imaging. Overall, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT altered our treatment decision based on CT and/or MRI alone, in 31 (59.6%) of the 52 patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT proved clearly superior to CT and/or MRI for detection and staging of NET. More important, 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT impacted our treatment decision in more than every second patient.",cancer
"Therapeutic delay and survival after surgery for cancer of the pancreatic head with or without preoperative biliary drainage. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between delay in surgery because of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) and survival in patients scheduled for surgery for pancreatic head cancer. BACKGROUND: Patients with obstructive jaundice due to pancreatic head cancer can undergo PBD. The associated delay of surgery can lead to more advanced cancer stages at surgical exploration, affecting resection rate and survival. METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical trial to compare PBD with early surgery (ES) for pancreatic head cancer for complications. We obtained Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival for patients with pathology-proven malignancy and compared survival functions of ES and PBD groups using log-rank test statistics. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic role of time to surgery for overall survival. RESULTS: Mean times from randomization to surgery were 1.2 (0.9-1.5) and 5.1 (4.8-5.5) weeks in the ES and PBD groups, respectively (P < 0.001). In the ES group, 60 (67%) of 89 patients underwent resection, versus 53 (58%) of 91 patients in the PBD group (P = 0.20). Median survival after randomization was 12.2 (9.1-15.4) months in the ES group versus 12.7 (8.9-16.6) months in the PBD group (P = 0.91). A longer time to surgery was significantly associated with slightly lower mortality rate after surgery (hazard ratio = 0.90, 95% CI, 0.83-0.97), when taking into account resection, bilirubin, complications, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, tumor-positive lymph nodes, and microscopically residual disease. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with pancreatic head cancer, the delay in surgery associated with PBD does not impair or benefit survival rate.",cancer
"Surgical management of submucosal esophageal cancer: extended or regional lymphadenectomy? INTRODUCTION: Radical esophagectomy is considered the standard therapy for tumors that infiltrate the submucosa of the esophagus (T1b), as the prevalence of lymph node metastases has been reported in up to 40% of these patients. It remains unclear whether radical esophagectomy with extended lymphadenectomy is needed or whether a surgical procedure with only regional lymphadenectomy suffices. The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of patients who underwent esophagectomy for T1b cancer through a transthoracic approach with extended lymphadenectomy (TTE) with those of patients in whom transhiatal esophagectomy (THE) was performed with a regional lymph node dissection. METHODS: Patients who underwent esophagectomy for T1b cancer between 1990 and 2004 and who did not receive (neo)adjuvant therapy were included. Data were collected from prospective databases of 4 centers. In Leuven, Belgium (n = 101), and Los Angeles, CA (n = 31), patients with T1b tumors had been operated on via TTE with extended lymphadenectomy, whereas in Amsterdam (n = 43) and Rotterdam (n = 47), the Netherlands, THE with regional lymphadenectomy had been performed. RESULTS: The 2 patient groups (TTE, n = 132; THE, n = 90) were comparable with regard to age, body mass index, and ASA classification. Operative time was longer in patients who underwent TTE (390 minutes) versus THE (250 minutes) (P < 0.001). The yield of lymph nodes resected was higher in the TTE group (median: 32) versus THE (median: 10) (P < 0.001). Overall morbidity, in-hospital mortality, and length of hospital stay were comparable between both the groups. In the TTE group, 27.3% of complications were classified as major versus 14.4% in the THE group (P < 0.001); however, the reoperation rate was higher after THE (12.2%) versus TTE (3.8%) (P = 0.01). There was no difference in pathological outcomes (infiltration depth, pN stage, pM stage, positive lymph node ratio) between both groups. Overall, 5-year survival (63.4% TTE vs 69.4% THE; P = 0.55) and disease-free 5-year survival (76.9% TTE vs 78.3% THE; P = 0.65) were comparable between both the groups. In patients with N1 disease, disease-free 5-year survival was 49.8% in the TTE group versus 40.0% in the THE group (P = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with submucosal esophageal cancer (T1b), TTE with extended lymphadenectomy and THE with regional lymphadenectomy had similar short-term outcome and long-term survival. In the selected group of T1bN1 patients, TTE may be the preferred operative technique because of a potential disease-free survival benefit; in patients with T1bN0 disease, THE with en bloc dissection of the esophagus and regional lymph nodes offers an oncologically safe and less invasive treatment.",cancer
"The severity of neural invasion is a crucial prognostic factor in rectal cancer independent of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive characterization of neural invasion (NI) in rectal adenocarcinoma (RC), to establish a novel NI-severity scoring system, and to assess the prognostic value of NI with emphasis on its localization and severity. BACKGROUND: The literature merely contains small-scale studies with limited histopathological characterization of NI in RC. METHODS: Neural invasion was thoroughly characterized in 296 patients with locally advanced uT3-RC (139 with primary resection and 157 with neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy [nRCTx]). To identify the precise localization of NI, we investigated the main tumor, peritumoral area, adjacent normal tissue, and all lymph nodes. To classify the clinical impact of NI, an NI severity score was established and related to patient prognosis. RESULTS: Neural invasion was detected in 32% of patients with primary resection and in 19% (P = 0.010) receiving nRCTx. The major location of NI was found in the peritumoral area. The prevalence of NI in the main tumor within the primary resection group was 6%, whereas it was absent in the nRCTx group (P = 0.002). Increasing NI severity, but not NI localization, was associated with a significantly poorer survival and increased local recurrence rate in both groups. Multivariate analysis (including TNM-stage, grading, and Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)) revealed NI prevalence and severity as independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: Neural invasion in RC has a heterogeneous appearance in regard to its localization and its severity. nRCTx seems to have a suppressive effect on NI. Neural invasion severity might be applied as a novel tool to estimate accurately patient's prognosis and thus should be considered in pathology reports.",cancer
"Interval between neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and surgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus: does delayed surgery have an impact on outcome? OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study was to evaluate whether delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) affects postoperative outcomes in patients with locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the thoracic esophagus. BACKGROUND: Esophagectomy is usually recommended within 4 to 6 weeks after completion of neoadjuvant CRT. However, the optimal timing of surgery is not clearly defined. METHODS: A total of 129 consecutive patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer, treated between 1998 and 2007, were retrospectively analyzed using prospectively collected data. Patients were divided into 3 groups on the basis of timing to surgery: group 1, </=30 days (n = 17); group 2, 31 to 60 days (n = 83); and group 3, 61 to 90 days (n = 29). Subsequently, only 2-numerically more consistent-groups were studied, using the median value of timing intervals as a cutoff level: group A, </=46 days (n = 66); and group B, >46 days (n = 63). RESULTS: Groups were comparable in terms of patient and tumor characteristics, type of neoadjuvant regimen, toxicity, postoperative morbidity and mortality rates, tumor downstaging, and pathologic complete responses. The overall 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0% in group 1, 43.1% in group 2, and 35.9% in group 3 (P = 0.13). After R0 resection (n = 106), the 5-year actuarial survival rate was 0%, 51%, and 47.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). Tumor recurrence after R0 resection seemed to be inversely related, even if not significantly (P = 0.17), to the time interval between chemoradiation and surgery: 50% in group 1, 40.6% in group 2, and 21.7% in group 3. When considering only 2 groups, the overall 5-year survival was 33.1% in group A and 42.7% in group B (P = 0.64); after R0 resection, the 5-year survival was 37.8% and 56.3%, respectively (P = 0.18). The rate of tumor recurrence was significantly lower in group B (25%) than in group A (48.3%) (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Delayed surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiation does not compromise the outcomes of patients with locally advanced SCC of the esophagus. Delaying surgery up to 90 days offers relevant advantages in the clinical management of the patients, can reduce tumor recurrences, and may improve prognosis after complete R0 resection surgery.",cancer
"Is perioperative chemotherapy useful for solitary, metachronous, colorectal liver metastases? BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy is increasingly used in colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs) even when they are initially resectable. The aim of our study was to address the still pending question of whether perioperative chemotherapy is really beneficial in patients developing solitary metastases at a distance from surgery of the primary. METHODS: We analyzed a multicentric cohort of 1471 patients resected for solitary, metachronous, primarily resectable CRLMs without extrahepatic disease in the LiverMetSurvey International Registry over a 15-year period. Patients who received at least 3 cycles of oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapy before liver surgery (group CS, n = 169) were compared with those who were resected upfront (group S, n = 1302). RESULTS: Patients of group CS were more frequently females (49% vs 36%, P = 0.001) and had larger metastases (>/=5 cm, 33% vs 23%, P = 0.007); no difference was observed with regard to age, site of the primary tumour, time delay to occurrence of metastases, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels at the time of diagnosis in the 2 groups. The rate of postoperative complications was significantly higher in group CS (37.2% vs 24% in group S, P = 0.006). At univariate analysis, preoperative chemotherapy did not impact the overall survival (OS) (60% at 5 years in both groups); however, postoperative chemotherapy was associated with better OS (65% vs 55% at 5 years, P < 0.01). At multivariate analysis, age 70 years or older (P = 0.05), lymph node positivity in the primary tumor (P = 0.02), a primary-to-metastases time delay of less than 12 months (P = 0.04), raised CEA levels of more than 5 ng/mL at diagnosis (P < 0.01), a tumor diameter of 5 cm or more (P < 0.01), noncurative liver resection (P < 0.01), and the absence of postoperative chemotherapy (P < 0.01) were independent prognostic factors of survival. The disease-free survival (DFS) was negatively influenced by CEA level of more than 5 ng/mL (P < 0.01), size of the metastases 5 cm or more (P = 0.05), and the absence of postoperative chemotherapy (P < 0.01). When patients with metastases of less than 5 cm in size were compared to those with metastases of size 5 cm or more, preoperative chemotherapy did not influence the OS or DFS in either group. Postoperative chemotherapy, on the other hand, improved OS and DFS in patients with metastases of size 5 cm or more but not in patients with metastases of less than 5 cm in size. CONCLUSIONS: Although preoperative chemotherapy does not seem to benefit the outcome of patients with solitary, metachronous CRLM, postoperative chemotherapy is associated with better OS and DFS, mainly when the tumor diameter exceeds 5 cm.",cancer
"Carcinoid tumors of the rectum: a multi-institutional international collaboration. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe recent experience with rectal carcinoids in European and North American centers. BACKGROUND: While considered indolent, the propensity of carcinoids to metastasize can be significant. METHODS: Rectal carcinoid patients were identified from prospective databases maintained at 9 institutions between 1999 and 2008. Demographic, clinical, and histologic data were collated. Median follow-up was 5 years (range, 0.5-10 years). RESULTS: Two hundred two patients were identified. The median age was 55 years (range, 31-81 years). The majority of tumors were an incidental finding (n = 115, 56.9%). The median tumor size was 10 mm (range, 2-120 mm). Overall, 93 (49%) tumors were limited to the mucosa or submucosa, 45 (24%) involved the muscularis propria, 29 (15%) extended into the perirectal fat, and 6 (3%) reached the visceral peritoneum. The primary treatment modalities were endoscopic resection (n = 86, 43%) and surgical extirpation (n = 102, 50%). Forty-one patients (40%) underwent a high anterior resection, whereas 45 (44%) underwent anterior resection with total mesorectal excision. Seven patients (7%) underwent Hartman's procedure, 7 (7%) underwent abdomino-perineal resection, and 6 (6%) had transanal endoscopic microsurgery, whereas 4 (4%) patients underwent a transanal excision. Multiple variable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that tumor size greater than 10 mm and lymphovascular invasion were predictors of nodal involvement (P = 0.006 and < 0.001, respectively), whereas the presence of lymph node metastases and lymphovascular invasion was associated with subsequent development of distant metastases (P = 0.033 and 0.022, respectively). The presence of nodal metastases has a profound effect upon survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 70%, and 10-year survival of 60% for node positive tumors. Patients with distant metastases have a 4-year survival of 38%. CONCLUSION: Tumor size greater than 10 mm and lymphovascular invasion are significantly associated with the presence of nodal disease, rendering mesorectal excision advisable. Transanal excision is adequate for smaller tumors.",cancer
"A multicenter study of survival after neoadjuvant radiotherapy/chemotherapy and esophagectomy for ypT0N0M0R0 esophageal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate 5-year survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal cancer (LAEC) who have undergone multimodality treatment with complete histopathologic response. BACKGROUND: Patients with LAEC may obtain excellent local-regional response to multimodality therapy. The overall benefit of a complete histopathologic response, when no viable tumor is present in the surgical specimen, is incompletely understood and existing data are limited to single-center studies with relatively few patients. The aim of this multicenter study was to define the outcome of patients with complete histopathologic response after multimodality therapy for LAEC. METHODS: The study population included 299 patients (229 male, 70 female; median age: 60 years) with LAEC (cT2N1M0, T3-4N0-1M0; 181 adenocarcinomas, 118 squamous carcinomas) who underwent either neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (n = 284) or chemotherapy (n = 15) followed by esophagectomy at 6 specialized centers: Europe (3) and United States (3). All patients in the study had stage ypT0N0M0R0 after resection. RESULTS: Esophagectomy with thoracotomy (n = 255) was more frequent than with a transhiatal approach (n = 44). The median number of analyzed lymph nodes in the surgical specimens was 20 (minimum-maximum: 1-77). Thirty-day mortality rate was 2.4% and 90-day mortality rate was 5.7%. Overall 5-year survival rate was 55%. The disease-specific 5-year survival rate was 68%, with a recurrence rate of 23.4% (n = 70; local vs distant recurrence: 3.3% vs 20.1%). Cox regression analysis identified age as the only independent predictor of survival, whereas gender, histology, type of esophagectomy, type of neoadjuvant therapy, and the number of resected lymph nodes had no prognostic impact. CONCLUSION: Patients with histopathologic complete response at the time of resection of LAEC achieve excellent survival.",cancer
"Extended liver resection for polycystic liver disease can challenge liver transplantation. OBJECTIVE: In an attempt to refine the indications for liver resection (LR) for highly symptomatic polycystic liver disease (PLD), we focused on the characteristics, technical difficulties, postoperative outcome, and long-term follow-up of PLD patients who underwent either LR or liver transplantation (LT). METHODS: Since 1995, among 72 patients with massive hepatomegaly, 45 patients underwent LR associated with contralateral cyst fenestration whereas 27 underwent LT associated with simultaneous kidney transplantations in 23. The LR group was characterized by absence of end-stage renal insufficiency, absence of ascites, and better nutrition status. In the LR group, the volumetry of the spared noncystic parenchyma was preoperatively assessed whereas pathological analysis focused on fibrosis and vascular congestion. RESULTS: After LR, the mortality was nil and overall morbidity was 71%, including biliary leak in 20% and ascites in 42%. Persistent and massive ascites was observed in 8 patients who have undergone extensive resection and had significantly more frequently fibrosis on the analysis of their resected surgical specimens (P = 0.002). A volume of the remnant noncystic parenchyma less than 30% and the presence of vascular changes on the specimen were associated with higher risk of complications. The 5-year survival was 95% and among the 43 survivors, after a mean follow-up of 41 months, 36 (83%) patients stated that they were satisfied, with complete relief of symptoms in 30 (70%). After LT, the postoperative mortality was 15% and the overall morbidity was 85%, including 12 patients who required reoperation. Severe complications were more frequent in the presence of denutrition and preoperative ascites. The 5-year survival was 85% and after a mean follow-up of 36 months all survivors had complete relief of symptoms due to hepatomegaly. CONCLUSIONS: In case of massive hepatomegaly from PLD without end-stage renal failure, LR should be considered first when preserved remnant liver volume represents at least 30% of the total volume liver in the absence of vascular changes or fibrosis.",cancer
Metastatic adenocarcinoma after intramedullary fixation of a tibial fracture: A report of two cases. We present two cases of metastatic lung cancer which occurred at the site of a previously united tibial fracture. Both patients were treated with a locked intramedullary nail. The patients presented with metastases at the site of their initial fracture approximately 16 and 13 months after injury respectively. We discuss this unusual presentation and review the relevant literature. We are unaware of any previous reports of a metastatic tumour occurring at the site of an orthopaedic implant used to stabilise a non-pathological fracture. These cases demonstrate the similar clinical presentation of infection and malignancy: a diagnosis which should always be considered in such patients.,cancer
"The prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma who have received prior manipulative therapy. We evaluated the long-term outcome of patients with an osteosarcoma who had undergone prior manipulative therapy, a popular treatment in Asia, and investigated its effects on several prognostic factors. Of the 134 patients in this study, 70 (52%) patients had manipulative therapy and 64 (48%) did not. The age, location, and size of tumour were not significantly different between the groups. The five-year overall survival rate was 58% and 92% in the groups with and without manipulative therapy (p = 0.004). Both the primary and overall rates of lung metastasis were significantly higher in the manipulative group (primary: 32% vs 3%, p = 0.003; overall lung metastasis rate: 51.4% vs 18.8%, p < 0.001). Patients who had manipulative therapy had higher local recurrence rates in comparison to patients who did not (29% vs 6%, p = 0.011). The prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma who had manipulative therapy was significantly poorer than those who had not. Manipulative therapy was an independent factor for survival. This form of therapy may serve as a mechanism to accelerate the spread of tumour cells, and therefore must be avoided in order to improve the outcome for patients with an osteosarcoma.",cancer
"Free vascularised fibular graft for reconstruction of defects of the lower limb after resection of tumour. We describe a retrospective review of 38 cases of reconstruction following resection of the metaphysiodiaphysis of the lower limb for malignant bone tumours using free vascularised fibular grafts. The mean follow-up was for 7.6 years (0.4 to 18.4). The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score was 27.2 (20 to 30). The score was significantly higher when the graft was carried out in a one-stage procedure after resection of the tumour rather than in two stages. Bony union was achieved in 89% of the cases. The overall mean time to union was 1.7 years (0.2 to 10.3). Free vascularised fibular transfer is a major operation with frequent, but preventable, complications which allows salvage of the limb with satisfactory functional results.",cancer
"The outcome of pelvic reconstruction with non-vascularised fibular grafts after resection of bone tumours. We retrospectively evaluated 18 patients with a mean age of 37.3 years (14 to 72) who had undergone pelvic reconstruction stabilised with a non-vascularised fibular graft after resection of a primary bone tumour. The mean follow-up was 10.14 years (2.4 to 15.7). The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society Score was 76.5% (50% to 100%). Primary union was achieved in the majority of reconstructions within a mean of 22.9 weeks (7 to 60.6). The three patients with delayed or nonunion all received additional therapy (chemotherapy/radiation) (p = 0.0162). The complication rate was comparable to that of other techniques described in the literature. Non-vascularised fibular transfer to the pelvis is a simpler, cheaper and quicker procedure than other currently described techniques. It is a biological reconstruction with good results and a relatively low donor site complication rate. However, adjuvant therapy can negatively affect the outcome of such grafts.",cancer
"Earlier diagnosis of bone and soft-tissue tumours. Although bone and soft-tissue sarcomas are rare, early diagnosis and prompt referral to a specialised unit offers the best chance of a successful outcome both in terms of survival and surgical resection. This paper highlights the clinical and radiological features that might suggest the possibility of a bone or soft-tissue sarcoma and suggests a succinct management pathway for establishing whether a suspicious bone or soft-tissue lesion could be malignant.",cancer
"Independent association of lobular involution and mammographic breast density with breast cancer risk. BACKGROUND: Lobular involution, or age-related atrophy of breast lobules, is inversely associated with breast cancer risk, and mammographic breast density (MBD) is positively associated with breast cancer risk. METHODS: To evaluate whether lobular involution and MBD are independently associated with breast cancer risk in women with benign breast disease, we performed a nested cohort study among women (n = 2666) with benign breast disease diagnosed at Mayo Clinic between January 1, 1985, and December 31, 1991 and a mammogram available within 6 months of the diagnosis. Women were followed up for an average of 13.3 years to document any breast cancer incidence. Lobular involution was categorized as none, partial, or complete; parenchymal pattern was classified using the Wolfe classification as N1 (nondense), P1, P2 (ductal prominence occupying <25%, or >25% of the breast, respectively), or DY (extremely dense). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess associations of lobular involution and MBD with breast cancer risk were estimated using adjusted Cox proportional hazards model. All tests of statistical significance were two-sided. RESULTS: After adjustment for MBD, having no or partial lobular involution was associated with a higher risk of breast cancer than having complete involution (none: HR of breast cancer incidence = 2.62, 95% CI = 1.39 to 4.94; partial: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.53; P(trend) = .002). Similarly, after adjustment for involution, having dense breasts was associated with higher risk of breast cancer than having nondense breasts (for DY: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.03 to 2.73; for P2: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.20 to 3.21; for P1: HR of breast cancer incidence = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.67 to 2.26; P(trend) = .02). Having a combination of no involution and dense breasts was associated with higher risk of breast cancer than having complete involution and nondense breasts (HR of breast cancer incidence = 4.08, 95% CI = 1.72 to 9.68; P = .006). CONCLUSION: Lobular involution and MBD are independently associated with breast cancer incidence; combined, they are associated with an even greater risk for breast cancer.",cancer
"Selective inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) induces DNA damage and sensitizes transformed cells to anticancer agents. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is structurally and functionally unique among the 11 human zinc-dependent histone deacetylases. Here we show that chemical inhibition with the HDAC6-selective inhibitor tubacin significantly enhances cell death induced by the topoisomerase II inhibitors etoposide and doxorubicin and the pan-HDAC inhibitor SAHA (vorinostat) in transformed cells (LNCaP, MCF-7), an effect not observed in normal cells (human foreskin fibroblast cells). The inactive analogue of tubacin, nil-tubacin, does not sensitize transformed cells to these anticancer agents. Further, we show that down-regulation of HDAC6 expression by shRNA in LNCaP cells enhances cell death induced by etoposide, doxorubicin, and SAHA. Tubacin in combination with SAHA or etoposide is more potent than either drug alone in activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in transformed cells, as evidenced by an increase in PARP cleavage and partial inhibition of this effect by the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. HDAC6 inhibition with tubacin induces the accumulation of gammaH2AX, an early marker of DNA double-strand breaks. Tubacin enhances DNA damage induced by etoposide or SAHA as indicated by increased accumulation of gammaH2AX and activation of the checkpoint kinase Chk2. Tubacin induces the expression of DDIT3 (CHOP/GADD153), a transcription factor up-regulated in response to cellular stress. DDIT3 induction is further increased when tubacin is combined with SAHA. These findings point to mechanisms by which HDAC6-selective inhibition can enhance the efficacy of certain anti-cancer agents in transformed cells.",cancer
"Cardiopulmonary toxicity of different chemoradiotherapy combined regimens for Hodgkin's disease. The majority of patients with Hodgkin's disease can be cured by combination of polychemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) that can produce late toxic pulmonary and cardiac effects which often remain at a subclinical level. The aim of the present investigation was to compare the late pulmonary and cardiac toxicity of three chemotherapeutic regimens combined with RT and particularly doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD), vincristine, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and prednisone (VEBEP) and ABVD with mechloretamine, vincristine, procarbazine and prednisone (MOPP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated 147 patients suffering from Hodgkin's disease after a follow-up of at least 5 years from the completion of CT-RT. Seventy-eight patients were submitted to ABVD-RT, 36 to VEBEP-RT and 33 to MOPP-ABVD-RT. Patients underwent spirometry, 2D-doppler echocardiography at rest, cardiopulmonary exercise test on cycloergometer and determination of cardiac output by a non invasive method. RESULTS: Patients of the three different treatment groups showed tolerance to exercise, and oxygen consumption significantly lower than the predicted values but there were no statistically significant difference between the three groups. Nevertheless, patients treated with VEBEP and with MOPP-ABVD showed an ejection fraction at rest lower than those observed in the ABVD group and patients treated with VEBEP showed a cardiac output for oxygen uptake lower than those observed in the ABVD and MOPP-ABVD treatment groups. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that the combination of mediastinal RT with the more commonly used polychemotherapy regimens produce late toxic effects. The lower exercise capacity seems to be due to a combination of decreased cardiac performance and impairment of ventilation. The VEBEP regimens could be potentially more toxic for the heart, probably because of the higher cumulative dose of anthracyclines.",cancer
"Relationship between thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene polymorphism and TYMS protein levels in patients with high-risk breast cancer. The thymidylate synthase gene (TYMS) has three functional polymorphisms which are associated with TYMS expression. To explore the predictability of TYMS polymorphisms for the sensitivity and toxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in breast cancer patients, this study investigated the association between TYMS polymorphisms and TYMS protein expression in normal and tumour tissue specimens from 49 lymph node-positive breast cancer patients. An analysis of the TYMS 3'-UTR polymorphism showed that level of TYMS protein in normal tissue with the +6 bp/+6 bp genotype was significantly higher than that for the -6 bp/+6 bp genotype. Tumour tissue with the +6 bp/+6 bp genotype had a significantly higher TYMS protein expression than did those with other genotypes. These findings suggest that breast cancer patients with the TYMS 3'-UTR +6 bp/+6 bp polymorphism whose tumours show a 6 bp deletion within TYMS 3'-UTR represent a group that may derive the most benefit from 5-FU chemotherapy.",cancer
"Prognostic value of IL-6 in localized prostatic cancer. AIM: The usefulness of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and its soluble receptor IL-6sR in the prediction of the biochemical recurrence was evaluated in patients with prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IL-6 and sIL-6R serum levels were measured in 96 patients with prostate cancer. RESULTS: Using the log-rank test, it was evident that patients with preoperative serum levels of IL-6 higher than 1.2 pg/ml had a significantly increased probability of biochemical recurrence (p=0.031). We also observed that the Gleason score was associated with the risk of progression (p=0.033), but no relation was observed with TNM classification, PSA, % free PSA or sIL-6R. In a multivariate analysis, only IL-6 serum levels remained as a predictor of biochemical recurrence (p=0.040). CONCLUSION: The results presented here demonstrated the usefulness of IL-6 in predicting the biochemical progression of prostate cancer, pointing towards an association between inflammation and the aggressiveness of the tumor.",cancer
"Immunochemical staining of MT2-MMP correlates positively to angiogenesis of human esophageal cancer. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play an important role in the pathological processes of degradation of extracellular matrix and destruction of basement membrane, which leads to tumor invasion and metastasis. In the present study, we investigated membrane-type 2 MMP (MT2-MMP) expression pattern in esophageal cancer tissues collected from 103 patients, and explored MT2-MMP expression pattern in correlation to patients' clinicopathological features, intratumoral angiogenesis and postoperative prognoses. The intensity of immunochemical staining of MT2-MMP was significantly positively correlated to the intratumoral angiogenesis of esophageal cancer tissues. Positive MT2-MMP immunoreactions were found in 85.4% of total tumor sections, whereas none or very weak MT2-MMP staining occurred in normal esophageal tissues. In addition, MT2-MMP immunochemical intensities were significantly correlated to tumor size, but not to patient's gender, age, invasion depth, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Moreover, MT2-MMP levels could not be applied for predicting patients' survival rate although the H-score cut-off value showed the overall survival rate of patients with low MT2-MMP protein level to be better than those with high MT2-MMP protein level.",cancer
"Carboplatin plus weekly paclitaxel treatment in non-small cell lung cancer patients with interstitial lung disease. BACKGROUND: Since advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with the interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been excluded from clinical trials, it is uncertain whether chemotherapy really provides a benefit to these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen advanced NSCLC patients with ILD that was detected on the chest X-rays were enrolled in this study. Carboplatin plus paclitaxel was administered by two methods (method A or method B). Method A: Carboplatin (AUC 6, day 1) and paclitaxel (70 mg/m(2), days 1, 8, 15) were administered every four weeks. Method B: Carboplatin (AUC 2, day 1, 8, 15) and paclitaxel (60 mg/m(2), days 1, 8, 15) were administered every four weeks. RESULTS: The response rate and the disease control rate were 33% and 53%. The median progression-free survival and the median overall survival time were 2.5 months and 7.0 months, respectively. The hematological toxicities were tolerable, but a grade 3 or higher pneumonitis was observed in 4 patients (27%). CONCLUSION: Carboplatin plus weekly paclitaxel must be administered carefully to advanced NSCLC patients with ILD that is detected on chest X-rays after a sufficient evaluation of the risks and the benefits.",cancer
"High prevalence of human anti-mouse antibodies in the serum of colorectal cancer patients. BACKGROUND: Monoclonal antibody treatment induces the expression of human anti-mouse antibodies (HAMA), which in turn interfere with the therapy. However, whether HAMAs are expressed before the initiation of antibody therapy in patients with colorectal cancer remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 40 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Serum samples from 157 individuals without cancer were used as controls. None of the patients received imaging or therapeutic antibodies before the study. The expression of HAMAs was evaluated by ELISA with murine immunoglobulin G1 (mIgG)1, mIgG2a and mIgG2b as the antigen. RESULTS: Of the 40 colorectal cancer patients, 9 (22.5%) expressed either IgG- or IgM-type HAMAs while only 13/157 (8.2%) of the individuals without cancer expressed the HAMAs (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: HAMAs are prevalent in the serum of colorectal cancer patients even before antibody administration. Medical practitioners should be alert to the possibility of HAMA expression when administering antibody therapy.",cancer
"Disease-free interval after primary treatment predicts prognosis of recurrent endometrial carcinoma. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine if the disease-free interval after initial surgical resection has any useful prognostic value for recurrent endometrial carcinoma patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1998 and 2007, complete resection of endometrial carcinoma was achieved in 536 cases at the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Osaka University and Osaka Rosai Hospitals of Osaka, Japan. Clinical characteristics of these cases were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Recurrence was subsequently detected in 54 cases. Overall survival after recurrence in 27 patients with recurrences earlier than 12 months who received no postoperative therapy, radiation, and chemotherapy as an adjuvant therapy were significantly shorter than that of those with recurrences later than 12 months with similar treatments. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the disease-free interval was an independent factor for prognosis. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate a significantly worse prognosis in cases with early versus late recurrence of resected endometrial carcinomas, irrespective of the type of adjuvant therapy.",cancer
"Cytokeratin 19 fragment/carcinoembryonic antigen ratio in pleural effusion is a useful marker for detecting malignant pleural mesothelioma. BACKGROUND: The clinical utility of tumour markers in pleural effusion is still controversial with regard to the efficient detection of malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1) were retrospectively studied in pleural effusion of unknown origin in patients who had undergone medical thoracoscopy under local anaesthesia. RESULTS: The study included 134 patients (103 men and 31 women); among them, 33 had MPM. The level of pleural effusion CYFRA 21-1 and the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio were significantly different between MPM and other diseases (p<0.01). The sensitivity and specificity of the pleural effusion CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio were 84.8% and 80.2%, respectively, when the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio cut-off value determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 19.1. CONCLUSION: MPM should be suspected when the CYFRA 21-1/CEA ratio in pleural effusion is greater than 19.1.",cancer
"A retrospective analysis of non-platinum-based first- and second-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND: Platinum-based chemotherapy represents the standard of care for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) while non-platinum-based regimens are frequently administered in patients with relapse. A retrospective analysis of the sequence administration of these regimens in the first- and second-line setting was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of patients enrolled in the Hellenic Oncology Research Groups's randomized advanced NSCLC trials from February 1997 to September 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. The efficacy of non-platinum-based chemotherapy administered as first- or second-line treatment (n=94, cohort A) was compared to that of non-platinum-based first-line followed by platinum-based second-line chemotherapy (n=267, cohort B), and the reverse sequence (n=123, cohort C). RESULTS: The objective response rate (ORR) to first-line chemotherapy was higher in cohort C compared to cohort A (45.5% vs. 25.5%, respectively, p=0.002) and cohort B (45.5% vs. 21.3%, p=0.0001). The ORR to second-line therapy was 17%, 13.1% (p=0.349) and 7.3% (p=0.027) in cohorts A, B and C, respectively. Time to progression and the overall survival were comparable among the three cohorts in both first- and second line therapy. CONCLUSION: Platinum-based first-line chemotherapy improved response rate compared to non-platinum-based regimens; however, the overall survival was comparable, irrespective of the sequence administration of these regimens is the first- and second-line setting.",cancer
"Irinotecan/fluorouracil/leucovorin or the same regimen followed by oxaliplatin/fluorouracil/leucovorin in metastatic colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND: This study reports the long-term follow-up of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) participating in a randomised phase II study that compared the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of irinotecan (IRI), fluorouracil (FU) with leucovorin (LV) (arm A) versus sequential chemotherapy with IRI plus FU/LV followed by oxaliplatin (OXA) plus FU/LV (arm B) as first line therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Intent-to-treat analysis was performed on 417 patients (211 in arm A and 206 in arm B). Treatment schedules of weekly IRI 80 mg/m(2) or OXA 45 mg/m(2) plus LV 200 mg/m(2) immediately followed by intravenous bolus FU 450 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks were followed by a 2-week rest period. Treatment continued for 4 cycles. Patients in arm A were treated with IRI/FU/LV for 4 cycles, while patients in arm B were initially treated with IRI/FU/LV for 2 cycles followed by sequential administration of 2 cycles of OXA/FU/LV. RESULTS: No significant difference emerged in overall response rate or overall survival. There was a difference in progression-free survival (median, 7.3 versus 8.2 months, p=0.040) in favour of arm B. Toxicity profiles were similar in both arms. CONCLUSION: IRI/FU/LV and IRI/FU/LV followed by OXA/FU/LV showed comparable activity with a manageable toxicity profile.",cancer
"Metronomic oral cyclophosphamide prednisolone chemotherapy is an effective treatment for metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer after docetaxel failure. BACKGROUND: There is currently no standard of treatment for patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) after failure of docetaxel-based chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to assess the anticancer activity and tolerance of metronomic cyclophosphamide prednisolone combination in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2005 to 2010, patients with HRPC who failed at least docetaxel-based chemotherapy were proposed metronomic cyclophosphamide-prednisolone regimen, and were prospectively registered. Twenty-three patients received 50 mg cyclophosphamide and 10 mg prednisolone per os daily until disease progression. Treatment tolerance and efficacy on PSA decrease and pain were studied. RESULTS: Metronomic cyclophosphamide prednisolone was safe, well tolerated, and demonstrated interesting clinical activity, yielding a prostate specific antigen decrease by >/=50% in 26% of patients and decrease by >/=30% in 48% of patients, but also favorable palliative effects on pain in 43% of patients. The median progression-free survival was 6 months (95% CI: 4-8 months) and the median overall survival was 11 months (95% CI: 7-19 months). CONCLUSION: For this patient population, low dose metronomic cyclophosphamide prednisolone might be a viable alternative. Its convenient oral administration, low cost, and lack of toxicity justify further studies alone, or in combination with other agents in HRPC patients.",cancer
"TS, DHFR and GARFT expression in non-squamous cell carcinoma of NSCLC and malignant pleural mesothelioma patients treated with pemetrexed. BACKGROUND: Recently, pemetrexed (PEM), a new generation antifolate, has been used for the treatment of patients with advanced non-squamous cell carcinoma (SQ) of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). However, no useful markers for selecting appropriate candidates exist at present. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor specimens were collected from 5 lung non-SQ and 8 MPM patients who underwent surgery and received PEM. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of the primary tumor were used to analyze the mRNA and protein expressions of thymidylate synthase (TS)/dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), and to compare the expression status and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: TS, DHFR, and GARFT mRNA levels had a median value of 2.39, 1.70, and 1.40 in non-SQ samples of NSCLC patients. The TS and DHFR protein levels had a mean total score of 2 and 4 in non-SQ of NSCLC patients. TS, DHFR, and GARFT mRNA levels had a median value of 5.55, 3.73, and 3.52 in MPM patients. TS and DHFR protein levels had a mean total expression score of 1 and 3 in MPM patients. No significant correlation was identified between the expression levels of TS/DPD/GARFT mRNA and clinical response for the non-SQ of NSCLC and MPM patients treated with PEM. CONCLUSION: TS, DHFR, and GARFT mRNA and protein expression may not be useful markers for predicting clinical response in Japanese patients with non-SQ of NSCLC and MPM. Further investigations are necessary in order to develop biomarkers to determine the clinical benefits of PEM treatment.",cancer
"Life stress due to losses and deficit in childhood and adolescence as breast cancer risk factor: a prospective case-control study in Kuopio, Finland. BACKGROUND: To our knowledge, the associations between the life stress due to losses and deficit at childhood and adolescence and the risk of breast cancer are rarely considered together in a prospective study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is an extension of the Kuopio Breast Cancer Study. Women with breast symptoms were referred by physicians to the Kuopio University Hospital (Finland) and were asked to participate in this study. These women (n=115) were interviewed, and all study variables were obtained before any diagnostic procedures were carried out, so neither the investigator nor the participants knew the final diagnosis of breast symptoms at the time of the interview. The research method used was the semistructured in-depth interview method. The investigator used the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) to evaluate the depression of the study participants. All participants were also asked to complete standardized questionnaires (Beck depression inventory and Spielberger trait inventory). RESULTS: The clinical examination and biopsy showed breast cancer in 34 patients, benign breast disease in 53 patients, and 28 individuals were shown to be healthy. The BC group had significantly higher mean score for the deficit in childhood than the BBD and HSS groups (p<0.05). The women in the BC group had almost significantly higher mean scores for the loss of social status in childhood than the women in the BBD and HSS groups (p=0.05). The BC group had also significantly more severe deficit in childhood than the BBD and HSS groups (p=0.02). The results indicated that breast cancer patients tended to have more life stress due to losses and deficit in childhood and adolescence than BBD and HSS groups. CONCLUSION: The results of this study support a weak association between life stress due to losses and deficit in childhood and adolescence and breast cancer risk. However, the biological explanation for such an association is unclear and it might be that stress due to losses and deficit impacts indirectly on breast cancer risk, affecting behaviour, or directly on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and autonomic nervous system functioning.",cancer
"Prognostic impact of microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer patients treated with adjuvant FOLFOX. BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients whose tumours have microsatellite instability (MSI) do not benefit from adjuvant 5-fluorouracil. However, the predictive value of MSI is not known for FOLFOX, now recommended in adjuvant setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: MSI phenotype was assessed by the pentaplex method. Three-year relapse and disease-free survival (DFS) of patients treated for CRC with FOLFOX 4 in an adjuvant setting were compared according to MSI phenotype. RESULTS: A total of 105 patients (19 MSI, 86 microsatellite stable, MSS) were included. Stage II patients more frequently exhibited MSI (58%) than MSS (21%); (p=0.002). Patients with MSI relapsed significantly less than those with MSS (10.5% vs. 35.0%; p=0.04). DFS was similar for MSI and MSS (p=0.1). In univariate analysis, stage (p=0.0006) and MSI status (p=0.017) were significant predictors of DFS. CONCLUSION: MSI status was associated with significantly fewer relapses and a better prognosis. FOLFOX4 did not alter survival of patients with MSI and can be administered to them.",cancer
"Clinical and molecular determinants of survival in pancreatic cancer patients treated with second-line chemotherapy: results of an Italian/Swiss multicenter survey. BACKGROUND: Increased knowledge about the treatment of pancreatic cancer has influenced the management of locally advanced and metastatic disease. Nonetheless, prognosis remains dismal (24%, 1-year survival). The impact on overall survival (OS) of second-line therapy has not been clarified and the use of platinum salts and/or fluoropyrimidines is hotly debated. It is the hope that future treatment can be tailored to predict chemosensitivity in order to improve outcomes in patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer. Since DNA-damaging agents could be one therapeutic option, a retrospective multicenter study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of salvage treatment with the hypothesis that levels of the DNA repair gene excision repair cross complementing 1 (ERCC1) could influence OS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a population of 160 patients treated with fluoropyrimidine-based second-line chemotherapy, expression levels of ERCC1 were determined by immunohistochemistry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In 108 patients with locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with either fluoropyrimidines and platinum salts (group A=58) or fluoropyrimidines alone (group B=50), ERCC1 levels were correlated with OS, time to progression and response to chemotherapy. RESULTS: Median survival was significantly higher in group A with low ERCC1 levels [11.9 versus 9.9 months; p </= 0.05] (median follow-up 24 months). Moreover in the same group, a trend towards longer time to progression was observed. No differences in OS were observed when ERCC1 was studied (low versus high) in patients not treated with platinum salts. On multivariate analysis of pretreatment prognostic factors, ERCC1 emerged as an independent predictive factor for OS. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that ERCC1 may predict survival in pancreatic cancer patients treated by platinum and fluoropyrimidine as second-line chemotherapy.",cancer
"Late metastasis of gastrointestinal stromal tumour to the oral cavity. This report describes the diagnosis and treatment of a metastasis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) to the oral cavity in a 64-year-old female, 14 years after treatment for a gastric primary and 11 years after partial hepatectomy for regional recurrence. The metastasis grew slowly in the buccal soft tissues and became symptomatic by intraoral extension. Positron-emission tomography combined with computed tomography depicted a solitary space-occupying lesion in the right buccal region with high standardized uptake values. Surgical exploration revealed a ball-shaped firm tumour mass adhering to the adjacent tissues that was completely resected. Subsequent healing was uneventful. Six months following ablative surgery the patient was in good general condition. There were neither signs of local tumour recurrence nor further distant spread. However, the patient is now under continuous medication with imatinib. GIST metastases to the head and neck region are very rare. Two recent case reports about head and neck metastases of GIST showed a predilection for bone. This metastasis was solely located in the oral soft tissues.",cancer
"Dual role of RASSF1 as a tumor suppressor and an oncogene in neuroendocrine tumors of the lung. BACKGROUND: Little is known about the dual role of RAS-association domain family 1 (RASSF1) gene at 3p21.3 in neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of the lung. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty typical carcinoids (TC), 11 atypical carcinoids (ATC), 11 large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNEC) and 16 small cell lung carcinomas (SCLC) were analyzed for RASSF1 promoter methylation, mRNA and protein expression, and loss of 3p21.3 locus. RESULTS: Promoter 1 was hypermethylated in NET but not in paired non-neoplastic lung tissues nor in 20 control NSCLC, with the degree of hypermethylation paralleling tumor grade. RASSF1 A/E isoform mRNA but not protein expression was lost in most NET compared to NSCLC or non-neoplastic tissues. The relationship between methylation level and mRNA or protein loss varied by NET type, with significant correlation for decreasing RASSF1 A protein in ACT, and marginal correlation for down-regulated RASSF 1 A/E mRNA in TC, this suggesting a non linear regulation by methylation in NET. No promoter 2 methylation was detected in NET; however, up-regulation of its RASSF1 C transcript emerged as an adverse prognostic factor in the LCNEC/SCLC group. A correlation was found between 3p21.3 allelic loss and decrease of RASSF1 A/E mRNA (p=0.023) and protein (p=0.043) expression in ATC, suggesting that 3p21.3 allelic loss contributed to the loss of gene expression. CONCLUSION: RASSF1 A/E is likely to act as a tumor suppressor gene in most pulmonary NET, and RASSF1 C as an oncogene in high-grade tumors.",cancer
"Atlanto-occipital ligament calcification: a novel sign in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. BACKGROUND: The nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS), first described by Gorlin and Goltz in 1960, is a hereditary autosomal dominant disease with high penetrance and variable expressivity. Almost 70% of patients with NBCCS have some degree of craniofacial anomaly. Among these, the presence of ectopic calcification have been reported but Atlanto-occipital ligament calcification has never been described. Therefore this investigation was carried out to determine the prevalence of atlanto-occipital ligament calcification on lateral x-ray of NBCCS patients aiming to assess the effectiveness of this sign in NBCCS diagnosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Lateral and frontal cephalometric radiographs of 18 patients (11 males and 7 females), aged 8-61 years, with the diagnosis of NBCCS were evaluated for the presence of intracranial calcifications (diaphragma sellae and falx cerebri) and or calcification of the atlanto-occipital ligament. RESULTS: A total of 11 patients presented calcification of atlanto-occipital ligament to various degrees and in three cases this represented the only sign of ectopic calcification. When compared to the other two sites of ossification, atlanto-occipital ligament calcification had a similar prevalence. CONCLUSION: The calcification of the atlanto-occipital ligament should be considered in addition to the other major criteria for NBCCS diagnosis.",cancer
"Assessing risk and mortality of venous thromboembolism in pancreatic cancer patients. BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with cancer. Cancer patient with thromboembolism have poorer prognosis. This study assessed the risk and mortality in pancreatic cancer patients who develop VTE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of 201 patients with pancreatic cancer. RESULTS: VTE was observed in 58 (28.9%) patients, 37/58 had deep vein thrombosis (DVT), 11/58 pulmonary embolism (PE) and 10/58 had both. Twenty-six out of 107 patients with tumor of head of the pancreas developed VTE (24%), compared to half of the patients with body of the pancreas involvement (11-22). Stage IV was defined in 99 patients, 39/99 had VTE (39%). Median survival time was 14.95 months for patients without VTE compared to 13.04 months with VTE. CONCLUSION: Patients with body of the pancreas and stage IV tumors had increased risk of developing VTE. There was no survival difference between patients with VTE compared to those without.",cancer
"Impact of tumor biology, particularly triple-negative status, on response to pre-operative sequential, dose-dense epirubicin, cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel in breast cancer. BACKGROUND: The central objective of this study was to determine the predictive impact of several established tumor biological factors (PgR, ER, HER2 and Ki-67) on response to pre-operative chemotherapy in primary breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 59 primary M0 breast cancer patients received pre-operative sequential dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel (19 patients at dosage 100 mg/m(2), 40 patients at 75 mg/m(2)). RESULTS: Pathological complete remission (pCR) occurred in 17 patients (29%) and at least partial remission in 42 (71%). Higher proliferation (Ki-67) and lack of hormone receptors (either or both) were significant predictive factors for pCR; moreover, 8/11 (73%) patients with triple-negative tumors (HER2(-)/ER(-)/PgR(-)) had pCR (p=0.001). Breast conserving surgery was achieved in 46/59 patients (78%). Hand-foot syndrome occurred in 12/19 patients treated at the higher docetaxel dosage but only 1/40 of the remaining patients. Higher docetaxel dosage was associated with improved pCR in the non-triple-negative subgroup. CONCLUSION: The tumor biology of hormone receptor-negative, especially triple-negative, and highly proliferating breast cancer is associated with strongly positive response to dose-dense, pre-operative epirubicin/cyclophosphamide/docetaxel chemotherapy.",cancer
"Use of paclitaxel for advanced ovarian cancer in clinical practice: analysis of 541 patients. Results from a German multi-centre observational study. Paclitaxel is one of the most common antitumour agents paclitaxel for the treatment of primary and relapsed ovarian cancer. Based on a German multicentre observational study, this article reflects the use of paclitaxel in German daily clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data for a total of 541 patients in Germany were analysed, including 315 patients with primary ovarian cancer and 226 patients treated with paclitaxel with relapsed ovarian cancer. RESULTS: The mean age was 61.2 years, ranging from 22 to 85 years. No unexpected toxicities were ascertained. In general, grade III/IV haematological toxicities were rare. Only 15% of the patients suffered from grade III/IV leucopenia and 5% from thrombocytopenia. Alopecia and polyneuropathy were the most frequent non-haematological side-effects noticed. Response evaluation was provided in 183 patients with primary ovarian cancer (CR 39.8%, of these achieved a complete response (CR), and 27.9% a partial response (PR), resulting in an overall response rate (ORR) of 67.7%. In 13.7%, stable disease (SD) and in 19.7%, tumour progression (PD) were documented. In 196 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, response evaluation was provided. A total of 28.6% of the patients achieved a CR, and 31.6% a PR, which produced an ORR of 60.2%. In 33.2%, SD and in 6.6%, PD were documented. CONCLUSION: Paclitaxel is broadly used in the management of patients with primary and relapsed ovarian cancer. The toxicity profile observed seems to be within the range of the results of clinical phase-III studies. The doses applied and the schedules based on the official recommendation of the working groups seem to have been influenced by international studies.",cancer
"Weekly chemoradiation (docetaxel/cisplatin) followed by surgery in stage III NSCLC; a multicentre phase II study. BACKGROUND: This prospective study analyzed the feasibility and efficacy of weekly concurrent chemoradiation (docetaxel/cisplatin) followed by surgery. The primary endpoint was radiological response. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six chemotherapy (docetaxel/cisplatin) cycles were administered on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29 and 36 with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy in fractions of 1.8 Gy, to a total dose of 45 Gy. Patients underwent surgery depending on results of invasive mediastinal re-staging. RESULTS: Forty-two out of 45 NSCLC stage III patients were evaluable. Nineteen patients showed partial/complete response (46%), 14 stable disease (34%) and eight (20%) progressive disease. Toxicity was mild. The 30-day postoperative mortality was 4.2%. Twenty-four patients (59%) proceeded to surgery and 20 (49%) underwent a complete resection (R0). CONCLUSION: Weekly concurrent chemoradiation (docetaxel/cisplatin) in stage III NSCLC results in a radiological response rate of 46% and mediastinal downstaging in 56%. Complete resection in downstaged patients was achieved in 49% of all patients.",cancer
"Concordant analysis of KRAS status in primary colon carcinoma and matched metastasis. KRAS somatic mutations are the main predictive factor for non response to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. We compared KRAS mutational status in the primary tumour and the corresponding metastases (1 to 4 sites) in 38 mCRC patients. KRAS mutational status was analysed using direct sequencing, SNAPShot multiplex PCR and Scorpion Taqman PCR analysis. Results showed 54% of primary tumours had KRAS mutations. A concordance of 97% between primaries and metastatic sites was observed. A tumour heterogeneity was also demonstrated in 5% of mCRC. One case with three different primary tumours harboured three different KRAS mutations, and only one was represented in the unique metastasis of this patient. We concluded there was a high concordance in the KRAS status between the primary tumour and metastases. More than one informative block and more sensitive assay may increase the accuracy of KRAS status determination.",cancer
L-type amino-acid transporter 1 expression predicts the response to preoperative hyperthermo-chemoradiotherapy for advanced rectal cancer. AIM: To evaluate whether expression of L-type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) in pretreatment rectal cancer biopsies is predictive of tumour response to neoadjuvant hyperthermo-chemoradiotherapy (HCRT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with rectal adenocarcinoma who received neoadjuvant HCRT were investigated. LAT1 expression was immunohistochemically evaluated using pretreatment biopsies. The operation was performed after 2-3 months following HCRT and each resected specimen was graded by the histological criteria of the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma. RESULTS: A positive LAT1 expression was recognized in 50.0% (22/44) of patients. Resected specimens were divided into 2 groups according to the histological grading criteria: good response (n=29) and poor response (n=15). LAT1-negative tumours had an 81.8% probability of good response and 18.2% probability of poor response. LAT1 expression showed marginally significant association with response to HCRT (p=0.05). CONCLUSION: LAT1 may be a useful predictive marker of response to HCRT in rectal cancer.,cancer
"EGFR-activating mutations are not present in breast tumors of Japanese patients. BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment, recurrent breast cancer remains a lethal disease. The epidermal growth factor receptor family has been suggested to play a role in breast cancer. However, no investigations of the frequency of EGFR mutation and the potential role of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in Japanese patients with breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor specimens were collected from 84 breast cancer patients who underwent surgery. Polymerase chain reaction-based methods were used to examine EGFR-activating mutations (exon 19 and 21). RESULTS: Activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR were not identified in any of the tumors. CONCLUSION: EGFR-activating mutations were not present in the Japanese breast cancer series studied here. Therefore, unlike lung cancer, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are unlikely to provide any benefit for Japanese breast cancer patients.",cancer
"Molecular predictors of combination targeted therapies (cetuximab, bevacizumab) in irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer (BOND-2 study). BACKGROUND: To test whether intratumoral gene expression levels and germline polymorphisms predict clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients treated with cetuximab and bevacizumab plus irinotecan (CBI) vs. cetuximab and bevacizumab (CB)(BOND2). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted for genotyping from 65 patients (31: CBI arm and 34: CB arm). Thirty five patients had tissue samples available for the gene expression assay (18: CBI arm and 17: CB arm). RESULTS: High intratumoral gene expression levels of EGFR, VEGFR2 and NRP1 were associated with longer overall survival (OS) in patients receiving combined monoclonal antibodies with or without irinotecan. FCGR3A V158F, CyclinD1 A870G and EGFR R497K polymorphisms are associated with clinical outcome in patients received combined cetuximab and bevacizumab. CONCLUSIONS: Intratumoral gene expression levels of EGFR, VEGFR2 and NRP as well as polymorphisms in FCGR3A, CyclinD1 and EGFR could predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients enrolled in BOND2, independent of KRAS mutation status.",cancer
"The joint effect of hOGG1 single nucleotide polymorphism and betel quid chewing on oral cancer in Taiwan. AIM: To evaluate the association and interaction among hOGG1 genotypic polymorphism, betel quid chewing status and oral cancer risk in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The well-known polymorphic variants of hOGG1, codon 326, were analyzed in association with oral cancer susceptibility, and discussed regarding its joint effect with individual habits on oral cancer susceptibility. In total, 620 patients with oral cancer and 620 healthy controls recruited from the China Medical Hospital were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: The hOGG1 codon 326 genotypes were differently distributed between the oral cancer and control groups (p=0.0266) and the C allele of hOGG1 codon 326 was significantly (p=0.0046) more frequently found in cancer patients than in controls. We further analyzed the joint effects of gene variants and habits on oral cancer risk and found an interaction between hOGG1 codon 326 genotype and betel quid chewing status. The association of the C allele for hOGG1 codon 326 with oral cancer risk was found to be significant only in the betel quid chewer group (p=0.0149), not in the non-chewer group (p=0.8028). CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that the C allele of hOGG1 codon 326 may have a joint effect with betel quid chewing on the development of oral cancer.",cancer
"Antitumour and cytogenetic effects of modified steroidal derivatives of propenoic acid: in vivo/in vitro studies. BACKGROUND: Modified steroidal derivatives (PK11-PK14) of p-bis(2-chloroethyl)aminophenyl propenate (PK15) were used to study their antitumour activity on Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) and their effect on sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and human lymphocyte proliferation kinetics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LLC was tested in this study. C57BL mice were used for in vivo chemotherapy evaluation and the antitumour activity was assessed. Lymphocyte cultures were used to study the genotoxic effect in vitro. RESULTS: PK15 and PK11 were the most effective against LLC, causing significant inhibition of tumour growth. PK11 and PK15 induced significant increase in SCE rates. A correlation was observed between the cytogenetic effect and the antitumour effectiveness. CONCLUSION: The order of the antitumour effectiveness of PK11-PK15 resembled the order of the cytogenetic damage induced by the same compounds in vitro.",cancer
"Inhibition of Myc effectively targets KRAS mutation-positive lung cancer expressing high levels of Myc. Myc is an oncogenic transcription factor that promotes tumorigenesis. Recently, a dominant negative form of Myc (Omomyc) was shown to cause regression of lung tumors in a mouse model of lung cancer caused by KRAS mutation, suggesting that Myc might be a potential therapeutic target to treat the KRAS lung cancer. However, it is not yet known whether Omomyc can also inhibit the growth of human lung tumors that carry a similar KRAS mutation. In the present study, we demonstrate that Omomyc induces cell death of KRAS-mutated human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells in vitro and in vivo. However, Omomyc does not induce cell death in human lung adenocarcinoma H441 cells that also carry the KRAS mutation. Interestingly, A549 cells express high levels of Myc, while H441 cells do not. Co-expression of exogenous Myc with Omomyc in H441 cells induces cell death, indicating that Omomyc requires high levels of Myc to induce cell death in KRAS mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma. Here, we show for the first time that KRAS mutation-positive lung cancer displaying high levels of Myc could be treated by inhibiting Myc transactivation function.",cancer
"The novel quinolone CHM-1 induces DNA damage and inhibits DNA repair gene expressions in a human osterogenic sarcoma cell line. 20-Fluoro-6,7-methylenedioxy-2-phenyl-4-quino-lone (CHM-1) has been reported to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in many types of cancer cells. However, there is no available information to show CHM-1 affecting DNA damage and expression of associated repair genes. Herein, we investigated whether or not CHM-1 induced DNA damage and affected DNA repair gene expression in U-2 OS human osterogenic sarcoma cells. The comet assay showed that incubation of U-2 OS cells with 0, 0.75, 1.5, 3 and 6 muM of CHM-1 led to a longer DNA migration smear (comet tail). DNA gel electrophoresis showed that 3 muM of CHM-1 for 24 and 48 h treatment induced DNA fragmentation in U-2 OS cells. Real-time PCR analysis showed that treatment with 3 muM of CHM-1 for 24 h reduced the mRNA expression levels of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1), 14-3-3sigma (14-3-3sigma), DNA-dependent serine/threonine protein kinase (DNA-PK) and O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) genes in a time-dependent manner. Taken together, the results indicate that CHM-1 caused DNA damage and reduced DNA repair genes in U-2 OS cells, which may be the mechanism for CHM-1-inhibited cell growth and induction of apoptosis.",cancer
"Up-regulation of fibronectin and tissue transglutaminase promotes cell invasion involving increased association with integrin and MMP expression in A431 cells. In human tumors, fibronectin (FN) expression is positively associated with tumor metastatic potential and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion. Additionally, tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is implicated as playing an important role in tumor progression, and acts as a co-receptor for integrin-mediated cell binding to FN. This study explored the involvement of FN and TG2 in cancer cell metastasis using the recently established highly invasive A431-III subline. A431-III cells expressed significantly higher levels of FN and TG2 as compared to the parental line (A431-P). Knockdown of endogenous FN by small interfering RNA (siRNA) resulted in dramatic suppression of the migratory and invasive activity, and the secreted MMP-9 activity (but not MMP-2) in A431-III subline. Exogenous administration of FN to A431-III cells also increased the secreted activity of MMP-9 but not MMP-2. Interestingly, knockdown of TG2 by siRNA dramatically reduced the cell attachment, migration and invasion, and the secretion of MMP-9 and MMP-1 (but not MMP-2 and MMP-3) in A431-III cells as compared to A431-P cells. Furthermore, A431-III cells exhibited increased association of integrin beta1 and beta3 with FN and TG2, and knockdown of TG2 markedly suppressed integrin beta1 interaction with FN. Together, this study suggests that FN and TG2 facilitate the metastatic activity of A431 tumor cells, and this may be partly attributed to TG2 enhancement of the association of FN and beta integrin. In addition, the combined targeting of TG2 and FN may be an effective therapeutic strategy for cancer displaying increased expression of both proteins.",cancer
"Differential suppression of proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells exposed to alpha-, gamma- and delta-tocotrienols is accompanied by altered expression of oxidative stress modulatory enzymes. Tocotrienols belong to the vitamin E family of chemicals known to have potent anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities against a variety of cancer cells with little to no comparable influence on the normal cells. Whether tocotrienols control the expression of phase II antioxidant enzymes in the context of their anti-carcinogenic mechanisms has not been investigated. The present studies were performed to test whether the differential growth inhibition resulting from exposure to alpha-, gamma- and delta-tocotrienols in estrogen receptor-positive human MCF-7 and estrogen receptor-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells might be accompanied by changes in phase II antioxidant enzymes. Cell proliferation and clonogenicity in both cell lines were significantly inhibited by gamma- and delta-tocotrienols with little affect when cells were similarly exposed to alpha-tocotrienol, at doses up to 10 muM. The expression and activity of several antioxidant enzymes in 10 muM tocotrienol-treated cells were determined by Western blot and biochemical assays. In MDA-MB-231 cells, delta- was more active than alpha- or gamma-tocotrienols in up-regulating glutathione peroxidase; however, the three tocotrienols had comparable activity in inducing thioredoxin. In MCF-7 cells, expression of quinone reductase 2 and thioredoxin was increased by gamma- and delta-tocotrienols, whereas quinone reductase 1 was unaffected by exposure to the tocotrienols. The tocotrienols also did not affect the expression and activity of superoxide dismutase in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, but increased catalase activity concomitant with slight reduction in the catalase expression. In MDA-MB-231 cells, treatment by tocotrienols led to several fold increase of NRF2 expression marked by corresponding decrease in KEAP1 levels. By contrast, no significant change in NRF2 and KEAP1 levels was observed in MCF-7 cells. These studies demonstrate that different tocotrienols show distinct and selective activity in regulating the NRF2-KEAP1, in coordination with the induced expression of cytoprotective oxidative stress modulatory genes and regulation of proliferation in breast cancer cells.",cancer
"Clinicopathological significance of p53, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND: The principal objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic significances of p53, hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The tumor tissues of 311 patients with colorectal carcinoma that had undergone potentially curative resections were immunohistochemically assessed using monoclonal antibodies against p53, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF. RESULTS: Positivity rates of p53, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF were 42.4%, 63.0%, and 56.6%, respectively. HIF-1alpha expression in tumor tissues was determined to be correlated significantly with the expression of VEGF (p=0.040), and depth of invasion (p=0.019). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that HIF-1alpha was independently associated with poor overall survival (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha expression is associated with VEGF expression and angiogenesis in colorectal carcinoma. Additionally, the expression of HIF-1alpha in tumor tissue is associated with angiogenesis and poor overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer.",cancer
"CRIM1 is expressed at higher levels in drug-resistant than in drug-sensitive myeloid leukemia HL60 cells. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore possible differences in the mRNA expression levels of CRIM1, SMAD5, BMP4 and BMP7 in sensitive (S) and multidrug-resistant (R0.5) myeloid leukemia HL60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HL60S and HL60R0.5 cells were exposed to daunorubicin (DNR) or cytarabine (Ara-C). RESULTS: Baseline levels of CRIM1 were found to be 15-fold higher in HL60R0.5 than in HL60S. Sixteen hours of exposure to DNR resulted in a 5.6-fold increase in CRIM1 levels in HL60S. Exposure to either DNR or Ara-C resulted in modest increases in CRIM1 levels in HL60R0.5. Similarly, baseline levels of SMAD5 and BMP4 were higher in HL60R0.5 than in HL60S cells. Analysis of the drug SMAD5-resistance marker permeability-glycoprotein (Pgp) revealed that CRIM1 and Pgp exhibit a covariance pattern of expression. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that CRIM1 is expressed at high levels in resistant leukemia cells, indicating that CRIM1 may play a role in drug-resistance.",cancer
"Real-time PCR: detection of oestrogen receptor-alpha and -beta isoforms and variants in breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Splice variants exist for both alpha and beta oestrogen receptors (ERs). Oestrogen function results from a balance between the wild-type ERs (wt) and their variants. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer samples were analysed by real-time PCR using ERalpha primer sets detecting wt and exon-deleted 3, 5, 6 and 7 variants. The ERbeta primer sets detected wt ERbeta1 and ERbeta2 and ERbeta5 variants. At the end of the PCR cycles, a dissociation curve was generated showing the peaks for each sample at specific melting temperatures (Tm); finding more than one peak indicated the presence of variants. RESULTS: Many samples expressed both wt ER isoforms and their variants. The Tm value served as a cut-off point for determination of wt versus variant ER expression. CONCLUSION: This method of detection of wt and variant ER could help in patient selection for anti-oestrogen therapy and in monitoring response to therapy.",cancer
"The joint effect of hOGG1 single nucleotide polymorphism and smoking habit on lung cancer in Taiwan. AIM: To evaluate the association and interaction among human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) genotypic polymorphism, smoking status and lung cancer risk in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The gene for hOGG1 was analyzed via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in 358 patients with lung cancer and 716 healthy controls recruited from the China Medical Hospital. RESULTS: The hOGG1 codon 326 genotypes were not differently distributed between the lung cancer and control groups (p=0.0809). However, the C allele of hOGG1 codon 326 was significantly (p=0.0198) more frequently found in controls than in cancer patients. We further analyzed the joint effect of genetics and smoking on lung cancer risk and found an interaction between hOGG1 codon 326 genotypes and smoking status. The hOGG1 codon 326 C allele-bearing genotypes were significantly associated with lung cancer risk only in the smoker group (p=0.0132), but not in the non-smoker group (p=0.06588). CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that the C allele of hOGG1 codon 326 may have a joint effect with smoking on the development of lung cancer.",cancer
"SLC34A2 as a novel marker for diagnosis and targeted therapy of breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to estimate the role of the SLC34A2 gene in breast cancer. A total of 146 samples were collected from breast cancer tissues and their adjacent normal breast tissues. Reverse transcription and real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to estimate gene expression levels. There was a significantly increased gene expression of SLC34A2 (normal tissues: 6.71+/-0.77; tumour tissues: 10.29+/-0.80) among breast cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. However, there was no significant association between overall survival and the gene expression level of SLC34A2. Moreover, a significant overexpression of CA125 (normal tissues: 7.26+/-0.62; tumour tissues: 10.51+/-0.58) in breast cancer tissues and a significant correlation between SLC34A2 and CA125 gene expressions were found. Our results suggested SLC34A2 to be involved in the development of breast cancer; this gene may therefore be a novel marker for the detection of breast cancer and act as a target gene in therapeutic strategies.",cancer
"Methylation of the TFPI2 gene is frequently detected in advanced gastric carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Recently, Glockner et al. identified the methylation of TFPI2 as a frequent event in human colorectal cancer using a gene expression array-based strategy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation status of the TFPI2 gene was examined in primary carcinomas and the corresponding normal tissues derived from 38 patients with gastric cancer using quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) and the correlation between the methylation status and the clinicopathological findings was evaluated. RESULTS: Aberrant methylation of the TFPI2 gene was detected in 7 out of 38 (18%) primary gastric carcinomas, suggesting that the methylation of TFPI2 is frequently observed in gastric carcinomas. The clinicopathological data were correlated with the methylation results. A significant difference was observed in maximal tumour size (p=0.0084), extent of tumour (p=0.0068), and TNM stage (p=0.0392). CONCLUSION: TFPI2 is frequently methylated in advanced gastric carcinomas.",cancer
"Overexpression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 gene correlates with poor outcomes in colorectal cancer. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) is a major endogenous regulator of matrix metalloproteinases. This study examined the relation between TIMP-1 gene expression and postoperative mortality in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Specimens of CRC were obtained from 202 patients. The relative expression levels of TIMP-1 mRNA in cancer and in normal adjacent mucosa were measured by quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The expression level of the TIMP-1 gene was categorized as low or high according to the median value. The TIMP-1 level did not correlate with any clinicopathological feature. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 5-year overall survival rate was significantly lower in patients with high TIMP-1 (62.6%) than in those with low TIMP-1 (80.6%; p=0.0113). High TIMP-1 mRNA expression was associated with significantly poorer overall survival on univariate Cox regression analysis (p=0.0013) and multivariate analysis (p=0.0070). Overexpression of TIMP-1 thus correlated with poor outcomes in patients with CRC. Our results suggest that the TIMP-1 gene expression level might be a useful, independent prognostic factor in CRC.",cancer
"Significance of keratinocyte growth factor receptor in the proliferation of biliary tract cancer. BACKGROUND/AIM: Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) has extremely poor prognosis because of rapid cancer cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to clarify the significance of keratinocyte growth factor receptor (KGFR) in the proliferation of BTC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of KGFR in 34 surgical specimens of BTC was investigated by immunohistochemical staining. The effect of Ki23057, a small synthetic molecule that interrupts the autophosphorylation of KGFR, on the proliferation of human BTC cell lines was examined in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The prognosis for BTC patients with KGFR-positive tumour was significantly poorer than that for those with KGFR-negative tumour. KGF significantly stimulated the proliferation of BTC cell lines. Ki23057 significantly decreased the growth of BTC cells in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: KGFR may play an important role in the proliferation of BTC. KGFR phosphorylation inhibitor, Ki23057, therefore appears to be therapeutically promising in BTC.",cancer
"Isomorph expression of BAG-1 gene, ER and PR in endometrial cancer. BACKGROUND: BAG-1 isomorphs are regulating proteins with antiapoptotic action in endometrium. ERa and PRA isomorphs seem to have an important role in endometrial cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We investigated the expression of BAG-1, ERa and PRA isomorphs in endometrioid adenocarcinoma and we correlated them with clinicopathological findings of the tumor. Fresh endometrial tissues were obtained from 33 patients with endometrial carcinoma and 191 paraffin-embedded tissues were analyzed by real-time PCR and immunochemistry for BAG-1, ER and PR. RESULTS: BAG-1 protein is expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm. Grade 3 tumors were considered to have the highest intensity. Only 4 out of 79 samples showed intense expression of ERa, while 37 samples out of 72 samples strongly expressed PRA. CONCLUSION: BAG-1 nuclear isomorph appeared more frequently in grade 2 tumors than in grade 1 and 3 tumors, and the cytoplasmatic isomorph was expressed more strongly than the nuclear one.",cancer
"Soluble MICB serum levels correlate with disease stage and survival rate in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Expression of ligands of natural killer group 2D (NKG2D) immunoreceptors, such as major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A/B (MICA/B), has been proposed to play an important role in tumour immunosurveillance. Soluble forms of MICA/B are increased in sera of cancer patients and are postulated to impair antitumour immune response by downregulating expression of NKG2D immunoreceptors. Serum levels of soluble MICA have been shown to be of diagnostic significance in malignant diseases. AIMS: The potential of soluble MICB (sMICB) as a marker for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was investigated. RESULTS: sMICB levels did not differ significantly from those in normal control individuals. However, the findings indicate that sMICB levels are significantly increased in stage IV OSCC and high sMICB levels are significantly associated with decreased survival rates in patients.",cancer
"Bacillus Calmette-Guerin and BCG cell wall skeleton suppressed viability of bladder cancer cells in vitro. AIM: Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is one of therapeutic options for urothelial carcinoma (UC). The objectives of this study were to determine the direct effect of viable or heat-killed BCG and BCG cell wall skeleton (BCG-CWS) on UC cells in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: UC cell lines were co-cultured with viable or heat-killed BCG Immunobladder(R) (Tokyo 172 strain) and BCG-CWS. Viability of the cells, apoptosis and BrdU incorporation were estimated. RESULTS: BCG induced cell growth retardation in highly malignant UC bearing integrin alpha5beta1 (VLA5). VLA5-blocking antibody partially abrogated this effect. BCG treatment induced a modest increase in the sub-G(1) fraction of cells and a decrease of BrdU incorporation. Cell growth retardation effect of viable BCG was reproduced by both heat-killed BCG and BCG-CWS. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that VLA5 may be a biomarker of UC with sensitivity to BCG. Moreover, BCG-CWS is a promising substance which might replace BCG, preventing life-threatening complications of viable BCG treatment.",cancer
"Evaluation of HER-2/neu gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in saudi female breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Amplification of the HER-2/neu oncogene and concomitant over-expression of its protein are detected in approximately 18% of invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast and is associated with poor prognosis. This study tested the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to evaluate the HER-2/neu gene status and to ascertain the concordance rate between the two methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty two tumour samples containing representative tumour were divided for testing using each assay. HER-2/neu gene amplification is scored as a ratio of HER-2/neu gene amplification to chromosome 17. The ratio should be >2.2 to be considered as positive. 20 cells should be counted and an average score taken. An extra 20 cells should be counted if the ratio is between 1.8-2.2. RESULTS: Seventy five effective samples were used. HER-2/neu gene was amplified in 19 out of 75 cases (25%) whereas, HER-2 protein, by IHC was over-expressed in 18 out of 75 cases (24%). In the 44 negative cases by IHC analysis only 7 cases (16%) of them showed amplification by FISH. Three out of 13 cases (23 %) scored as +2 showed gene amplification by FISH while 9 cases out of 18 cases (50%) were scored as +3. High concordance with FISH results 37:44 (84 %) was noted in negative cases (0/+1 cases), while lower concordance 3:13 (23 %) was seen in +2 cases. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a significant concordance between FISH results and IHC results. The study also showed that HER2/neu amplification is higher in Saudi patients than other western populations. However, due to the inherent failures of the IHC assay, FISH should always be used when the IHC results are inconclusive. The rational algorithm for HER-2/neu testing would be to perform IHC first, followed by FISH to validate equivocal IHC results.",cancer
"Gamma-secretase inhibitors induce erythroid differentiation in erythroid leukemia cell lines. BACKGROUND: Notch signaling regulates the fate of hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia cells. However, the role of Notch in erythroid differentiation remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined the effects of three gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI-IX, GSI-XII and GSI-XXI) that inhibit Notch signaling on the in vitro growth and differentiation of HEL and AA erythroid leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: GSI treatment induced morphologic erythroid differentiation and promoted hemoglobin production. GSI treatment suppressed short-term growth and colony formation, while treatment with GSI-XXI promoted the growth of AA cells. The degree of differentiation induced by each GSI roughly correlated with the reduction in HES1 mRNA expression. CONCLUSION: GSIs have potential uses in differentiation induction therapy for erythroid leukemia in the future. Before clinical use, in vitro sensitivity tests should be performed because the effects of GSIs are diverse depending upon the combination of leukemia cells and GSIs.",cancer
"Reversal of multidrug resistance in murine lymphoma cells by amphiphilic dihydropyridine antioxidant derivative. BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistance, the principal mechanism by which cancer cells develop resistance to chemotherapy drugs, is a major factor in the failure of many forms of chemotherapies. AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of K-2-11 on the reversal of multidrug resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of amphiphilic dihydropyridine derivative K-2-11 were tested on MDR1-expressing mouse lymphoma cells and their parental control. The effects of K-2-11 with and without doxorubicin were studied by determination of cell viability, cell proliferation and production of reactive oxygen species. RESULTS: K-2-11 caused complete reversal of multidrug resistance of the MDR cells, being much more efficient than the positive control verapamil. Accordingly, the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin were enhanced by K-2-11, both in the MDR and in parental cell line, while K-2-11 alone did not affect cell viability. K-2-11 also acted as an antioxidant, reducing the cellular generation of reactive oxygen species. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate the high potential of K-2-11 as a novel antioxidant with potent MDR-blocking ability that should be studied further for development in adjuvant anticancer treatments.",cancer
"Sodium butyrate with UCN-01 has marked antitumour activity against cervical cancer cells. AIM: The effect of combining sodium butyrate (NaB), a histone deacetylase inhibitor, and 7-hydroxy-staurosporine (UCN-01) on cytotoxicity in human cervical carcinoma cells was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HeLa and CaSki cells were treated using NaB alone or in combination with staurosporine (STS) or its analog UCN-01. Cytotoxicity was determined by flow cytometry and morphological assays. Apoptotic pathways were characterized by Western blotting and immunostaining. CaSki cells were also xenografted into nude mice to assess the in vivo effects of NaB/UCN-01 combination. RESULTS: Treatment with NaB and STS or UCN-01 resulted in enhanced apoptosis of cancer cells. Apoptosis involved mitochondrial pathways and overexpression of p53 and p73. In concordance, co-treatment modulated some p53/p73 downstream targets such as p21, BAX, BCL-2 and BCL-X(L), leading to increased caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. In vivo, NaB/UCN-01 combination exerted a substantial tumour growth suppression effect compared with single treatment. CONCLUSION: UCN-01 was shown to be a potentiator of NaB therapy for cervical cancer cells.",cancer
"Multimodality imaging and preclinical evaluation of 177Lu-AMBA for human prostate tumours in a murine model. AMBA (DO3A-CH(2)CO-G-(4-aminobenzoyl)-QWAVGHLM-NH(2)) is a bombesin (BN)-like peptide having high affinity with gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPr).(177)Lu-AMBA is currently undergoing clinical trial as a systemic radiotherapy for hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) patients. This study evaluated the biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, bioluminescent imaging (BLI) and microSPECT/CT imaging of (177)Lu-AMBA in PC-3M-luc-C6 luciferase-expressing human prostate tumour-bearing mice. Plasma stability of (177)Lu-AMBA could be maintained up to 55.67+/-6.07% at 24 h in a protection buffer. High positive correlations of PC-3M luc-C6 tumour growth in SCID mice between caliper measurement and BLI were observed (R(2)=0.999). Both the biodistribution and microSPECT/CT imaging in PC-3M-luc-C6 bearing-tumour mice showed that (177)Lu-AMBA in tumour uptake could be retained for 24 h. The distribution half-life (t(1/2alpha)) and the elimination half-life (t(1/2beta)) of (177) Lu-AMBA in mice were 0.52 h and 26.6 h, respectively. These results indicated that BLI could be used to monitor the growth of tumour. High uptake of (177)Lu-AMBA in PC-3M-luc-C6 tumour-bearing mice by microSPECT/CT imaging can further evaluate the potential of (177)Lu-AMBA therapy for PC-3M-luc-C6 tumours.",cancer
"Studies on combinations of platinum with paclitaxel and colchicine in ovarian cancer cell lines. Ovarian cancer remains an ongoing challenge because of the occurrence of resistant forms of tumour for which the drugs fail to function. Combination therapy using drugs with different mechanisms of action offer a means of overcoming drug resistance and reducing the side-effects. In this study, binary combinations of four platinum compounds cisplatin (Cs), oxaliplatin (Ox), YH12 [trans-PtCl(2)(ammino) {imidazo-(1,2-alpha)pyridine}] and TH1 [{trans-PtCl(NH(3))(2)}(2) {trans-Pt(3-hydroxypyridine)(2)(H(2)N(CH(2)) 6NH(2))(2)}Cl(4)] and two plant-based mitotic inhibitors paclitaxel (Tx) and colchicine (Co) have been used against ovarian cancer cell lines A2780 and A2780(cisR) using five different sequences of addition: 0/0 h, 4/0 h, 0/4 h, 24/0 h and 0/24 h. The strongest synergistic effect was observed when the plant compound (Tx or Co) was added first followed by platinum four hours later with combination index at 50% effect level (fa= 0.5) ranging from 0.03 to 0.36 and 0.10 to 0.72 in A2780 and A2780(cisR) cells respectively. Of all the platinum compounds, Cs showed the greatest synergism when combined with Tx and Co (combination index, CI(50)=0.03 in A2780 and from 0.10 to 0.12 in A2780(cisR)). With the sequence 24/0 h, platinum compounds showed greater synergistic effect with Co than Tx in A2780(cisR). With the sequences 0/4 h and 0/24 h, most of the combinations showed weak synergism to antagonism, especially in A2780(cisR). Antagonism was also observed when the two compounds were added simultaneously, especially in A2780(cisR). CONCLUSION: Binary combinations of platinum compounds Cs, Ox, YH12 and TH1 with plant compounds Tx and Co applied to ovarian cancer cell lines showed sequence- and concentration-dependent synergism. The results may have profound implications in therapy, if found to be true in vivo.",cancer
"Antiproliferative effects of rapamycin and celecoxib in angiosarcoma cell lines. BACKGROUND/AIM: Beyond their primary field of application some well-established drugs exhibit antitumour effects in a variety of cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the COX2 inhibitor celecoxib and the mTOR antagonist rapamycin on angiosarcoma cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell proliferation was measured in ASM, ISOS 1 and ISO HAS angiosarcoma cell lines with the BrdU assay. RESULTS: In all angiosarcoma cell lines, celecoxib as well as rapamycin inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. In ASM and ISOS 1, but not in ISO HAS angiosarcoma cells, additive growth inhibitory effects were detected by combining both agents. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that angiosarcoma cell proliferation can be inhibited by subtoxic doses of rapamycin and celecoxib. Due to their direct and stroma-mediated anticancer activities, mTOR antagonists and COX2 inhibitors represent very promising drugs in the palliative treatment of angiosarcoma.",cancer
"Curcumin-altered p53-response genes regulate radiosensitivity in p53-mutant Ewing's sarcoma cells. AIM: Curcumin has been demonstrated to have antitumor effects including radiosensitization by modulating many molecular targets including p53. Herein, we investigated the radiosensitizing effect of curcumin in p53 mutant Ewing's sarcoma (ES) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells exposed to radiation with or without curcumin were examined for transcriptional and translational levels of p53 downstream targets and its influence in regulated apoptosis, DNA fragmentation, cell survival and clonal expansion. RESULTS: Curcumin significantly caused radiation induced expression of p21 and Bax, and reduced BclXl, Mcl1 with only marginal Bcl2 modulation. As a positive control to the study, both transcriptional and translational levels of p53 remained unchanged after radiation with/without curcumin. Conversely, curcumin caused radiation-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation. Consistently, curcumin enhanced radiation-induced cytotoxicity and clonal expansion. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that curcumin potentially radiosensitizes p53-mutant ES cells by regulating IR-modulated p53-response genes. However, the curcumin-associated p53-independent regulation of downstream targets remains to be explored.",cancer
"PKCalpha/beta I inhibitor Go6976 induces dephosphorylation of constitutively hyperphosphorylated Rb and G1 arrest in T24 cells. BACKGROUND: Rb functions as a key controller of the G(1)-S transition of the cell cycle, and its inactivation leads to a defective G(1) checkpoint. Bladder cancer frequently displays alterations in Rb such as constitutive hyperphosphorylation which results in inactive Rb and progression of cells to the S-phase. Several protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors are currently undergoing clinical trials as anticancer drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: T24 urinary bladder carcinoma cells, known to express hyperphosphorylated Rb, were treated with PKCalpha/betaI inhibitor Go6976. The treated cells were subjected to cell cycle analysis, cell growth assay and Western blots for Rb and cdc2 phosphorylation. RESULTS: The treatment resulted in Rb dephosphorylation at Ser 795 and Ser 807/811, and cdc2 dephosphorylation at Tyr15. Subsequent G(0/1) arrest and reduced proliferation rates were observed. CONCLUSION: The results show that Go6976 can be used to restore constantly hyperphosphorylated and therefore constantly inactive Rb function in cancer cells.",cancer
"Evaluation of in vitro biological activity of O-alkylated hydroxamic derivatives of some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. AIM: Several published studies suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are promising anticancer agents. This study examined the in vitro effect of O-alkylated NSAID hydroxamic acid derivatives 3a-i on cell survival for a panel of human tumour cell lines, their cytotoxicity on normal human fibroblasts and their antiviral activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Established methods of cell viability testings, cell cycle analyses and Western blot assays were used. RESULTS: O-Alkylated NSAID hydroxamic acid derivatives exerted poor antiviral activity butreduced the viability of the studied tumour cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner showing low cytotoxic effect on normal fibroblasts. Compounds 3a and 3i were shown to be potent inhibitors of the growth of MIA PaCa-2 cell line. They induced p53-independent S-phase arrest and triggered caspase 3-dependent apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Two novel O-alkylated NSAID hydroxamic acid derivatives may be useful in the treatment of pancreatic cancer and should be further evaluated in vivo.",cancer
"Endocrine gland derived-VEGF is down-regulated in human pituitary adenoma. BACKGROUND: Endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF) is an angiogenic molecule restricted to endocrine glands and, particularly, to steroid-secreting cells. The expression of EG-VEGF and its significance in human adenohypophysis in physiological and pathological conditions is still unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we investigated by immunohistochemistry the expression of EG-VEGF in 2 samples of normal adenohypophysis and 43 bioptic samples of pituitary adenoma. Moreover, the expression of growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and adrenocorticoprophic hormone (ACTH) were also estimated. RESULTS: The results of this study for the first time demonstrate a down-regulation of EG-VEGF expression in human pituitary adenoma as compared to normal adenohypophysis, suggesting an impaired function of the neoplastic cells in terms of hormone release in the blood stream, as a consequence of impaired tumor angiogenesis in the tumor. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our data showing a marked decrease in the expression of EG-VEGF in pituitary adenoma, with the exception of LH-secreting adenomas, we suggest that LH might be involved in the induction of EG-VEGF secretion.",cancer
"Inhibition of GST-pi nuclear transfer increases mantle cell lymphoma sensitivity to cisplatin, cytarabine, gemcitabine, bortezomib and doxorubicin. PURPOSE: Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a chemoresistant lymphoma overexpressing the class pi glutathione-S-transferase (GST-pi). The nuclear localisation of GST-pi is induced by chemotherapy and is correlated to cell resistance. In this study, the effect of the Agaricus bisporus lectin (ABL), a GST-pi nuclear transfer inhibitor, on the chemosensitivity of MCL cells was investigated. METHODS: The proliferation of three MCL cell lines was evaluated in the presence of doxorubicin (DOX), cisplatin (CDDP), cytarabine (Ara-C), gemcitabine (GEM) or bortezomib with or without ABL pre-treatment. RESULTS: The cytotoxic activities of CDDP, Ara-C, GEM and bortezomib were increased in all cell lines. The DOX cytotoxic activity was enhanced in two of three cell lines. The inhibition of GST-pi nuclear transfer led to the potentialisation of all drug combinations. CONCLUSION: The inhibition of the nuclear transfer of GST-pi increases the MCL sensitivity to DOX, CDDP, Ara-C, GEM and bortezomib, alone or in combination.",cancer
"Effects of ILTG on DAPK1 promoter methylation in colon and leukemia cancer cell lines. AIMS: The aim of this study was to describe quantitatively the potential demethylating effects of the plant-derived compound isoliquritigenin (ILTG) on the death-associated protein kinase-1 (DAPK1) promoter region of colon cancer and leukemia cell lines. METHODS: Methylation-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction-melting curve analysis (MSP-MCA) was the primary method used. A simple cytotoxicity assay and an ethidium bromide displacement assay were used to evaluate the chemopreventive indices and account for any problems in fluorometric assessment caused by intercalating potential of the compound of interest. RESULTS: ILTG was able to affect the melting curve significantly when using MSP-MCA. ILTG exhibited a demethylating activity on HT-29 colon cancer and HL-60 leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: ILTG found in licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) may have the potential for being a cancer chemopreventive agent. From the specific assays performed in this experiment, ILTG appears to possess potential for development as a demethylating agent for either colon cancer or leukemia cancer prevention.",cancer
"A positive relationship between filamin and VEGF in patients with lung cancer. Induction of angiogenic responses by multiple factors, a crucial step in tumor growth and metastasis, is not completely understood. Recently, involvement of the cytoskeletal actin-binding proteins in angiogenesis has been suggested as a target for anti-neovascular cancer therapy in vitro. In this study, the expression of filamin A (FLNA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in paraffin-embedded tumor samples from patients with well-characterized lung tumors was immunohistochemically analyzed and compared with clinical variables and survival outcome. A positive expression of FLNA and VEGF was detected in the cytoplasm of tumor cells in 66 (48.2%) and 69 (50.4%) of the 137 patients with lung cancer, respectively (p<0.0001). A significant difference was observed between FLNA expression and VEGF expression. Although our findings do not suggest that the expression of FLNA alone plays an independent prognostic role, the angiogenesis pathway mediated by FLNA appears to be responsible for controlling the growth of lung tumors.",cancer
"Orthotopic fluorescent peritoneal carcinomatosis model of esophageal cancer. Aim: Orthotopic models utilizing orthotopic implantation have been used for developing cancer models of multiple tumor entities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of orthotopic injection in establishing a model of esophageal cancer using a human green fluorescent protein (GFP) cell line of human esophageal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nude mice were orthotopically injected in the abdominal esophagus with stably transfected GFP-PT1590 cells. Tumor progression was examined by fluorescence imaging. RESULTS: Fifty percent of animals developed extensive peritoneal spread without a distinct primary tumor at the injection site. Continuous and metastatic spread to the liver, lungs, and lymph nodes was also observed. Fluorescence imaging enabled fast and specific visualization of tumor progression without the need for anesthesia. Intraperitoneal and metastatic tumor spread of GFP-PT1590 esophageal carcinoma demonstrated a highly aggressive but heterogeneous behaviour. Although injection of the esophageal carcinoma cell line GFP-PT1590 did not lead to primary esophageal tumor development at the site of injection, 50% of the mice developed extensive peritoneal spread, as well as lymph node and organ metastasis. CONCLUSION: The orthotopic cell injection model resulted in peritoneal carcinomatosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma, which could be visualized in real time using fluorescence imaging.",cancer
"Second-generation substituted quinolines as anticancer drugs for breast cancer. Cancer cells have reduced capacity for gap junctional inter-cellular communication (GJIC). One feasible approach to reduce growth of cancer cells is to enhance GJIC. This report shows that a second-generation substituted quinoline, PQ7, has anti-tumor effect. Scrape load/dye transfer and colony growth assays were performed to measure GJIC and tumor formation of T47D breast cancer cells. PQ7 at 500 nM induced a 16-fold increase in the GJIC in T47D cells. In addition to an increase in GJIC, a 50% decrease of colony growth was observed with 100 nM of PQ7. PQ7-treated nu/nu mice showed a 100% regression of xenograft tumor growth of T47D cells. The results show that PQ7 has a promising role in exerting anti-tumor activity in human breast cancer cells.",cancer
"Methylation-mediated silencing of TMS1 in pancreatic cancer and its potential contribution to chemosensitivity. BACKGROUND: Resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, resulting in part from epigenetic silencing of pro-apoptotic genes, is one of the causes of treatment failure of pancreatic cancer. We examined whether epigenetic silencing of target of methylation induced silencing 1 (TMS1) contributes to resistance to chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation analysis was performed by methylation-specific PCR (MS-PCR) and gene expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). MIA PaCa-2 cells were transfected with pCMV6-XL5/TMS1 plasmid and the effect of TMS1 expression on sensitivity to gemcitabine and docetaxel was determined. Cell viability was measured using Cell Titer Blue assay. RESULTS: TMS1 expression was repressed in MIA PaCa-2 cells by DNA methylation. Up-regulation of TMS1 by recombinant gene expression in MIA PaCa-2 cells or by pre-treatment of these cells with 5-azacytidine resulted in enhanced sensitivity to gemcitabine and docetaxel. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that TMS1 is a potential therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer.",cancer
"Synergistic effects of topoisomerase I inhibitor, SN38, on Fas-mediated apoptosis. Inhibitors of topoisomerase I, such as camptothecin, have proven to be among the most promising new classes of anti-neoplastic agents introduced into the clinical setting in recent years. Irinotecan (CPT-11) is one of the most widely used camptothecin analogs and is converted to form the active metabolite SN-38. The present study was designed to explore apoptosis induced by SN38 and anti-Fas antibody (CH11) in WR/Fas-SMS1 cells and its possible mechanisms. The results demonstrate that combination of SN38 and CH11 synergistically enhanced cell apoptosis in WR/Fas-SMS1 cells. Western blotting analysis showed that combination of SN38 and CH11 activated the ATM-Chk1-p53 pathway, increased protein expression of phospho-p53 and cleavaged caspase-3, but down-regulated expression of phospho-p21. Our data suggest that combination of SN38 and CH11 enhanced apoptosis through down-regulation of p21 phosphorylation. In conclusion, inhibition of p21 could be a new adjuvant approach in cancer therapy.",cancer
"E-cadherin accumulation within the lymphovascular embolus of inflammatory breast cancer is due to altered trafficking. E-Cadherin functions as a tumor suppressor in some invasive breast carcinomas and metastasis is promoted when its expression is lost. It has been observed, however, that in one of the most aggressive human breast cancers, inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), E-cadherin is overexpressed and this accounts for the formation of the lymphovascular embolus, a structure efficient at metastasis and resistant to chemotherapy through unknown cytoprotective mechanisms. Studies using a human xenograft model of IBC, MARY-X, indicate that the mechanism of E-cadherin overexpression is not transcriptional but related to altered protein trafficking. By real-time RT-PCR, E-cadherin transcript levels in MARY-X were 3- to 11-fold less than in other E-cadherin positive human breast carcinoma lines but the protein levels were 5- to 10-fold greater. In addition, several smaller E-cadherin protein fragments, e.g. 95 kDa, were present. To explain these observations, it was hypothesized that there may be altered protein trafficking. A real-time RT-PCR screen of candidate molecules generally known to regulate protein trafficking was conducted. The screen revealed 3.5- to 7-fold increased ExoC5 level and 10 to 20 fold decreased HRS and RAB7 levels, which was confirmed in human microdissected lymphovascular emboli. Since these alterations may only be correlative with E-cadherin overexpression, one of the molecules, Rab7, was selectively knocked down in MCF-7 cells. An increase in the full length 120 kDa E-cadherin and the de novo appearance of the 95 KD band were observed. These findings suggest that it is the altered E-cadherin trafficking that contributes to its oncogenic rather than suppressive role in IBC.",cancer
"Androgen receptor-mTOR crosstalk is regulated by testosterone availability: implication for prostate cancer cell survival. BACKGROUND: Signaling between androgen receptor (AR) and mTOR may be crucial for prostate cancer cells to endure the low androgen and suboptimal nutrient conditions produced by androgen deprivation therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AR and mTOR cross-talk was examined in LNCaP cells exposed to either high or low testosterone. AR and mTOR activities were modified separately using either siRNA knockdown or specific chemical inhibitor. The biological significance of the reciprocal communication was assessed by susceptibility to glucose deprivation-induced cell death. RESULTS: AR positively regulated mTOR activity in both low and high testosterone levels. TSC1 and TSC2, the two negative regulators of mTOR, may be involved since both were up-regulated by AR knockdown. Sub-baseline mTOR increased AR protein levels. However, this effect only occurred with low testosterone. More cells underwent apoptosis if AR function was inhibited during glucose deprivation, which significantly depressed mTOR activity. CONCLUSION: The compensatory increase of AR function due to a repressed mTOR signal is advantageous for survival. Disrupting this loop at the time of initiation of androgen deprivation therapy may delay, or even prevent, the recurrence of prostate cancer.",cancer
"Inhibition of BCL-2 in small cell lung cancer cell lines with oblimersen, an antisense BCL-2 oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN): in vitro and in vivo enhancement of radiation response. BACKGROUND: Oblimersen, an ODN targeting BCL-2 RNA, has been shown to be effective in reducing BCL-2 expression in vitro and in in vivo models engineered to overexpress BCL-2. The present study evaluated the efficacy of combining BCL-2 ODN and radiation in small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The in vitro effect was determined using short term (cell viability) and long term (clonogenic) assays. Apoptosis, BCL-2 expression and intratumoural uptake of the FAM-ODN with or without prior radiation treatment were also evaluated. Combination of ODN and RT was also assessed in vivo. RESULTS: Radiation was shown to increase intracellular and intratumoural penetration of oblimersen, confirming previous results obtained in prostate cancer xenograft models. Oblimersen decreased BCL-2 protein expression in vitro and in vivo. BCL-2 ODN sensitised H69 cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. Oblimersen increased radiation-induced apoptosis and decreased in vivo tumoural vascularisation. CONCLUSION: Oblimersen was shown to increase in vitro and in vivo effect of RT on SCLC cell lines. Radiation increases intracellular and intratumoural penetration of ODN. This pre-clinical study argues in favour of clinical development in localised SCLC.",cancer
"Inhibition of Notch signaling reduces the stem-like population of breast cancer cells and prevents mammosphere formation. BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to be responsible for breast cancer formation and recurrence; therefore, therapeutic strategies targeting CSCs must be developed. One approach may be targeting signaling pathways, like Notch, that are involved in stem cell self-renewal and survival. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Breast cancer stem-like cells derived from cell lines and patient samples were examined for Notch expression and activation. The effect of Notch inhibition on sphere formation, proliferation, and colony formation was determined. RESULTS: Breast cancer stem-like cells consistently expressed elevated Notch activation compared with bulk tumor cells. Blockade of Notch signaling using pharmacologic and genomic approaches prevented sphere formation, proliferation, and/or colony formation in soft agar. Interestingly, a gamma-secretase inhibitor, MRK003, induced apoptosis in these cells. CONCLUSION: Our findings support a crucial role for Notch signaling in maintenance of breast cancer stem-like cells, and suggest Notch inhibition may have clinical benefits in targeting CSCs.",cancer
"C-index is associated with functional outcomes after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. PURPOSE: The C-index is a morphometric descriptor of renal masses that incorporates tumor size and site. We examined associations of the C-index with kidney function after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 131 patients who underwent laparoscopic partial nephrectomy for a single kidney tumor. We calculated the C-index from preoperative contrast enhanced computerized tomography images. Estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the modification of diet in renal disease 2 equation. Nadir estimated glomerular filtration rate was calculated using peak serum creatinine within 7 days of surgery. RESULTS: The median C-index was 2.7 (range 0.7 to 9.6). The median preoperative and nadir estimated glomerular filtration rate was 78 (range 23 to 148) and 54 ml/minute/1.73 m2 (range 15 to 127, p<0.001). The mean+/-SD total glomerular filtration rate decrease was 28%+/-16%. On univariate analysis we noted a positive correlation between log C-index and the nadir estimated glomerular filtration rate (r=0.29, p=0.002), and a negative correlation between log C-index and the percent decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (r=-0.4, p<0.001). On multivariate analysis the estimated glomerular filtration rate percent decrease was significantly associated with log C-index (p=0.005) and warm ischemia time (p<0.001) but not with tumor diameter or the preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate. Of patients with a C-index of 2.5 or less 70% showed a 30% or greater decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate vs 32% of those with a C-index of greater than 2.5 (RR 2.2, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The C-index is associated with the postoperative nadir estimated glomerular filtration rate and the percent decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. A C-index of less than 2.5 correlated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of a 30% or greater estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease after laparoscopic partial nephrectomy.",cancer
"A novel dithiocarbamate analogue with potentially decreased ALDH inhibition has copper-dependent proteasome-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activity in human breast cancer cells. Dithiocarbamates are a class of sulfur-based metal-chelating compounds with various applications in medicine. We reported previously that certain members of dithiocarbamates, such as diethyldithiocarbamate, disulfiram (DSF) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), were able to bind with tumor cellular copper to inhibit tumor growth through the inhibition of proteasome activity and induction of cancer cell apoptosis. Since the DSF is an irreversible inhibitor of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), its ALDH-inhibitory activity might potentially affect its usefulness as an anti-cancer drug. For the purpose of selecting potent anti-cancer compounds that are not ALDH inhibitors and mapping out preliminary structure-activity relationship trends for these novel compounds, we synthesized a series of PDTC analogues and chose three novel compounds to study their ALDH-inhibitory activity, proteasome-inhibitory activity as well as the cancer cell apoptosis-inducing activity. The results showed that compared to DSF, compound 9 has less ALDH inhibition activity, and the in vitro results also proved the positive effects of 9-Cu in proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction in breast cancer cells, suggesting that 9 as a lead compound could be developed into a novel proteasome inhibitor anti-cancer drug.",cancer
"A gene signature-based approach identifies thioridazine as an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in ovarian cancer cells. OBJECTIVE: Thioridazine, a derivative of phenothiazine, has been reported to have antiproliferative activity on tumor cells. However, the mechanism has not been well defined. METHODS: Using in-silico gene signature based approach, we have demonstrated that thioridazine could inhibit phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and thus exert cytotoxicity in ovarian cancer cells. RESULTS: The Connectivity Map indicated that thioridazine induces gene signature similar to that of Akt inhibition. Moreover, preexisting inhibitors of PI3K/Akt pathway were also found to reveal similar signature. In SKOV-3 cells, immunoblot using p85 antibody showed that thioridazine could inhibit PI3K signal. In addition, thioridazine was found to inhibit p-Akt (Ser 473) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, thioridazine was found to decrease cell viability and induce apoptosis. Exposure to thioridazine induced G(0)/G(1) arrest and down-regulated the cell cycle regulator, Cyclin D1 and CDK4, and up-regulated p21, p16, and p-CDC25A. Finally, additive cytotoxicity was observed when cisplatin and thioridazine were treated simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: The current study indicated that in-silico approach, such as Connectivity Map, is a potentially useful method to identify the unknown cellular function among the drugs already in use in clinic. Owing to the property of Akt inhibition and additive cytotoxicity observed with the platinum compound, further research should be focused on this drug.",cancer
"Interaction between preoperative CA-125 level and survival benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has survival benefit in selected patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who have high risk of suboptimal cytoreduction which is represented by high serum CA-125 level. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of 314 patients with EOC including 94 patients who received NAC. After stratification by preoperative CA-125 levels, the progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between the NAC group and the primary debulking surgery (PDS) group. RESULTS: The NAC group had more FIGO stage IV disease (P<0.001) and higher CA-125 levels (P<0.001). Although suboptimal resection rate was higher in the PDS group (50% vs. 18%, P<0.001), however, NAC was not associated with increased PFS in multivariate Cox analysis (P=0.334). Nevertheless, after stratification according to CA-125 levels, NAC showed survival benefit in the subgroup with high CA-125 levels (>2000 U/ml; HR 0.62, P=0.037). CONCLUSION: Our preliminary data suggests the possible interaction between CA-125 levels and survival benefit of NAC. The randomized trial data about NAC should be stratified by the reproducible and relevant criteria such as preoperative serum CA-125 level to elucidate true survival benefit of NAC in ovarian cancer.",cancer
"Application of hTERC in thinprep samples with mild cytologic abnormality and HR-HPV positive. OBJECTIVE: Amplification of hTERC is found to be an important genetic event in the progression from cervical dysplasia to cervical cancer. The hTERC value in predicting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), in high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) positive thinprep samples with atypical squamous cells (ASC) or a low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) was explored in this study. METHODS: A total of 300 thinprep cytology specimens (129 of ASC-US, 82 of LSIL, and 89 of ASC-H) with positive HR-HPV DNA was detected by a two-probe dual-color FISH panel, targeting hTERC and the centromeric region of chromosome 3 (CSP3). Using >2 signals for hTERC together with >/=2 signals for CSP3 to define abnormal nucleus, and the cutoff value was set at 6.5 per random 200 nuclei displayed increased hTERC signals and/or tumor ploidy. Statistical analyses were based on histologic findings of colposcopy biopsies, allowing CIN2 or worse (CIN2+) as the positive criterion. RESULTS: The FISH results were systematically analyzed among groups, based on histologic diagnosis, cytologic finding, HR-HPV viral load, and age status. hTERC presented good consistency with histology, and had satisfactory sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy among different groups, with less difference intergroup. The individual hTERC positive nuclei ratio was generally increased with severity of the cervical lesions. CONCLUSIONS: hTERC could be a stable predictor in assuring the risk of high-grade CIN in women with mild cytologic abnormality and positive HR-HPV, and the individual positive nuclei ratio of it might be helpful in identifying morbid grade for cervical lesions.",cancer
"The expression of the miRNA-200 family in endometrial endometrioid carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: Recent reports suggest that targeting the unique miRNAs highly expressed in several cancers may be a promising approach in the development of new cancer therapeutic tools. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the roles of miRNAs as therapeutic targets in human endometrial endometrioid carcinomas (EECs). METHODS: We evaluated the differential expressions of miRNAs in EECs and normal endometrial tissues using microarrays and cluster analysis. After validation of differentially expressed miRNAs in another set of EECs and normal endometrial tissues, we performed the in vitro experiment using endometrial cancer cells with anti-miRNA (anti-miR) to evaluate the roles of miRNAs that are highly expressed in EECs for cell proliferation and chemosensitivity. RESULTS: A miRNA microarray showed that the miR-200 family, including hsa-miR-141, hsa-miR-200a, hsa-miR-200b, hsa-miR-200c, and hsa-miR-429, was up-regulated in EECs as compared with that in normal endometrial tissues. When we treated endometrial cancer cells with specific anti-miRs, including anti-miR-141, -200a, -200b, -200c, or -429, we found that anti-miR-200a, -200b, -200c, and -429 significantly inhibited the growth of HEC-1A cells and anti-miR-141, -200c, and -429 significantly inhibited the growth of Ishikawa cells. Moreover, transfection with anti-miR-429 enhanced the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin in HEC-1A cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the miR-200 family is highly expressed in EECs compared with that of normal endometrial tissues and could play an important role in cancer growth. Specifically, anti-miR-429 could enhance the cytotoxic activity with cisplatin in EECs. Therefore, the miR-200 family may offer new candidate targets to be exploited in therapeutic strategies for patients with these carcinomas.",cancer
"Screening history in women with cervical cancer in a Danish population-based screening program. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the screening histories of all cervical cancers in a Danish screening population. The intention was to decide suboptimal sides of the screening program and to evaluate the significance of routine screening in the development of cervical cancer. METHODS: The study describes the results of a quality control audit, performed on all new cervical cancer cases diagnosed in the years 2008-2009 at two major Danish screening-centers. All relevant cytological and histological cervical samples were reviewed. RESULTS: 202.534 cytological samples were evaluated in the study period, while 112 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer. The histological diagnoses comprised: 62 (55.4%) squamous cell carcinomas, 20 (17.9%) microinvasive squamous cell carcinomas, 25 (22.3%) adenocarcinomas and 5 cancers of different histology. The mean age of study subjects was 46.6 years. 51 (45.5%) women had deficient screening histories, while 45 (40.2%) women had followed the screening recommendations and had normal cervical samples in review. 11 (9.8%) women were diagnosed with false negative cytology, 2 women had false negative histological tests, while pathological review was not feasible for 3 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: More than 45% of the cervical cancer cases in our study were due to deficient cervical screening, stressing the importance of increasing the screening-uptake and coverage. 40% interval cancers emphasize the relevance of further cervical testing of women with relevant symptoms, despite of prior normal cervical samples. Finally, 9.8% false negative cytological samples are consistent with previous reports, but still a part of the screening program that should be improved.",cancer
"Overexpression of gelsolin in human cervical carcinoma and its clinicopathological significance. OBJECTIVES: Cervical carcinoma is the second most common cause of death from gynecological cancers worldwide. Knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis of cervical cancer cell, except human papilloma virus infection, is limited. METHODS: A microarray was used to study the differential expression of genes in cancerous tissues to identify new molecular markers for diagnosis and prognosis. Their differential expression was confirmed with Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses. The clinical correlations and prognostic significance of the aberrantly expressed proteins were evaluated to identify novel biomarkers of cervical cancer. RESULTS: The expression of gelsolin was significantly upregulated in 78% of patients with cervical cancer, and gelsolin was selected for further study. Gelsolin expression was stronger in cervical tumor tissues than in the surrounding noncancerous tissues (P<0.001). Gelsolin expression in the plasma of cervical cancer patients was increased 2.2-fold compared with that of healthy control subjects (P<0.001). The levels of plasma gelsolin in the early and late stages were significantly different (P=0.006). According to immunohistochemical analysis, increased gelsolin expression was associated with histological type and FIGO stage II. The 5-year overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates for the low-expression group (cut-off=115) were significantly higher than those of the high-expression group. Cancer cells with reduced gelsolin expression exhibited reduced migration and proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide strong evidence that gelsolin plays an important role in cellular proliferation and migration in cervical cancer and suggest that gelsolin is a promising marker for cervical cancer screening and prognosis.",cancer
"Role of imaging in the preoperative staging of small bowel neuroendocrine tumors. BACKGROUND: Imaging studies are important in the preoperative staging of patients with small bowel neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and when selecting patients for cytoreduction procedures for metastatic disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of preoperative imaging compared with operative findings in the staging of small bowel NET. STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-four patients with small bowel NET undergoing laparotomy and who had preoperative imaging with combinations of CT, MR, and radionuclide scintigraphy were reviewed. Results of imaging studies were compared with operative findings to assess the ability of these investigations to detect mesenteric, peritoneal, and hepatic metastases. RESULTS: Mesenteric nodal metastases were seen on imaging in 47 (73%) patients and were present at laparotomy in 56 (88%) patients. Peritoneal metastases were seen on preoperative imaging in 4 (6%) patients and found at laparotomy in 16 (25%) patients. Hepatic metastases were seen on imaging in 42 patients (66%) and found at laparotomy in 49 (77%). Sensitivity and specificity for detection of hepatic metastases were 77% and 100% for CT, 82% and 100% for MR, 63% and 100% for (123)I-meta-iodobenzylguanadine scintigraphy, and 63% and 100% for (111)In-octreotide. Imaging studies failed to detect hepatic metastases in 7 patients and underestimated the extent of hepatic metastatic disease in 17 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Imaging of small bowel NET, even with combinations of CT, MR, and radionuclide studies, underestimates the extent of peritoneal, mesenteric, and hepatic metastatic disease. Accurate staging of small bowel NET might be best performed at the time of laparotomy.",cancer
"Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung in association with congenital pulmonary airway malformation. Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is a rare developmental abnormality of the lung that has been associated with the presence of rhabdomyosarcoma, pleuropulmonary blastoma, and most commonly bronchioalveolar carcinoma (BAC) of the lung. Here, we report the case of an 8-year-old patient who developed KRAS mutation positive stage IV mucinous adenocarcinoma of the lung in association with CPAM. This case reflects the previously recognized progression of CPAM to malignancy and suggests that BAC arising in CPAM may take a more aggressive course than previously recognized.",cancer
Endoscopic management of a type IV syringocele causing massive perirenal urinoma in an infant. The finding of a urinoma in the fetal and neonatal period is almost always related to an obstruction distal to the collection itself. Syringocele is a congenital or acquired dilation of a bulbourethral Cowper's gland. An exceedingly rare case of neonatal anterior urethral obstruction caused by a syringocele and manifesting itself with a dramatic clinical onset is presented. Clinical and radiologic findings are discussed and minimally invasive therapeutic strategies emphasized.,cancer
"Costal osteochondroma causing pneumothorax in an adolescent: a case report and review of the literature. Costal osteochondroma is a rare but important condition to recognize because of the possibility of serious consequences if not diagnosed and treated promptly. Patients can present with numerous complications, including hemothorax, pneumothorax, nervous or vascular impingement, and fracture. We report the case of a 17-year-old adolescent boy who presented to the pediatrician with intermittent shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. A chest x-ray demonstrated a left-sided pneumothorax and triangular opacity in the left chest. A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed the cause to be a costal exostosis of the anterior fifth rib. The lesion was excised using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which has become an increasingly popular method for treating these lesions, causing significantly less morbidity and allowing for a faster recovery than a major thoracotomy.",cancer

We report a case of intrabronchial schwannoma arising in the left main bronchus in an 8-year-old child. The diagnosis was made by bronchofiberscopic biopsy. Although the tumor was benign, the patient was subjected to left pneumonectomy because of destruction of the pulmonary parenchyma distal to the obstruction. The diagnosis of intrabronchial schwannoma was supported pathologically with characteristic findings on Antoni A and Antoni B areas. This case is unique in that it is the youngest case in the literature.",cancer
"American Pediatric Surgical Association New Technology Committee review on video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for childhood cancer. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Although the use of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques for children with cancer is being practiced by some, its role remains unclearly defined. The purpose of this review was to describe the current literature on MIS for thoracic and mediastinal lesions in children. METHODS: We performed a literature search for English studies that evaluated MIS techniques for biopsy or resection in children with suspected or established cancer. Only studies with greater than 20 patients were included in the review. RESULTS: Ten studies were included for review. Each represented institutional retrospective reviews of experience. Seven were single-institution studies, and 3 were multi-institutional. There were no prospective nor randomized identified. CONCLUSIONS: Based on primarily retrospective and observational data, the use of MIS for children with cancer who have pulmonary and mediastinal lesions seems to be effective and safe. Ideally, prospective studies are needed to evaluate this further.",cancer
"Impact of tumor viability at second-look procedures performed before completing treatment on the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group protocol IRS-IV, 1991-1997: a report from the children's oncology group. PURPOSES: The aims of the study were to compare results of clinical/radiographic studies before second-look procedures (SLP) with SLP specimens from patients with gross residual sarcoma at diagnosis and to relate tumor viability to outcome. PATIENTS: Seventy-three patients underwent SLP before completing chemotherapy, with (n = 59) or without (n = 14) radiotherapy. Tumor sites were bladder/prostate (n = 27), head/orbit/parameningeal (n = 22), extremity/trunk (n = 14), and retroperitoneum/pelvis (n = 10). RESULTS: Of 14 patients, 1 (7%) with clinical/radiographic complete response (CR) had viable tumor. Of 59 patients, 35 (59%) without CR had viable tumor. Five-year failure-free survival (FFS) rates were 81% in 37 patients without viable tumor and 53% in 36 patients with viable tumor (Cox proportional hazards adjusted P = .05). Five-year FFS rates were 67% in 15 patients with clear margins and 43% in 21 patients with tumor-involved margins (n = 18) or viable gross tumor (n = 3) (Cox proportional hazards adjusted P = .04). Five-year survival was 78% to 79% among 73 patients with and 333 patients without SLP during treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Second-look procedures can show whether viable tumor is present and may be beneficial in selected patients with rhabdomyosarcoma. Disappearance of tumor (CR) usually correlated with no viable tumor at SLP. However, 41% of patients without CR had no viable tumor. Those without viable tumor had increased FFS but not survival compared to those with viable tumor.",cancer
"Primary hepatic sarcomas in children--a single-center experience over 19 years. BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Primary hepatic sarcomas are rare and account for about 13% of primary hepatic neoplasms. There are few reported series of pediatric hepatic sarcomas, and the aim was to review our experience. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of cases managed from 1988 to 2007 by the pediatric liver unit in Birmingham, UK, was conducted. RESULTS: Nineteen children were identified. These presented with sudden abdominal pain (n = 6), obstructive jaundice (n = 3), incidental mass (n = 3), and chronic pain/distension (n = 3). Vascular involvement was identified in 3, and 6 had pulmonary metastases. Three patients had primary resection, and 3 only a biopsy. Thirteen had a biopsy followed by chemotherapy and resection. Surgery included extended hepatectomy (n = 11), hepatectomy (n = 3), and nonanatomical resections (n = 2). There was 1 major intraoperative complication. Median inpatient stay was 7 days. One biliary leak developed 4 weeks postoperatively. Five of the 16 patients who underwent resection of the primary tumor died. Eleven were alive at a median follow-up of 3 years. CONCLUSION: This is a challenging group of patients. Local control remains pivotal to successful treatment. Good results can be achieved in a specialist center with multidisciplinary approach.",cancer
"Diagnosis and management of biliary cystic malformations in neonates. PURPOSE: Recent advances in ultrasonography have made it possible to identify biliary atresia (BA) and choledochal cyst (CC) with biliary cystic malformations (BCM) both prenatally and neonatally. The early differential diagnosis between BA and CC is extremely important because operations must be performed as soon as possible before the livers of BA patients advance to an irreversible cirrhotic stage. The aim of this study was to differentiate patients with BCM and to determine the best course of management in the neonatal period. METHODS: The medical records of patients that were diagnosed with BCM by a prenatal or neonatal ultrasound between 1997 and 2008 were reviewed. We retrospectively divided the BCM patients into the BA and CC groups and then compared the results of ultrasound, computed tomography, and laboratory tests between the 2 groups. RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled in the study. The median age at the time of corrective surgery was 74 days (range, 24-206 days). All of the BA cases received an operation by the time they were 60 days old. In the BA group (5 patients), the mean cyst size was 15 mm, the mean direct bilirubin (D-Bil) was 3.3 mg/dL, and the mean total bile acid (TBA) was 138.1 micromol/L at 30 days of age, whereas in the CC group (5 patients), cyst size, D-Bil, and TBA were 40 mm, 0.9 mg/dL, and 46.9 micromol/L, respectively. These differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant. All of the patients with CC successfully cleared their jaundice, whereas 4 patients with BA subsequently required liver transplantation for liver failure. In our study, all patients with BCM less than 21 mm, D-Bil greater than 2.5 mg/dL, and TBA greater than 111 micromol/L in the neonatal period were diagnosed with BA. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggested that patients with BCM smaller than 21 mm, D-Bil higher than 2.5 mg/dL, and TBA higher than 111 micromol/L in the neonatal period were more likely to have BA than CC. This potential diagnosis should be surgically examined and corrected as soon as possible.",cancer

"Retropleural teratoma presenting as an abdominal mass in a 9-month-old boy. BACKGROUND: Teratomas are rare tumors that present most commonly in the anterior mediastinum and retroperitoneum. To date, the retropleural primary site has not been reported. CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-month-old boy presented with a large, painless, right-sided abdominal mass. Laboratory values, including tumor markers alpha-fetoprotein and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, were within normal limits. Diagnostic imaging, including abdominal ultrasound, computed tomographic scan, and magnetic resonance imaging, suggested a large retroperitoneal mass consistent with a teratoma. Because the mass was thought to be arising from the retroperitoneum, an abdominal approach was chosen. After adequate exposure, it became clear that the tumor was arising from above the diaphragm. The diaphragm was incised, and the pleural cavity was entered. The tumor was found in the retropleural space where it was dissected away from the inferior vena cava, aorta, and chest wall. The patient recovered without complications. RESULTS: Histologic examination revealed a mature cystic teratoma with no malignant features. The patient has been disease-free at 7-year follow-up, based upon both clinical examination and diagnostic imaging. CONCLUSION: This is the first case report of a teratoma arising from the retropleural space. Preoperative imaging may be inaccurate for guiding surgical planning because the diaphragm may not be clearly visualized with current diagnostic techniques. Surgeons should be cautious regarding the location of tumors that arise near the diaphragm and should plan surgical resection carefully.",cancer

"Centchroman mediated apoptosis involves cross-talk between extrinsic/intrinsic pathways and oxidative regulation. AIMS: Centchroman (CC) has been established as a potent antineoplastic agent in MCF-7 (ER+ve) and MDA MB-231 (ER-ve) Human Breast Cancer Cells (HBCCs) previously by us. To elucidate its antineoplastic action, we investigated the factors involved in cell-cycle progression and apoptosis. MAIN METHODS: Tamoxifen (TAM), a widely used antiestrogen was employed as a positive control. Role of Cycloheximide (CHX), Actinomycin-D (Act-D) and caspases were explored using specific inhibitors. Involvement of cell-cycle and apoptosis related factors were explored using western blotting and immunoprecipitation. KEY FINDINGS: Metabolic inhibitors viz. CHX, Act-D and pan-Caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK attenuated CC-induced apoptosis. The upregulation of both p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) along with p21-CDK6 (Cyclin Dependent Kinase 6) and p21-PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) interaction suggests their role in CC-induced cell-cycle arrest. The downregulation of Cyclin-D(1) and -E levels further confirms the antiestrogenic profile of CC. Unlike MDA MB-231, in MCF-7 cells, CC upregulates the level of phospho-p53 (Ser-15) and FasL, suggesting the involvement of extrinsic pathway. CC altered the intracytosolic balance of members of Bcl-2 family along with the cleavage of Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), Bcl-X(L), Bid and AIF (Apoptosis Inducing Factor). The evaluation of Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) using specific inhibitors and Western blotting confirms CC-induced the upregulation of phospho-c-Jun and phospho-p38. Additionally elevated SOD (Superoxide Dismutase) and unaltered CAT (Catalase) expression further suggest the involvement of oxidative stress. SIGNIFICANCE: These results confirm that the antineoplasticity of CC in MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells involves the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis along with oxidative stress.",cancer
"MDM2 promotes cell motility and invasiveness through a RING-finger independent mechanism. Recent studies connect MDM2 with increased cell motility, invasion and/or metastasis proposing an MDM2-mediated ubiquitylation-dependent mechanism. Interestingly, in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) p53/MDM2 co-expression is associated with reduced survival which is independently linked with metastasis. We therefore investigated whether expression of p53 and/or MDM2 promotes aggressive cell phenotypes. Our data demonstrate that MDM2 promotes increased motility and invasiveness in RCC cells (N.B. similar results are obtained in non-RCC cells). This study shows for the first time both that endogenous MDM2 significantly contributes to cell motility and that this does not depend upon the MDM2 RING-finger, i.e. is independent of ubiquitylation (and NEDDylation). Our data suggest that protein-protein interactions provide a likely mechanistic basis for MDM2-promoted motility which may constitute future therapeutic targets.",cancer
"Induction of gastric cancer cell adhesion through transforming growth factor-beta1-mediated peritoneal fibrosis. BACKGROUND: Peritoneal dissemination is one of the main causes of death in gastric cancer patients. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), one of the most potent fibrotic stimuli for mesothelial cells, may play a key role in this processing. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the effects of TGF-beta1 on regulation of gastric cancer adhesion to mesothelial cells. METHODS: Peritoneal tissues and peritoneal wash fluid were obtained for hematoxylin and eosin staining or ELISA to measure fibrosis and TGF-beta1 levels, respectively. The peritoneal mesothelial cell line, HMrSV5, was used to determine the role of TGF-beta1 in regulation of gastric cancer cell adhesion to mesothelial cells and expression of collagen, fibronectin, and Smad 2/3 by using adhesion assay, western blot, and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The data showed that TGF-beta1 treatment was able to induce collagen III and fibronectin expression in the mesothelial cells, which was associated with an increased adhesion ability of gastric cancer cells, but knockdown of minimal sites of cell binding domain of extracellular matrix can partially inhibit these effects. CONCLUSION: Peritoneal fibrosis induced by TGF-beta1 may provide a favorable environment for the dissemination of gastric cancer.",cancer
"Synthesis and biological evaluation of Apogossypolone derivatives as pan-active inhibitors of antiapoptotic B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) family proteins. Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins is commonly related with tumor maintenance, progression, and chemoresistance. Inhibition of these antiapoptotic proteins is an attractive approach for cancer therapy. Guided by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) binding assays, a series of 5,5' substituted compound 6a (Apogossypolone) derivatives was synthesized and identified pan-active antagonists of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, with binding potency in the low micromolar to nanomolar range. Compound 6f inhibits the binding of BH3 peptides to Bcl-X(L), Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 with IC(50) values of 3.10, 3.12, and 2.05 muM, respectively. In a cellular assay, 6f potently inhibits cell growth in several human cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 6f further displays in vivo efficacy in transgenic mice and demonstrated superior single-agent antitumor efficacy in a PPC-1 mouse xenograft model. Together with its negligible toxicity, compound 6f represents a promising drug lead for the development of novel apoptosis-based therapies for cancer.",cancer
"Squamous cell carcinoma secondary to Buruli ulcer: a clinical case report in a young girl. Buruli Ulcer, a common tropical disease, is endemic in West Africa in particular in Cote d'Ivoire, where it represents the second mycobacterial disease after Tuberculosis. The late diagnosis and treatment as well as, the lack of surveillance, lead to large skin ulcerations, local or multifocal osteomylitis and some time it may lead to neoplasia which contribute to worse the prognosis of the patient. We presented a case report in a girl of 16 years old, who died from an aggressive squamous cell carcinoma of the upper limb secondary to Buruli Ulcer. This case report showed the importance of early detection and treatment, a specific surveillance for Buruli Ulcer infected patients, a need for them to be vigilant and to report any suspected skin lesions even after healing, and the need for a good prevention strategy in Buruli Ulcer endemic areas.",cancer
"Protection of ovarian tissue from radiotherapy. Advances researches in the diagnosis and treatment of childhood, adolescent and adult cancer have greatly increased the life expectancy of premenopausal women with cancer. However, one of the serious side effects of these treatments is the risk of damage to fertility. The ovaries are very sensitive to cytotoxic and radiotherapeutic treatment. The only established method of fertility preservation is embryo cryopreservation according to the Ethics Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2005), but this option requires the patient to be of pubertal age, have a partner or use donor sperm, and be able to undergo a cycle of ovarian stimulation, which is not possible when the radiotherapy has to be initiated immediately or when stimulation is contraindicated according to the type of cancer. For patients who need immediate radiotherapy, cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is the only possible alternative. This manuscript reports the different techniques of cryopreservation and the results of transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue. The current techniques allow cryopreservation of human ovarian fragments for a long time with good follicular survival rate after thawing. Numerous studies ultimately in this field have demonstrated to improve the survival rate of the oocytes and cryopreserved follicles. Moreover this manuscript includes a case of a 17-year-old girl who had to undergo pelvic irradiation for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and the laparoscopic treatment to preserve the fertility (Fig. 2, Ref. 47).",cancer
"Specificity and sensitivity of differentiation antigens in superficial soft tissue tumors: comparison of SMA, calponin, H-caldesmon, C-kit, PLAP and HPL. We examined the expression pattern of smooth muscle actin (SMA), h-caldesmon (HCD), calponin (CALP), placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) and human placental lactogen (HPL) in benign and malignant spindle cell superficial soft tissue tumors in order to determine the role of these markers in differential diagnosis. Archival tissue from 38 patients with superficial smooth muscle cell and so-called fibrohistiocytic tumors (8 benign fibrous histiocytomas (BFHs), 6 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFPT), 9 malignant fibrous histiocytomas (MFHs), 9 leiomyomas (LMs) and 6 leiomyosarcomas (LMSs)) were immunostained with antibodies against SMA, HCD, CALP, PLAP and HPL. smooth muscle cell (SMC) tumors showed significantly high immunopositivity for HCD than that of so-called fibrohistiocytic tumors (p is less than or equal to 0.05) but 1/3 of DFPT and MFH cases and half of BFH cases also showed HCD immunopositivity; thus, this difference is debatable and not highly discriminative as expected. All tumor groups showed 100% immunopositivity for CALP. SMC tumors displayed significantly stronger and more widespread immunostaining pattern for PLAP than so-called fibrohistiocytic tumors (p < 0.05). Superficial soft tissue tumors did not express c-kit. In conclusion, HCD and PLAP can be used as ancillary immunomarkers in differential diagnosis of SMC tumors (Tab. 2, Fig. 7, Ref. 37).",cancer
"Recent epidemiological results of thyroid cancer in the most radiated territory in Poland. In this report the authors evaluate epidemiological evidence of thyroid cancer cases in a highly radiated territory in Poland--i.e. in the province of Opole after 1986. The analysis - based on logistic regression modelling of registered thyroid cancer and an ecological covariate (137Cs concentration)--shows differences in incidence in six distinguished radiation zones and two equal periods. The results of this study indicate a significant increase in incidence of thyroid cancer in 1995-2002 in males and in females comparing to the years 1987-1994. Moreover, a considerable rise of incidences has been noticed in the elevated isotope's concentration zones in females across the province in the analyzed periods. The data comprises all the thyroid cancer cases registered in Opole province in the years 1987-2002. The data originated from the Provincial Cancer Registry in Opole. The information on 137Cs concentrations was derived from the Polish Geological Institute in Warsaw. The computation was performed using WinBUGS software.",cancer

"The skin cancer prevention framework: a comprehensive tool for population-level efforts in skin cancer. The Skin Cancer Prevention Team (SCPT) required a comprehensive approach for guiding its efforts in population-level skin cancer prevention. After identifying and reviewing several models, it concluded that an appropriate population-level model applicable to the Alberta context did not exist. Thus, the SCPT, under the Alberta Health Services - Cancer Prevention Program, developed and evaluated a model for Alberta. Three inclusion criteria for a comprehensive framework were identified: 1) use an ecological approach to population health; 2) function as a dynamic tool for planning, implementing and evaluating population-level efforts; and 3) address weaknesses in existing theory in population health and health promotion. Theoretical constructs were layered together, on the basis of the criteria, to develop an omnibus framework. The resulting Framework represents a layering of several constructs used in popular health promotion and population health theories. It merges principles of the realist approach to scientific enquiry with principles of ecological theory. The Framework outlines a three-step, dynamic process for planning, implementing and evaluating population-level efforts. It also provides insight into the larger, unifying influences for changes in health outcomes and the complex mechanisms of behaviour change processes at the population level.",cancer
"Burden of malignancy after a primary skin cancer: recurrence, multiple skin cancers and second primary cancers. The current paper summarizes relevant recent research on the high risk of recurrence, multiple skin cancers and second primary cancers in the growing number of people with a history of skin cancer; the ultimate purpose is to better assess the burden of malignancy following skin cancer. A number of challenges exist in identifying and tracking both melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) cases. Most jurisdictions do not routinely track NMSC cases and, even if they do, it is customary to only include the first diagnosis. There are variable rules for counting multiple melanoma cancers, and recurrences are not considered for either major type of skin cancer. Applying insights from recent studies of this issue to Canadian cancer statistics would increase reported diagnoses of NMSC by about 26% and melanoma by 10% in this country. This approach to a fuller assessment of the burden of skin cancers has been called a ""diagnosis-based incidence approach"" as compared with a ""patient-based incidence approach"". A further issue that is not usually taken into account when assessing the burden of skin cancers is the 20% to 30% elevated risk of noncutaneous second primary cancers following a primary skin tumour. In summary, individuals with skin cancer are subject to a high risk of recurrence, multiple skin cancers and second primary cancers. This burden should be a special concern in the large and growing pool of individuals with a history of skin cancer, as well as among prevention planners.",cancer
"The Second National Sun Survey: overview and methods. The Second National Sun Survey (NSS2) was carried out in 2006 to estimate ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, sun protection and related knowledge, attitudes and beliefs among Canadians. This paper provides a detailed overview of NSS2 methods and discusses the strengths and limitations of the survey. The NSS2 consists of two questionnaires administered to two samples of adults (age 16+ years). The base sample provides in-depth information on UVR exposure, protective behaviours, tanning, and knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about sun safety for adults, as well as some sun behaviour information for a sample of their children aged 1-12 years. The shorter comparison sample facilitates direct comparison with the 1996 first national sun survey. Data were collected using computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and sample weights were computed for all respondents for estimation and analysis of both adult and child data. Base sample interviews were completed for 7,121 adults, of whom 1,437 reported on the sun behaviour of one of their children, and the comparison sample yielded 2,115 interviews. Response rates were 63% for both surveys. The NSS2 provides in-depth and up-to-date UVR exposure information among Canadians. The results of this survey will aid health promotion experts and policy-makers in developing effective programs to minimize UVR exposure. A public use data file and training in statistical analysis of the NSS2 has been made available to data analysts from across Canada. Key strengths and limitations identified in this survey will inform the development and implementation of future sun surveys.",cancer
"The UV index: definition, distribution and factors affecting it. The UV Index was introduced in Canada in 1992 in response to growing concerns about the potential increase of ultraviolet (UV) radiation due to ozone depletion. The index was adopted as a standard indicator of UV levels by the World Meteorological Organization and World Health Organization in 1994. This survey article gives an overview of the UV Index and the main features of its geographical distribution. UV index values are determined from measurements made by ground-based spectrometers, broad-band filter radiometers and multi-filter radiometers. Radiative transfer models are used to estimate UV Index values from other types of geophysical observations, primarily column ozone and cloud thickness. UV Index values can also be retrieved from satellite measurements of atmospheric ozone and cloud cover. Forecasts of UV Index values are now widely available and are intended to be used by the public as a guide to avoid excessive exposure to UV radiation. Over the US and Canada, mean noontime UV Index values in summer range from 1.5 in the Arctic to 11.5 over southern Texas and can be as high as 20 at high elevations in Hawaii. The UV Index is also often used to quantify UV levels in studies investigating the impact of UV on other biological and photochemical processes. Factors affecting the UV Index, such as the sun elevation, total amount of ozone in the atmosphere, cloud cover, reflection from snow and local pollution, are also discussed. Since its introduction in 1992, the UV Index has become a widely used parameter to characterize solar UV. Information about it can be useful for helping people avoid excessive levels of UV radiation.",cancer
"Electrochemotherapy (ECT), a local therapy, has different effectiveness among tumor types. In breast cancer, its effectiveness is low; therefore, combined therapies are needed. The aim of our study was to combine ECT with PARP inhibitor olaparib, which could inhibit the repair of bleomycin or cisplatin induced DNA damage and potentiate the effectiveness of ECT. The effects of combined therapy were studied in BRCA1 mutated (HCC1937) and non-mutated (HCC1143) triple negative breast cancer cell lines. Therapeutic effectiveness was studied in 2D and 3D cell cultures and in vivo on subcutaneous HCC1937 tumor model in mice. The underlying mechanism of combined therapy was determined with the evaluation of gammaH2AX foci. Combined therapy of ECT with bleomycin and olaparib potentiated the effectiveness of ECT in BRCA1 mutated HCC1937, but not in non-mutated HCC1143 cells. The combined therapy had a synergistic effect, which was due to the increased number of DNA double strand breaks. Addition of olaparib to ECT with bleomycin in vivo in HCC1937 tumor model had only minimal effect, indicating repetitive olaparib treatment would be needed. This study demonstrates that DNA repair inhibiting drugs, like olaparib, have the potential to increase the effectiveness of ECT with bleomycin.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Xerostomia is one of the multidimensional effects of cancer therapy that can impact on patients' quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the reliability and validity properties of the xerostomia questionnaire. METHODS: The data were retrieved from a randomized, interventional and longitudinal follow-up study of 72 head and neck cancer patients on active oral radiotherapy. Data were retrieved by the Xerostomia Questionnaire, the EORTC-QLQ C30 and EORT QLQ HN35. Data analyzes included intrinsic credibility of affinity Cronbach alpha factor, which is related to validity and cross-sectional validity. RESULTS: The Cronbach's alpha index of the Greek version of the questionnaire was high. Explicitly, the total scale of the questionnaire had an alpha = 0.97, and the individual dimensions - Degree of dryness and the quality of life had an alpha of 0.97 and 0.98 respectively. The xerostomia dimension of the questionnaire has a high positive correlation with QLQ C30 overall (r = 0.61, p < 0.001), and with the HN35 xerostomia dimension (r = 0.63, p < 0.001) which demonstrate its' concurrent validity. The dimensions of the xerostomia questionnaire were highly correlated with the EORTC-QLQ C30 dimensions which supports its' predictive validity. The level of xerostomia and the quality of life varied according to the level of pain of the patients (p < 0.001) that support the cross-sectional validity of the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The Greek version of the xerostomia questionnaire is a reliable and valid tool for use in head and neck cancer patients on active oral radiotherapy.",nocancer
"In recent times, the development of functionalized nanoparticle methodology for biomedical applications has become a major challenge. In the present study, we prepared a novel gold nanoparticle (AuNP), named Curto-Cumin AuNP (CC-AuNP), using the biosynthetic process involving Nigella sativa (black cumin) seed extract and membrane vesicles isolated from the novel probiotic strain, Curtobacterium proimmune K3. Various spectrometric and microscopic analyses were performed to characterize the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles. CC-AuNP exhibited significant cytotoxicity against human gastric adenocarcinoma (AGS) cells but not against normal cells. The toxic effects of the nanoparticles were associated with the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in damaged mitochondria. Further, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytotoxic effect of CC-AuNP. Results showed that except for B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), the intracellular apoptotic signaling molecules, such as p53, Bcl-associated X protein (Bax), and Caspase 9/Caspase 3 were significantly upregulated in AGS cells. ROS production and alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential were observed in AGS cells treated with CC-AuNP. The activation of autophagy flux-related biomarkers, such as LC3b/a, Beclin-1, p62, and Caspase 8, was confirmed by qPCR and western blotting. Autophagy pathway was suppressed in CC-AuNP-treated AGS cells and could not proceed further to the mature state. This was confirmed by the evaluation of both apoptosis and autophagy signaling pathways using autophagy-induced AGS cells treated with rapamycin, a well-studied autophagy activator. Overall, our results showed that CC-AuNP upregulates apoptotic signaling and suppresses the autophagy-related signaling pathway, and thus has potential as an anticancer agent. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that CC-AuNP may serve as novel therapeutic agent against gastric cancer. Furthermore, our study provides preliminary data which can be used to develop novel anticancer candidates and understand their anticancer mechanisms, and seems to be a good starting point for the development of alternative medications based on CC-AuNP.",nocancer
"Conjugation of small molecules such as lipids or receptor ligands to anti-cancer drugs has been used to improve their pharmacological properties. In this work, we studied the biological effects of several small-molecule enhancers into a short oligonucleotide made of five floxuridine units. Specifically, we studied adding cholesterol, palmitic acid, polyethyleneglycol (PEG 1000), folic acid and triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) as potential enhancers of cellular uptake. As expected, all these molecules increased the internalization efficiency with different degrees depending on the cell line. The conjugates showed antiproliferative activity due to their metabolic activation by nuclease degradation generating floxuridine monophosphate. The cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays showed an increase in the anti-cancer activity of the conjugates related to the floxuridine oligomer, but this effect did not correlate with the internalization results. Palmitic and folic acid conjugates provide the highest antiproliferative activity without having the highest internalization results. On the contrary, cholesterol oligomers that were the best-internalized oligomers had poor antiproliferative activity, even worse than the unmodified floxuridine oligomer. Especially relevant is the effect induced by palmitic and folic acid derivatives generating the most active drugs. These results are of special interest for delivering other therapeutic oligonucleotides.",nocancer
"This paper provides an analytical framework for explaining the practice of diagnostic disclosure by drawing on theoretical developments regarding the question of ""culture in action."" Based on ethnographic and interview data collected from fieldwork at a major cancer hospital in China from 2015 to 2019, this paper explains how doctors and family members make decisions about diagnostic disclosure. We argue that it is important to understand the practice of diagnostic disclosure as motivated by the actors' values on the one hand, and constrained and enabled by the actors' skills on the other hand. It is also necessary to distinguish between personal and public values, as well as medical and interpersonal skills. Based on these distinctions, we will be better equipped to explain why diagnostic disclosure has encountered difficulties in family-centered societies, such as China.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To compare a newly developed preoperative computed tomography physical status (CT-PS) score with the American Society of Anesthesiology performance status (ASA-PS) scale in the assessment of patient preoperative health status and stratification of perioperative risk before left colectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Preoperative chest-abdomen-pelvis CT examinations of patients who were scheduled to undergo elective laparoscopic left colonic resection for cancer in two centers were reviewed by two radiologists blinded to clinical data for the presence of several key imaging features in order to assess general, cardiac, pulmonary, abdominal, renal, vascular and musculoskeletal status. CT examinations of patients from center 1 were used to build a CT-PS score to predict ASA-PS>=III. CT-PS score was further validated using an external cohort of patients from center 2. RESULTS: During a 2-year period, 117 consecutive patients (63 men, 54 women; mean age, 65+-13 [SD] years; age range: 53-90 years) who underwent laparoscopic left colectomy for cancer in center 1 (66 patients, building cohort) and center 2 (51 patients, validation cohort) were retrospectively included. Ninety-one percent of patients were ASA-PS 1-2. Overall postoperative morbidity was 23% and severe morbidity 12%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of CT-PS score was 0.968 (95% CI: 0.901-1.000) in the building cohort and 0.828 (95% CI: 0.693-0.963) in the validation cohort. The optimal thresholds yielded 87% (95% CI: 83-91%) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI: 91-100%) specificity in the building cohort and 75% (95% CI: 69-81%) sensitivity and 83% (95% CI: 77-88%) specificity in the validation cohort for the prediction of ASA-PS. CONCLUSION: Preoperative chest-abdomen-pelvis CT thoroughly and wisely read is highly accurate to differentiate patients with ASA-PS I/II from those with ASA-PS III/IV before left colectomy.",nocancer

"BACKGROUND: Neutropenic enterocolitis (NE) is a potentially life-threatening disease that primarily occurs in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. NE has substantial morbidity and mortality, and its incidence has increased with the widespread use of chemotherapeutic agents such as taxanes, gemcitabine, and leucovorin in patients with lung, breast, gastric, and ovarian cancers. Sometimes NE can be a possible cause of death. Although, conservative approaches are often successful, there are currently no standardized treatment guidelines for NE and it is unclear when such strategies should be implemented. Therefore, we present this report to provide a greater insight into the possible treatment of NE. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 72-year-old woman with endometrial cancer who was undergoing treatment for hypertension, obesity and diabetes mellitus. The patient initially developed paralytic ileus on the 6th postoperative day (POD) after surgery for endometrial serous carcinoma. Complete recovery was achieved after 4 days of fasting and fluid replacement therapy. On the 27th POD, she received the first cycle of combination chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel and carboplatin. On day 5 of chemotherapy, she developed the systemic inflammatory response syndrome including febrile neutropenia and sepsis. She then developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and septic shock. The patient was subsequently moved to the intensive care unit (ICU). Despite initiating the standard treatment for septic shock and DIC, her overall status worsened. It was assumed that gut distention had led to bowel damage, subsequently leading to bacterial translocation. Thus, she developed NE with severe DIC and septic shock. We decided to reduce the intestinal pressure using an ileus tube to suction the additional air and fluid, even though doing so had a risk of worsening her general condition. The inflammatory reaction subsided, and her general condition improved. The patient recovered after 18 days in the ICU and was discharged alive. CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we describe a patient with suspected chemotherapy-associated NE. Our observations suggest that postoperative ileus may be one of the possible causes of NE. Patients who experience postoperative ileus must be carefully monitored while undergoing chemotherapy.",nocancer
"Agents that induce DNA damage can cure some cancers. However, the side effects of chemotherapy are severe because of the indiscriminate action of DNA-damaging agents on both healthy and cancerous cells. DNA repair pathway inhibition provides a less toxic and targeted alternative to chemotherapy. A compelling DNA repair target is the Fanconi anemia (FA) E3 ligase core complex due to its critical-and likely singular-role in the efficient removal of specific DNA lesions. FA pathway inactivation has been demonstrated to specifically kill some types of cancer cells without the addition of exogenous DNA damage, including cells that lack BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, or functionally related genes. In this perspective, we discuss the genetic and biochemical evidence in support of the FA core complex as a compelling drug target for cancer therapy. In particular, we discuss the genetic, biochemical, and structural data that could rapidly advance our capacity to identify and implement the use of FA core complex inhibitors in the clinic.",nocancer
"Hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) can occur in patients treated with immunosuppressive medications. Risk stratification for HBVr based on hepatitis B virus (HBV) serology and viral load is an important strategy to determine appropriate HBV monitoring and antiviral prophylaxis use. Recent advances in the understanding of pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases have led the development of cytokine-targeted therapies. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors have been widely used for patients with inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and rheumatic diseases. Further, the clinical benefits of interleukin (IL)-12/23, IL-17, or Janus kinases inhibitors have been demonstrated in these patients. It is well known that TNF-alpha inhibitor use can lead to HBVr, however, the risk of HBVr in patients undergoing non-TNF-targeted biologics have not been fully understood. In this review, we discuss the risk of HBVr in patients treated with non-TNF-targeted biologics, and immunological mechanisms of these medications causing HBVr.",nocancer
"Although photothermal therapy (PTT) has great potential for tumor inhibition, this single mode of action frequently encounters recurrence and metastasis, highlighting the urgent need for developing combination therapy. Inspired by established evidence that PTT could induce efficient immunogenic cell death (ICD), we here developed a versatile biomimetic nanoplatform (denoted as AuDRM) for the synergism of photothermal/starvation/immunotherapy against cancer. Specifically, dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully constructed followed by the in situ synthesis of Au NPs in the mesopores. Afterward, a hybrid membrane was coated to facilitate the loading of R837. Upon efficient accumulation in the tumor tissue by homotypic targeting, the pH-sensitive membrane could be jettisoned to ensure the exposure of Au NPs for starvation therapy and the effective release of the immunostimulator R837 for enhancement of immunotherapy. Except for the PTT-mediated tumor ablation, the induction of ICD coupled with the release of tumor antigens could work synergistically with the immunostimulator R837 for inhibiting the primary tumor as well as the metastasis and induce a long-term immune memory effect for tumor inhibition via a vaccine-like function. Thus, this study paves the way for high-performance tumor ablation by the synergism of photothermal/starvation/immunotherapy.",nocancer
"The in vivo antitumor effect of two NGR sequence containing peptide-daunomycin conjugates was studied on CD13+ Kaposi's sarcoma s.c. tumor model on SCID mice, and on orthotopically developed CD13- HT-29 colon adenocarcinoma SCID mouse model. Both tumor types were positive for integrins. Significant tumor growth inhibition was observed on both tumor types by the treatment with the conjugates (Dau=Aoa-GFLGK(cyclo[KNGRE]-GG)-NH2 (1) and Dau=Aoa-GFLGK(cyclo[NleNGRE]-GG)-NH2 (2)). KS conjugate 1 with rather stable construct was more potent in tumor growth inhibition that might be explained by the CD13 receptor recognition of NGR sequence. In contrast, conjugate 2 that has propensity to rearrange isoAsp derivative showed significantly higher inhibition on CD13- HT-29 tumor model that is related to the integrin binding of isoDGR sequence. Next to the low toxic side effect of the conjugates in comparison with the free daunomycin, the positive efficiency of the conjugates was detected by the lower proliferation index and lower neovascularization of the tumor tissue.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To benchmark and evaluate the clinical viability of novel analytical GPU-accelerated and CPU-based Monte Carlo (MC) dose-engines for spot-scanning intensity-modulated-proton-therapy (IMPT) towards the improvement of lung cancer treatment. METHODS: Nine patient cases were collected from the CNAO clinical experience and The Cancer Imaging Archive-4D-Lung-Database for in-silico study. All plans were optimized with 2 orthogonal beams in RayStation (RS) v.8. Forward calculations were performed with FRoG, an independent dose calculation system using a fast robust approach to the pencil beam algorithm (PBA), RS-MC (CPU for v.8) and general-purpose MC (gp-MC). Dosimetric benchmarks were acquired via irradiation of a lung-like phantom and ionization chambers for both a single-field-uniform-dose (SFUD) and IMPT plans. Dose-volume-histograms, dose-difference and gamma-analyses were conducted. RESULTS: With respect to reference gp-MC, the average dose to the GTV was 1.8% and 2.3% larger for FRoG and the RS-MC treatment planning system (TPS). FRoG and RS-MC showed a local gamma-passing rate of ~96% and ~93%. Phantom measurements confirmed FRoG's high accuracywith a deviation < 0.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Dose calculation performance using the GPU-accelerated analytical PBA, MC-TPS and gp-MC code were well within clinical tolerances. FRoG predictions were in good agreement with both the full gp-MC and experimental data for proton beams optimized for thoracic dose calculations. GPU-accelerated dose-engines like FRoG may alleviate current issues related to deficiencies in current commercial analytical proton beam models. The novel approach to the PBA implemented in FRoG is suitable for either clinical TPS or as an auxiliary dose-engine to support clinical activity for lung patients.",nocancer

In this study, using results of in vitro high-throughput specificity assays, and combining comparative models of pMHCs and TCRs using molecular docking, we have constructed all-atom models for the putative complexes of all their possible pairwise TCR-pMHC combinations. For the models obtained we have calculated a dataset of physics-based scores and have trained binary classifiers that perform better compared to their solely sequence-based counterparts. These structure-based classifiers pinpoint the most prominent energetic terms and structural features characterizing the type of protein-protein interactions that underlies the immune recognition of tumors by T cells.",nocancer

The impacts of some compounds on the viability of HT-29, MDA-MB-231, and MG-63 human cancer cell lines were examined under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions, and they showed certain inhibitory effects on cell viability. Moreover, it was found that the series of compounds had the ability to raise the pH of the tumor cell microenvironment. All the results proved that saccharide-modified thiadiazole sulfonamides have important research prospects for the development of CA IX inhibitors.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The promotion of early diagnosis is undoubtedly effective in reducing the burden of disease. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a diagnostic technology for liver cancer, but its implementation faces some challenges. Understanding the influencing factors of CEUS utilization is crucial for its successful implementation. However, such research is rare. The aims of this study were to investigate the status of CEUS utilization and its predictors in China. METHODS: Through multistage random sampling, a cross-sectional study design was conducted among physicians in charge of direct use of CEUS working at liver disease-related departments of sampled health institutions. To access the potential influencing factors of physicians' CEUS utilization, a structured questionnaire was developed based on the theoretical model, which was developed by integration of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Structural equation modeling was used to verify the proposed hypotheses, and analyze the relationship and mechanism between the factors. RESULTS: A total of 309 physicians were enrolled. The mean score of utilization behavior was 2.04 (SD = 1.07), and 37.22% above the mean. The favorable fitting results demonstrated that the integration of TAM and TPB was an acceptable model. SEM results also identified physicians' intentions to use CEUS was directly associated with utilization behavior (beta = 0.287, P < 0.001). Attitude (beta = 0.272, P < 0.001), subjective norm (beta = 0.172, P = 0.013), perceived behavioral control (beta = 0.491, P < 0.001) and perceived usefulness (beta = 0.108, P = 0.027) significantly influenced physicians' intentions. Besides, subjective norm (beta = 0.065, P = 0.021), perceived behavioral control (beta = 0.141, P = 0.003), and perceived ease of use (beta = 0.022, P = 0.033) indirectly affected physicians' CEUS utilization. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide a reference for understanding the factors associated with physicians' utilization of CEUS. Additionally, the proposed measures such as building innovative and incentive environment, providing high quality and adequate training, etc., will help promote the utilization of CEUS, thereby increasing the detection rate of liver cancer, and improving the survival rate and the quality of life for liver cancer patients.",nocancer
"To separate causal effects of histone acetylation on chromatin accessibility and transcriptional output, we used integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic analyses following acute inhibition of major cellular lysine acetyltransferases P300 and CBP in hematological malignancies. We found that catalytic P300/CBP inhibition dynamically perturbs steady-state acetylation kinetics and suppresses oncogenic transcriptional networks in the absence of changes to chromatin accessibility. CRISPR-Cas9 screening identified NCOR1 and HDAC3 transcriptional co-repressors as the principal antagonists of P300/CBP by counteracting acetylation turnover kinetics. Finally, deacetylation of H3K27 provides nucleation sites for reciprocal methylation switching, a feature that can be exploited therapeutically by concomitant KDM6A and P300/CBP inhibition. Overall, this study indicates that the steady-state histone acetylation-methylation equilibrium functions as a molecular rheostat governing cellular transcription that is amenable to therapeutic exploitation as an anti-cancer regimen.",nocancer
"Purpose: Etanercept (ETN), a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor, has been applied in the treatment of many diseases. However, whether it has effects on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its interaction with tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) remained unknown. Methods: Histopathological analysis of lung tissues from non-smokers and smokers with or without COPD was conducted using hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, Van Gieson (VG) staining, and terminal transferase-mediated biotin dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). TNF-alpha content was measured using Immunohistochemistry. Correlation analysis among apoptosis rate, smoke index, the FEV1/FVC ratio, and TNF-alpha-positive cells was performed. After ETN treatment and transfection of overexpressed or silenced TNFR1, levels of inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis and related genes expressions in cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-treated human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Hoechst 33342 staining, flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. Results: Pulmonary arterial remodeling and increased apoptotic and TNF-alpha+ HPAECs were found in lung tissue of smokers with or without COPD, with higher degrees in smokers with COPD. The numbers of apoptotic and TNF-alpha+ HPAECs were positively correlated with smoke index, while the FEV1/FVC ratio was negatively correlated with apoptotic HPAECs. In HPAECs, ETN downregulated the expressions of proteins related to CSE-induced apoptosis and the TNF receptor family, decreased CSE-induced cell apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine levels, and inhibited TNFR1 expression and p65 phosphorylation. Overexpressed TNFR1 reversed the effects of ETN on CSE-treated HPAECs, whereas silencing TNFR1 did the opposite. Conclusion: ETN protected HPAECs against CSE-induced inflammation and apoptosis via downregulating TNFR1, thus providing a potential therapy for smoking-induced COPD.",nocancer
"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion is highly associated with tumor invasion and metastasis; therefore, monitoring MMP secretion is important for disease progression study and therapy choosing. Though working well for intracellular MMP imaging, the performance of current MMP detection probes is impaired in secretion monitoring due to the diffusion of MMP in an extracellular environment after secretion and low secreted amount. Here, we design a cell membrane-anchored ratiometric upconversion nanoprobe (UCNPs-Cy3/Pep-QSY7/Ab) for in situ MMP secretion visualization. Anti-EGFR is functionalized on the nanoprobe to provide specific recognition to tumor cells and guarantee fast response to MMP2 in the local place of secretion. MMP-responsive cleavage of Pep-QSY7 results in Cy3 luminescence recovery at 580 nm, which is ratioed over an internal standard of UCNP emission at 654 nm for MMP2 detection. The presented cell membrane-anchored ratiometric upconversion nanoprobe demonstrated that satisfactory results for in situ monitoring of MMP2 secretion from MDA-MB-231 cells and MCF-7 cells, as well as in vivo imaging of metastatic lymph nodes, would provide a universal platform for protease secretion study and contribute to tumor invasiveness assessment.",nocancer
"Low ESL, Gow PJ, Testro A, Sinclair M. Low participation in preventative health measures in a cohort of liver transplant recipients: a cross-sectional analysis. Clin. Transplant. BACKGROUND: Despite high rates of infection and malignancy post-solid organ transplant, there are little data on patient participation in preventative healthcare. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of post-liver transplant patients to evaluate insight into transplant-associated infective and neoplastic risks, and receipt of vaccination and cancer surveillance in accordance with Australian and local institution-specific guidelines. Descriptive analyses were used to assess characteristics potentially influencing adherence. RESULTS: Of 219 patients surveyed, adherence to bowel cancer surveillance was significantly reduced in those distant from transplantation compared to those recently transplanted (95.8% if transplanted <=5 years ago vs. 68.3% if transplanted >5 years ago, p<0.001). Skin cancer surveillance participation with annual physician-directed examination was low (42.9%), particularly in younger patients (29.5% in <50yo vs. 48.1% in >=50yo, p=0.01), who were also less adherent to vaccination recommendations (72.1% in <50yo vs. 87.3% in >=50yo, p=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first analysis of preventative healthcare participation in a cohort of Australian liver transplant recipients, revealing concerning adherence to bowel and skin cancer surveillance recommendations. Major interventions to avoid preventable disease in this high-risk cohort are warranted.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Issues related to life and death are largely influenced by the culture and religious beliefs of a society. This research aimed to survey a sample of oncology nurses in Saudi Arabia about their attitude toward the do not resuscitate order (DNR). METHOD: A cross-sectional design was employed. A survey was sent to 190 nurses in the Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC) in King Fahad Medical City (KFMC). A total of 157 nurses with a diploma or higher degree agreed to participate in the study. RESULTS: Many nurses showed neutral attitude regarding DNR to cancer patients and/or their families 2.4+-.4. Moreover, the results of the multiple logistic regression tests revealed that all the listed factors are not associated with the attitude toward DNR orders (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: It is generally believed that nurses the faith and background of nurses from Muslim countries has a profound influence on their attitude toward DNR. However, this was not the picture that was revealed by the results of this study. In this study, all the nurses made it clear that they wanted to know about the autonomy of patients in respect of DNR orders. IMPLICATION TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: It is necessary to develop programmes that address the DNR order and respect of patient autonomy and rights. Moreover, hospital policies that address the issues of DNR order are required for all end-of-life care.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: to identify the occurrence of oncology teaching in undergraduate nursing curricula. METHODS: descriptive study, which data was obtained from curriculum and from Pedagogical Course Projects available on the websites from Brazilian public institutions, between June and July 2020. RESULTS: 143 undergraduate nursing courses were identified. From them, 132 nursing courses (corresponding to 89 education institutions) had available the curriculum and/or Pedagogical Course Projects. Only 7 (5.3%) of them had oncology as a mandatory subject, 4 of them in the Midwest Region. Only 35 (26.5%) had elective subject in Oncology, most of them in the Northeast (45.7%). CONCLUSIONS: on third of nursing courses at public institutions has Oncology subject in the curriculum, which is few considering the high incidence and mortality from cancer in the country. The findings contribute for discussions, in curricular accommodation, on the relevance of oncology teaching in nursing curricula.",nocancer
"We report a bio-inorganic hybrid system, [Mo154]@VLPs, constructed from the virus-like particles (VLPs) of the HPV capsid protein L1 and a giant disc-shaped, molybdenum-containing polyoxometalate of [Mo154]. The hybrid was purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation and further validated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). An assembly with [Mo154] improved the tolerance of VLPs to pH, temperature, and storage time, thereby defining an opportunity to reduce the cost of HPV vaccines. Moreover, the ability of [Mo154] to kill cancer cells was improved by 6% after being encapsulated inside the VLPs, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced biocompatibility of [Mo154]. The irradiation of both [Mo154] and [Mo154]@VLPs with an infrared light of 808 nm further enhanced their ability to destroy cancer cells by 3- and 2-fold, respectively, confirming that [Mo154] is an effective anti-tumor photo-thermal agent. Therefore, the successful hybrid of L1-p and [Mo154] improves the stability of VLPs and simultaneously paves the way to enhance the anti-tumor ability of [Mo154] and further extends its application prospects as a future anti-tumor drug.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE(S): The objective of the present manuscript is to elucidate the role of matrix stiffness in the malignant transformation of oral submucous fibrosis. DESIGN: The role of matrix stiffness in several cancers including oral cancer was reviewed with a tailored search strategy using relevant keywords as per the Medline format. The role of molecular mediators, Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) was weighed in the context of OSF along two distinct pathways. RESULTS: Increased matrix stiffness activates the transcriptional coactivators, YAP and TAZ shuttling between the nucleus and cytoplasm. YAP and TAZ, serve as mechanical transducers in promoting cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The hypoxic microenvironment in the advanced stage of OSF promotes the migratory phenotype through mechanical memory. CONCLUSIONS: Reprogramming of a stiff matrix has the potential to restore the Hippo-YAP/TAZ tumor suppressor pathway and reverse fibrosis-associated tumor development.",nocancer
"Thioxanthones are bioisosteres of the naturally occurring xanthones. They have been described for multiple activities, including antitumor. As such, the synthesis of a library of thioxanthones was pursued, but unexpectedly, four tetracyclic thioxanthenes with a quinazoline-chromene scaffold were obtained. These compounds were studied for their human tumor cell growth inhibition activity, in the cell lines A375-C5, MCF-7 and NCI-H460. Photophysical studies were also performed. Two of the compounds displayed GI50 values below 10 microM for the three tested cell lines, and structure-activity relationship studies were established. Three compounds presented similar wavelengths of absorption and emission, characteristic of dyes with a push-pull character. The structures of two compounds were elucidated by X-ray crystallography. Two tetracyclic thioxanthenes emerged as hit compounds. One of the two compounds accumulated intracellularly as a bright fluorescent dye in the green channel, as analyzed by both fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, making it a promising theranostic cancer drug candidate.",nocancer
"Cisplatin is one of the most effective anti-cancer drugs, but its efficacy is limited by the development of resistance. Previous studies have shown that mitochondria play critical roles in cisplatin cytotoxicity, however, the exact mechanism of mitochondria involved in cisplatin sensitivity has not been clarified. In this study, cisplatin triggered mitochondrial oxidative stress and the decrease of mitochondria membrane potential in human cervical cancer cells. Then we screened a series of mitochondrial relevant inhibitors, including mitochondrial mPTP inhibitors DIDS and CsA, and mitochondrial respiratory complex inhibitors Rot and TTFA. Among these, only DIDS, as the inhibitor of mitochondrial outer membrane protein VDAC1, showed strong antagonism against cisplatin toxicity. DIDS mitigated cisplatin-induced MFN1-dependent mitochondrial fusion, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage. These findings demonstrated that VDAC1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in the increase sensitivity of cisplatin, which provides an attractive pharmacological therapy to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy.",nocancer
"The development of reagentless sensors that can detect molecular analytes in biological fluids could enable a broad range of applications in personalized health monitoring. However, only a limited set of molecular inputs can currently be detected using reagentless sensors. Here, we report a sensing mechanism that is compatible with the analysis of proteins that are important physiological markers of stress, allergy, cardiovascular health, inflammation and cancer. The sensing method is based on the motion of an inverted molecular pendulum that exhibits field-induced transport modulated by the presence of a bound analyte. We measure the sensor's electric field-mediated transport using the electron-transfer kinetics of an attached reporter molecule. Using time-resolved electrochemical measurements that enable unidirectional motion of our sensor, the presence of an analyte bound to our sensor complex can be tracked continuously in real time. We show that this sensing approach is compatible with making measurements in blood, saliva, urine, tears and sweat and that the sensors can collect data in situ in living animals.",nocancer
"As a rapid and non-destructive biological serum detection method, SERS technology was widely used in the screening and medical diagnosis of various diseases by combining the analysis of serum SERS spectrum and multivariate statistical algorithm. Because of the high complexity of serum components and the variability of SERS spectra, which often resulted in the phenomenon that the SERS spectrum of the same biological serum was significantly different due to the different test conditions. In this experiment, through the dilution treatment of the serum and the systematic test of the serum of all concentration gradients with lasers of wavelength of 785, 633 and 532 nm, the most suitable conditions for detecting the serum were investigated. The experimental results showed that only when the serum is diluted to low concentration (10 ppm), the SERS spectrum with high reproducibility and stability could be obtained, furthermore, the low concentration serum had weak tolerance to laser, and 532 nm laser was not suitable for serum detection. In this paper, a set of test scheme for obtaining highly stable serum SERS spectra was established by using high-performance gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) as the active substrate of SERS. Through comparative analysis of SERS spectrum of serum of normal people and cervical cancer, the reliability of the established low-concentration serum test program was verified, as well as its great potential advantages in disease screening and diagnosis.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on how to best achieve a low central venous pressure during hepatectomy for the purpose of reducing blood loss and red blood cell (RBC) transfusions. We analyzed the associations between intraoperative hypovolemic phlebotomy (IOHP), transfusions, and postoperative outcomes in cancer patients undergoing hepatectomy. METHODS: Using surgical and transfusion databases of patients who underwent hepatectomy for cancer at one institution (11 January 2011 to 22 June 2017), we retrospectively analyzed associations between IOHP and RBC transfusion on the day of surgery (primary outcome), and with total perioperative transfusions, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative complications (secondary outcomes). We fitted logistic regression models by inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for confounders and reported adjusted odds ratio (aOR). RESULTS: There were 522 instances of IOHP performed during 683 hepatectomies, with a mean (standard deviation) volume of 396 (119) mL. The IOHP patients had a 6.9% transfusion risk on the day of surgery compared with 12.4% in non-IOHP patients (aOR, 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.98; P = 0.04). Total perioperative RBC transfusion tended to be lower in IOHP patients compared with non-IOHP patients (14.9% vs 22.4%, respectively; aOR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.44 to 1.16; P = 0.18). In patients with a predicted risk of >= 47.5% perioperative RBC transfusion, 24.6% were transfused when IOHP was used compared with 56.5% without IOHP. The incidence of severe postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo scores >= 3) was similar in patients whether or not IOHP was performed (15% vs 16% respectively; aOR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.54; P = 0.71). CONCLUSIONS: The use of IOHP during hepatectomy was associated with less RBCs transfused on the same day of surgery. Trials comparing IOHP with other techniques to reduce blood loss and transfusion are needed in liver surgery.",nocancer

Furthermore, computational procedures were used to investigate the binding mode of this class of compounds, within the active site of hCA IX.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Castration resistant prostate cancer progression is associated with an acquired intratumoral androgen synthesis. Signaling pathways that can upregulate androgen production in prostate tumor microenvironment are not entirely known. In this study, we investigate the potential effect of a secreted signaling protein named semaphorin 3C (SEMA3C) on steroidogenic activities of prostatic stromal cells. METHODS: We treated human primary prostate stromal cells (PrSC) with 1uM recombinant SEMA3C protein and androgen precursor named dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 1.7uM. Also, to test SEMA3C's effect on the conversion of DHEA to androgens, we exposed PrSCs to the conditioned media derived from LNCaP cells that were transduced with a lentiviral vector harboring full length SEMA3C gene or empty vector (CM-LNSEMA3C or CM-LNVector ). Then, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on steroids isolated from PrSCs media. The messnger RNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes in PrSCs was quantified by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Recombinant SEMA3C had no effect on steroidogenic activities in PrSCs. However, key steroidogenic enzymes expression and androgen synthesis were upregulated in PrSCs treated with CM-LNSEMA3C , compared to those treated with CM-LNVector . These results suggest that steroidogenic activities in PrSCs were upregulated in response to a signaling factor in CM-LNSEMA3C , other than SEMA3C. We hypothesized that SEMA3C overexpression in LNCaP cells affected androgen synthesis in PrSCs through sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway activation in PrSCs. We verified this effect by blocking Shh signaling with smoothened antagonist. CONCLUSION: Based on known ability of Shh signaling pathway to activate steroidogenesis in stromal cells, we suggest that SEMA3C overexpression in LNCaP cells can upregulate Shh which in turn is able to stimulate steroidogenic activities in prostatic stromal cells.",nocancer
"Objective: To discuss the techniques and repairing methods of various degree of compound tissue defects in the auriculotemporal region. Methods: Retrospective analysis was conducted on three cases of different repairing methods for huge compound tissue defects in different degrees in the auriculotemporal region after the resection of the malignant tumor or sinus tract due to repeated infection in our hospital. Results: Following total removal of the tumors or sinus tract in all patients, we applied retroauricular lingual flap transfer repairing, latissimus dorsi flap free transfer repairing and vascular anastomosis, scalp tissue expansion in stage I, then repairing the lesion with expanded scalp and filling the huge mastoid cavity with abdominal fat in stage II, respectively, according to the characteristics of compound tissue defects in the auriculotemporal region. All free flaps survived well. Conclusions: The anatomy of the auricular-temporal area is complex and involves important vascular and neural structures of head and neck and lateral skull base. The huge composite tissue defect following auriculotemporal region surgery, which is composed of skin, muscle and bone tissue, needs to be repaired in one stage. Therefore, flexible repairing methods should be chosen based on different situations, for attaining the goal of completely removing tumor and lesions, and then, covering the operation cavity.",nocancer
"Genome sequencing has revealed that each Streptomyces contains a wide range of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) and has the capability to produce more novel natural products than what is expected. However, most gene clusters for secondary metabolite biosynthesis are cryptic under normal growth conditions. In Streptomyces tsukubaensis, combining overexpression of the putative SARPs (Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory proteins) and bioactivity-guided screening, the silent gene cluster (tsu) was successfully activated and a novel bioactive anthracycline tsukubarubicin was further isolated and identified. Biological activity assays demonstrated that tsukubarubicin possessed much better antitumor bioactivities against various human cancer cell lines (especially the breast cancer cell lines) than clinically used doxorubicin. Moreover, the previously unreported gene cluster (tsu) for biosynthesis of tsukubarubicin was first characterized and detailed annotations of this gene cluster were also conducted. Our strategy presented in this work is broadly applicable in other Streptomyces and will assist in enriching the natural products for potential drug leads.

"PURPOSE: Among patients receiving chemotherapy, symptom monitoring with electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs) is associated with improved clinical outcomes, satisfaction, and compliance with therapy. Standard approaches for ePRO implementation are not established, warranting evaluation in community cancer practices. We present implementation findings of ePRO symptom monitoring across a large multisite community oncology practice network. METHODS: Patients initiating a new systemic therapy at one of the 210 practice sites at Texas Oncology were invited to use the Navigating Cancer ePRO platform, with stepped-wedge implementation from July to December 2020. Participating patients received a weekly prompt by text message or e-mail to self-report common symptoms and well-being. Severe self-reported symptoms triggered a real-time notification to nursing triage to address the symptom. Enrollment and compliance were systematically tracked weekly with evaluation of barriers and facilitators to adoption and sustainability. RESULTS: Four thousand three hundred seventy-five patients planning systemic treatment were enrolled and participated. Seventy-three percent (1,841 of 2,522) of enrolled patients completed at least one ePRO assessment. Among these individuals, 64% (16,299 of 25,061) of available weekly ePRO assessments were completed. Over a 10-week period, compliance declined from 72% to 52%. Barriers currently being addressed include lack of a second reminder text or e-mail prompt, inconsistent discussion of reported ePROs by clinicians at visits, and COVID-related changes in workflow. Facilitators included ease of use and patient and staff engagement on the importance of PROs for symptom management. CONCLUSION: ePROs can be effectively implemented in community oncology practice. Utilization of ePROs is high but diminishes over time without attention to barriers. Ongoing work to address barriers and optimize compliance are underway.",nocancer

"AIM: To build and preliminarily validate a Spanish-language instrument to assess the impact that CNCP has on the daily lives of people who suffer from it. BACKGROUND: The experience of pain is multifactorial and a correct assessment of it helps to control the intensity of pain. Although there are instruments that evaluate areas on which Chronic Non-Cancer Pain impacts, it would be necessary to include other aspects that scientific literature identifies as relevant. DESIGN: Instrument and construct cross-sectional study for psychometric validation. METHODS: A total of 157 items based on items from validated questionnaires were evaluated by a group of 21 chronic pain experts using Delphi methodology in three evaluation rounds. A final questionnaire of 55 items with a 5-point Likert-type scale was formed. This questionnaire was piloted on a total of 30 patients to assess their understanding of the items and the psychometric validation process was carried out (January to March 2020) on a subsequent sample of 395 people, all of whom attended Pain Units and Primary Care Centres of the Public Health System in Spain. RESULTS: The PAIN_Integral Scale  showed acceptable internal consistency scores measured by Cronbach's alpha. Exploratory Factor Analysis indicated a structure of nine factors that explain 71.02% of the total variance, from 157 to a final total of 36 items. Confirmatory Factor Analysis showing adequate values confirmed this structure. The effect size was used to calculate the cut-off points for the overall scale, setting them at scores of 130 and 135. CONCLUSION: This instrument would allow to assess other constructs and dimensions not included in the instruments previously available such as treatment compliance, proactivity, resilience, hopelessness due to pain and pain catastrophizing. However, despite the fact that the preliminary analysis shows good results, it is necessary to continue with its validation process in subsequent studies. IMPACT: The PAIN_Integral Scale  , once the validation process is finished, could be a complete enough instrument to allow a comprehensive healthcare assessment of Chronic Non-Cancer Pain's impact on daily nursing clinical practice and other healthcare professionals.",nocancer
"Radiotherapy (RT) is a popular clinical therapy method for extending cancer patient survival, but is hampered by severe side effects and the weak therapy effect. Herein, responsive degradable selenium (Se) theranostic agents (Se@SiO2 @Bi nanocomposites (NCs)) are fabricated, which combine computed tomography (CT) imaging and simultaneously enhance the therapeutic effects of photothermal therapy (PTT) and RT, while reducing the side effects of radiation. The Se@SiO2 @Bi theranostic agents can accumulate at the tumor site, and responsively decompose to releease Se, avoiding systemic toxicity by the element. Se enhances the effect of PTT/RT, simultaneously reducing the side effects of RT. The Se@SiO2 @Bi NCs as CT agents also exhibit significantly enhanced contrast imaging performance due to the high atomic number of Bi. More importantly, the Se@SiO2 @Bi NCs can be rapidly excreted without long-term toxicity, owing to responsive degradation into ultrasmall particles (<5 nm) at the tumor site. In vitro and in vivo results show that the Se@SiO2 @Bi NCs can remarkably inhibit tumor cells, without causing appreciable toxicity during the treatment. This study opens a new perspective in rationally designing responsive degradable theranostic agents for future tumor therapy with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and lesser side effects.",nocancer
"UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 1) regulates DNA methylation and histone modifications, and plays a key role in cell proliferation and the DNA damage response. However, the function of UHRF2, a paralog of UHRF1, in the DNA damage response remains largely unknown. Here, we show that UHRF2 is essential for maintaining cell viability after UV irradiation, as well as for the proliferation of cancer cells. UHRF2 was found to physically interact with ATR in a DNA damage-dependent manner through UHRF2's TTD domain. In addition, phosphorylation of threonine at position 1989, which is required for UV-induced activation of ATR, was impaired in cells depleted of UHRF2, suggesting that UHRF2 is essential in ATR activation. In conclusion, these results suggest a new regulatory mechanism of ATR activation mediated by UHRF2.",nocancer
"p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) regulates both the DNA damage response and p53 signaling. Although 53BP1's function is well established in DNA double-strand break repair, how its role in p53 signaling is modulated remains poorly understood. Here, we identify the scaffolding protein AHNAK as a G1 phase-enriched interactor of 53BP1. We demonstrate that AHNAK binds to the 53BP1 oligomerization domain and controls its multimerization potential. Loss of AHNAK results in hyper-accumulation of 53BP1 on chromatin and enhanced phase separation, culminating in an elevated p53 response, compromising cell survival in cancer cells but leading to senescence in non-transformed cells. Cancer transcriptome analyses indicate that AHNAK-53BP1 cooperation contributes to the suppression of p53 target gene networks in tumors and that loss of AHNAK sensitizes cells to combinatorial cancer treatments. These findings highlight AHNAK as a rheostat of 53BP1 function, which surveys cell proliferation by preventing an excessive p53 response.",nocancer

"Arctigenin(ARG) , a natural lignans compound isolated from Arctium lappa L. In this study, the anti-tumor effect of ARG on prostate cancer cell PC-3M and the mechanism of apoptosis and autophagy induced by PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway were discussed, and further confirmed by the joint treatment of ARG and PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Here, the effect of ARG on cell viability was evaluated in PC-3M cells by CCK-8 assay. After the treatment of ARG, colony formation assay was used to detect the anti-proliferation effect. Annexin V-FITC/PI kit and DAPI staining were used to detect the apoptosis level, and cell cycle changes were analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of autophagy was detected by acridine orange staining. In addition, the expression levels of apoptosis and autophagy-related proteins were analyzed by western blot. The result showed that different concentrations of ARG inhibited the proliferation of PC-3M cells. DAPI staining and flow cytometry showed that ARG induced PC-3M cell apoptosis and arrested cell in G0/G1 phase. Acridine orange staining showed that ARG induced autophagy in PC-3M cells. Western blot experiments showed that ARG inhibited the expression of Bcl-2 , promoted the expression of Bax and cleaved caspase-3. At the same time, the expression of autophagy-related proteins LC3B-II and Beclin-1 increased after ARG treatment, but P62 decreased. In addition, further studies have shown that treatment with LY294002 enhanced the effects of ARG on the expression of proteins associated with apoptosis and autophagy , indicating that ARG may induce apoptosis and autophagy through PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.",nocancer
"Human tissue kallikreins (KLKs) are serine proteases involved in various physiological and pathological conditions, including cancer and neurological disorders. These enzymes constitute attractive drug targets, which has stimulated the search for new KLK inhibitors. In this study, we have covalently immobilized porcine pancreas KLK on an NHS-activated Sepharose matrix, to obtain KLK-Sepharose-NHS. The immobilized enzyme showed high recovered activity and maintained the ability of free KLK to recognize the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC (KMapp = 10.3 +- 0.9 muM). As proof of concept, we used leupeptin as a reference inhibitor to perform inhibition studies for KLK-Sepharose-NHS and to determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 0.13 +- 0.01 muM), the inhibition constant (Ki = 0.06 muM), and the leupeptin inhibition mechanism. We evaluated several complex matrixes (plant crude extract) by the same bioassay, to demonstrate their applicability. The species Solanum lycocarpum, Stryphnodendron adstringens, and Psychotria carthagenensis gave the best results. KLK-Sepharose-NHS was fully active after six consecutive reaction cycles and retained about 60 % of its initial activity after being used for at least five months, so the bioassay developed herein is a promising strategy to screen and to identify KLK ligands.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Over the past decades, health care services for pancreatic surgery were reorganized. Volume norms were applied with the result that only a limited number of expert centers perform pancreatic surgery. As a result of this centralization of pancreatic surgery, the patient journey of patients with pancreatic tumors has become multi-institutional. To illustrate, patients are referred to a center of expertise for pancreatic surgery whereas other parts of pancreatic care, such as chemotherapy, take place in local hospitals. This fragmentation of health care services could affect continuity of care (COC). The aim of this study was to assess COC perceived by patients in a pancreatic care network and investigate correlations with patient-and care-related characteristics. METHODS: This is a pilot study in which patients with (pre) malignant pancreatic tumors discussed in a multidisciplinary tumor board in a Dutch tertiary hospital were asked to participate. Patients were asked to fill out the Nijmegen Continuity of Care-questionnaire (NCQ) (5-point Likert scale). Additionally, their patient-and care-related data were retrieved from medical records. Correlations of NCQ score and patient-and care-related characteristics were calculated with Spearman's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: In total, 44 patients were included (92% response rate). Pancreatic cancer was the predominant diagnosis (32%). Forty percent received a repetition of diagnostic investigations in the tertiary hospital. Mean scores for personal continuity were 3.55 +- 0.74 for GP, 3.29 +- 0.91 for the specialist and 3.43 +- 0.65 for collaboration between GPs and specialists. Overall COC was scored with a mean 3.38 +- 0.72. No significant correlations were observed between NCQ score and certain patient-or care-related characteristics. CONCLUSION: Continuity of care perceived by patients with pancreatic tumors was scored as moderate. This outcome supports the need to improve continuity of care within multi-institutional pancreatic care networks.",nocancer
"Levels of toxic elements in ambient PM2.5 were measured from 29 October 2019 to 30 March 2020 in Linfen, China, to assess the health risks they posed and to identify critical risk sources during different periods of the COVID-19 lockdown and haze episodes using positive matrix factorization (PMF) and a health-risk assessment model. The mean PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 145 mug/m3, and the 10 investigated toxic elements accounted for 0.31% of the PM2.5 mass. The total non-cancer risk (HI) and total cancer risk (TCR) of the selected toxic elements exceed the US EPA limits for children and adults. The HI for children was 2.3 times that for adults for all periods, which is likely due to the high inhalation rate per unit body weight for children. While the TCR for adults was 1.7 times that of children, which is mainly attributed to potential longer exposure duration for adults. The HI and TCR of the toxic elements during full lockdown were reduced by 66% and 58%, respectively, compared to their pre-lockdown levels. The HI and TCR were primarily attributable to Mn and As, respectively. Health risks during haze episodes were significantly higher than the average levels during COVID-19 lockdowns, though the HI and TCR of the selected toxic elements during full-lockdown haze episodes were 68% and 17% lower, respectively, than were the levels during pre-lockdown haze episodes. During the study period, fugitive dust and steel-related smelting were the highest contributors to HI and TCR, respectively, and decreased in these emission sources contributed the most to the lower health risks observed during the full lockdown. There, the control of these sources is critical to effectively reduce public health risks.",nocancer
"A reliable, specific, selective and robust liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the determination of ribociclib in both dried blood spot (DBS) samples and potassium EDTA plasma. DBS samples were obtained simultaneously with a plasma sample in advanced breast cancer patients treated with ribociclib. A 6 mm disk from the central part of the dried blood spot sample was punched, followed by extraction of ribociclib using liquid-liquid extraction spiked with ribociclib-d6 as internal standard. Concentrations of ribociclib in DBS samples were correlated with corresponding plasma concentrations. From the blood sample also hematocrit was determined. The method was validated for selectivity, sensitivity, precision, lower limit of detection, linearity, stability and accuracy according to the food and drug administration (FDA) guideline. The within- and between-run precisions were <=10.6 and <=1.07 %, respectively; while the average accuracy ranged from 100 to 103 %. The influence of hematocrit on validation parameters was tested in the range of 0.20 - 0.40 L/L. No influence of hematocrit on validation parameters was observed. Regression analysis and a Bland-Altman plot indicated correlation between the results obtained from DBS and plasma samples. A strong correlation (R2 >0.97) between DBS samples and plasma concentration from 17 breast cancer patients was found. A number of 12 out of 17 processed DBS samples (71 %) fell inside the acceptable range of 20 % difference of simultaneously obtained plasma samples. The lower limit of quantification in DBS is 10.0 ng/mL and linearity was demonstrated up to 1000 ng/mL. In conclusion, the newly developed assay met the required standard for validation. The methods were used to study ribociclib disposition in patients with advanced breast cancer.",nocancer
"A total of 106 marine microbial metabolites were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against human lung cancer cells. Results showed that 23 compounds exhibited activity in inhibiting the proliferation of A549 and H157 cells with IC50 values ranging from 1.5 to 48.2 muM. Pyrrospirone F, chrysophanol, physcion, and purpuride G are the four most active compounds with IC50 values of 1.5 - 7.3 muM. Further investigation of purpuride G (a newly discovered sesquiterpene lactone) demonstrated its potent antiproliferative activity against six different lung cancer cells of A549, H157, H460, H1299, H1703, and PC9 with IC50 values of 2.1 - 3.3 muM. The antiproliferative activity of purpuride G against cancer cells is related to block cell cycle, induce apoptosis through regulating the apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bax, and inhibit glycolysis by downregulating two key glycolytic enzymes of hexokinase 2 and pyruvate kinase M2.",nocancer
"Vitamin A is a group of vital micronutrients widely present in the human diet. Animal-based products are a rich source of the retinyl ester form of the vitamin, while vegetables and fruits contain carotenoids, most of which are provitamin A. Vitamin A plays a key role in the correct functioning of multiple physiological functions. The human organism can metabolize natural forms of vitamin A and provitamin A into biologically active forms (retinol, retinal, retinoic acid), which interact with multiple molecular targets, including nuclear receptors, opsin in the retina and, according to the latest research, also some enzymes. In this review, we aim to provide a complex view on the present knowledge about vitamin A ranging from its sources through its physiological functions to consequences of its deficiency and metabolic fate up to possible pharmacological administration and potential toxicity. Current analytical methods used for its detection in real samples are included as well.",nocancer
"Targeted sequencing enables sensitive and cost-effective analysis by focusing resources on molecules of interest. Existing methods, however, are limited in enrichment power and target capture length. Here, we present a novel method that uses compound nucleic acid cytometry to achieve million-fold enrichments of molecules >10 kbp in length using minimal prior target information. We demonstrate the approach by sequencing HIV proviruses in infected individuals. Our method is useful for rare target sequencing in research and clinical applications, including for identifying cancer-associated mutations or sequencing viruses infecting cells.",nocancer
"The shallow penetration depth of photothermal agents in the first near-infrared (NIR-I) window significantly limits their therapeutic efficiency. Multifunctional nanotheranostic agents in the second near-infrared (NIR-II) window have drawn extensive attention for their combined treatment of tumors. Here, for the first time, we created oxygen-deficient black SnO2-x with strong NIR (700-1200 nm) light absorption with NaBH4 reduction from white SnO2. Hyaluronic acid (HA) could selectively target cancer cells overexpressed CD44 protein. After modification with HA, the obtained nanotheranostic SnO2-x@SiO2-HA showed high dispersity in aqueous solution and good biocompatibility. SnO2-x@SiO2-HA was confirmed to simultaneously generate enough hyperthermia and reactive oxygen species with single NIR-II (1064 nm) light irradiation. Because HA is highly affined to CD44 protein, SnO2-x@SiO2-HA has specific uptake by overexpressed CD44 cells and can be accurately transferred to the tumor site. Furthermore, tumor growth was significantly inhibited following synergistic photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) with targeted specificity under the guidance of photoacoustic (PA) imaging using 1064 nm laser irradiation in vivo. Moreover, SnO2-x@SiO2-HA accelerated wound healing. This work prominently extends the therapeutic utilization of semiconductor nanomaterials by changing their nanostructures and demonstrates for the first time that SnO2-x based therapeutic agents can accelerate wound healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: : The phototherapeutic efficacy of nanotheranostics by NIR-I lightirradiation was restricted owing to the limitation of tissue penetration and maximum permissible exposure. To overcome these limitations, we hereby fabricated a NIR-IIlight-mediated multifunctional nanotheranostic based on SnO2-x. The introduction of oxygen vacancy strategy was employed to construct full spectrum responsive oxygen-deficient SnO2-x, endowing outstanding photothermal conversion, and remarkable production activity of reactive oxygen species under NIR-II light activation. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited following synergistic PDT/PTT with targeted specificity under the guidance of photoacoustic imaging using 1064 nm laser irradiation in vivo. Our strategy not only expands the biomedical application of SnO2, but also providea method to develop other inorganic metal oxide-based nanosystems for NIR-II light-activated phototheranostic of cancers.",nocancer
"The Lichen, Parmelia sulcata synthesizes various secondary metabolites, in which phenolic based compounds received much attention due to their importance in biomedical application. Especially the phenolic compound was effective against the cancer treatment. An effective administration of such plant natural product can represent a significant conventional management of cancer in terms of chemoprevention. The nanomedicines are group of agents that selectively interfere the cancer cells which leads to reduction of side effect thereby reducing the doses. Silver nanoparticles is a promising antitumor agent, however, the conventional production of silver nanoparticles have many drawbacks which led to increase in need of eco-friendly biological production methods. In this study, we made an attempt to synthesise a nano silver (Ps-AgNPs) from phenolic extract of lichen Parmelia sulcata extract. The Ps-AgNps was applied for anticancer activity using MCF-7 cells and the effect was characterised by western blotting method. The FTIR, XRD, UV and TEM results confirms the presence of silver nanoparticles in phenolic extract of lichen Parmelia sulcata. The cytotoxicity assay shows that the Ps-AgNPs is toxic against cancer cells (MCF-7) but not to normal cells (NIH3T3), which confirm the selective induction of cell death (apoptosis) against cancer cells. The Western blot analysis also clearly indicates the down regulation of inflammatory genes (TNF-alpha and IL-6) and cell cycle genes (PCNA and Cyclin-D1) thus promoting intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The results suggest that Ps-AgNPs can effectively kill cancer cells and can be used as an alternative therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Hepatic inflammatory pseudotumor (HIPT) is an uncommon benign tumor-like mass that mimics malignant tumors. CASE REPORT: A 73-year-old man was admitted with severe epigastric pain and high fever. He had received choledocojejunostomy. Enhanced computed tomography showed a 76 mm, heterogeneous, gradual enhanced low-density mass in the caudate lobe and hyperdense fluid was detected around the mass. Based on the diagnosis of hemorrhage from a hypervascular malignant liver tumor, chemoembolization was conducted. Antibiotics (Meropenem) were administered for 2 weeks, and methylprednisolone (125 mg) was administered twice as a premedication for chemoembolization. After the 2nd chemoembolization, rapid tumor shrinkage was observed and the inflammatory changes gradually disappeared. The tumor was finally diagnosed as fibrohistiocytic type HIPT with an ultrasound-guided percutaneous tumor biopsy. The diameter of the liver tumor decreased to 15 mm and intra-abdominal hemorrhage disappeared in 3 months. CONCLUSION: Development of HIPT can be associated with intra-abdominal hemorrhage.",nocancer
"In current practice, the use of circulating oncological biomarkers by clinicians is almost inseparable from cancer patients management. However, the interpretation of the results is not always easy because it is more specific to laboratory medicine and involves notions of peri-analytical orders as well as analytical sensitivity and specificity. In the past, the development of new analytical techniques improved the analytical sensitivity or allowed the implementation of new biomarkers; this observation would still be true today. Mass spectrometry, microRNA assay, or Single Molecule Array (SiMoA) are recent analytical developments with very good analytical performances that could contribute to the improvement of cancer patient management.",nocancer
"The bottom-up construction of enzyme-based artificial cells is generating increasing interest, but achieving artificial cells for ""all artificial modules"" remains challenging in synthetic biology. Here, we introduce a fully synthetic cell system by integration of biomimetic nanozymes into giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). To mimic native peroxidase for free radical generation by taking advantage of Fenton catalysis reactions, we designed and prepared a de novo artificial nanozyme composed of ferritin heavy-chain scaffold protein and catalytic Fe3O4 nanoparticles as the active center. As two examples in bioapplications, we showed this nanozyme-powered GUV system not only mimics intracellular oxidative stress pathways but also induces tumor cell death by sensing and responding to external chemical signals. Specifically, we recreated intracellular biochemical events, including DNA damage and lipid peroxidation, in the compartmentalized GUVs by taking advantage of nanozyme induction of defined catalytic reactions. Additionally, the GUV system also actively induced DNA double-strand breakage and lipid damage of tumor cells, in response to the high expression of H2O2 within the tumor microenvironment. This concept-of-proof study offers a promising option for defining catalysis in biological systems and gives new insights into the de novo creation of artificial cells in a fully synthetic manner.",nocancer
"Studies assessing the dose-response relationship for human skin cancer induction by solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) apply a range of methods to quantify relevant UVR doses, but information about the comparability of these datasets is scarce. We compared biologically weighted effectivities applying the most relevant UVR action spectra in order to test the ability of certain UVR detectors to mimic these biological effects at different times during the day and year. Our calculations were based on solar spectra measured at Dortmund, Germany (51.5  N) and at Townsville, Australia (19.3  S), or computed for latitudes 20  S and 50  N. Convolutions with the CIE action spectra for erythema and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) and with ICNIRP's weighting function showed comparable solar zenith angle (SZA) dependences with little influence of season or latitude. A different SZA dependence was found with Setlow's action spectrum for melanoma induction. Calculations for a number of UVR detector responsivities gave widely discrepant absolute irradiances and doses, which were nevertheless related to those calculated with both CIE spectra by correction factors largely independent of the SZA. Commonly used detectors can thus provide quite accurate estimates of NMSC induction by solar UVR, whereas they may be inadequate to mimic melanoma induction.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Exosomes as the main therapeutic vectors of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treatment and its mechanism remain unexplored. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6) is a glycoprotein secreted by MSC with the capacities of tissue repair and immune regulation. This study aimed to explore whether TSG-6 is a potential molecular target of exosomes derived from MSCs (MSCs-Exo) exerting its therapeutic effect against colon inflammation and repairing mucosal tissue. METHODS: Two separate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced IBD mouse models were intraperitoneally administered MSCs-Exo extracted from human umbilical cord MSC (hUC-MSC) culture supernatant. Effects of MSCs-Exo on intestinal inflammation, colon barrier function, and proportion of T cells were investigated. We explored the effects of MSCs-Exo on the intestinal barrier and immune response with TSG-6 knockdown. Moreover, recombinant human TSG-6 (rhTSG-6) was administered exogenously and colon inflammation severity in mice was evaluated. RESULTS: Intraperitoneal injection of MSCs-Exo significantly ameliorated IBD symptoms and reduced mortality rate. The protective effect of MSCs-Exo on intestinal barrier was demonstrated evidenced by the loss of goblet cells and intestinal mucosa permeability, thereby improving the destruction of tight junctions (TJ) structures and microvilli, as well as increasing the expression of TJ proteins. Microarray analysis revealed that MSCs-Exo administration downregulated the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and upregulated the anti-inflammatory cytokine in colon tissue. MSCs-Exo also modulated the response of Th2 and Th17 cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN). Reversely, knockdown of TSG-6 abrogated the therapeutic effect of MSCs-Exo on mucosal barrier maintenance and immune regulation, whereas rhTSG-6 administration showed similar efficacy to that of MSCs-Exo. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that MSCs-Exo protected against IBD through restoring mucosal barrier repair and intestinal immune homeostasis via TSG-6 in mice.",nocancer
"G-quadruplexes (G4s) are non-canonical structures formed by guanine-rich sequences of DNA or RNA that have attracted increased attention as anticancer agents. This systematic study aimed to investigate the anticancer potential of five G4-forming, sequence-related DNA molecules in terms of their thermodynamic and structural properties, biostability and cellular uptake. The antiproliferative studies revealed that less thermodynamically stable G4s with three G-tetrads in the core and longer loops are more predisposed to effectively inhibit cancer cell growth. By contrast, highly structured G4s with an extended core containing four G-tetrads and longer loops are characterized by more efficient cellular uptake and improved biostability. Various analyses have indicated that the G4 structural elements are intrinsic to the biological activity of these molecules. Importantly, the structural requirements are different for efficient cancer cell line inhibition and favorable G4 cellular uptake. Thus, the ultimate antiproliferative potential of G4s is a net result of the specific balance among the structural features that are favorable for efficient uptake and those that increase the inhibitory activity of the studied molecules. Understanding the G4 structural features and their role in the biological activity of G-rich molecules might facilitate the development of novel, more potent G4-based therapeutics with unprecedented anticancer properties.",nocancer
"Microrchidia family CW-type zinc finger 2 (MORC2) is a recently identified chromatin modifier with an emerging role in cancer metastasis. However, its role in glucose metabolism, a hallmark of malignancy, remains to be explored. We found that MORC2 is a glucose-inducible gene and a target of c-Myc. Our meta-analysis revealed that MORC2 expression is positively correlated with the expression of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, overexpression of MORC2 in MCF-7 and BT-549 cells augmented the expression and activity of a key glucose metabolism enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Conversely, selective knock down of MORC2 by siRNA markedly decreased LDHA expression and activity and in turn reduced cancer cell migration. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that MORC2, a glucose-inducible gene, modulates the migration of breast cancer cells through the MORC2-c-Myc-LDHA axis.",nocancer
"Delphinidin is an anthocyanin that belongs to the group of flavonoids that exert numerous biological activities. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of delphinidin remain poorly understood. In our study we analyzed delphinidin modulate STAT-3 and MAPKinase signaling thereby inhbits cell proliferation and promote apoptosis. Our study demonstrated that delphinidin treatment significantly reduced the viability of human colon cancer HCT116 in a concentration-dependent manner. We noticed that delphinidin effectively induced oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis by generating intracellular ROS, decreasing antioxidant levels, inducing lipid peroxidation, and single-strand break on colon cancer cells. In this study, we observed that delphinidin treatment alters the mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby induces apoptosis was closely associated with the induction of pro-apoptotic Bax, Caspase- 3,8 & 9, cytochrome C, and inhibition of anti-apoptotic protein expression. Studies on STAT-3 and MAPKinase signaling showed delphinidin inhibited the phosphorylation of these transcription factors' activity. Inhibition of STAT-3, p38, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and modulation pro-apoptotic protein expression might be responsible for the anticancer activity of delphinidin in colon cancer cells.",nocancer
"CONTEXT: Prior research suggests the potential for political campaign advertisements to increase psychological distress among viewers. The current study tests relationships between estimated exposure to campaign advertising and the odds of respondents reporting that a doctor told them they have anxiety, depression, insomnia, or (as a negative control) cancer. METHODS: A secondary analysis of U.S. data on televised campaign ad airings from January 2015 to November 2016 (n = 4,659,038 airings) and five waves of a mail survey on television viewing patterns and self-reported medical conditions from November 2015 to March 2017 (n = 28,199 respondents from n = 16,204 unique households in the U.S.). FINDINGS: A 1 percent increase in the estimated volume of campaign advertising exposure was associated with a 0.06 [95% CI 0.03-0.09] percentage point increase in the odds of a respondent being told by a doctor that they have anxiety in the past 12 months. We observed this association regardless of the political party of the ad sponsor, the political party of the respondent, or their statistical interaction. We also observed this association for both Presidential campaign ads and non-Presidential (including local, state, and U.S. congressional election) campaign ads, providing evidence that these relationships were not driven by the unique divisiveness of the race between Donald Trump and Hilary Clinton. Some topic-specific models offered additional evidence of association between estimated volume of campaign advertising exposure and the odds of being told by a doctor that they have depression or insomnia, but these patterns were less consistent across models that utilized different categories of campaign exposure. Campaign ad exposure was not associated with cancer, which served as a negative control comparison. CONCLUSIONS: There was a consistent positive association between the volume of campaign advertising exposure and a reported diagnosis of anxiety among American adults.",nocancer
"Acute cholangitis (AC) is potentially fatal. Microbiological identification and susceptibility to antibiotics in every Hospital is essential to direct treatment. (1) In our hospital, a third-level cancer hospital, a retrospective, analytical study of 30 patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiography with AC and positive biliary culture (BC) was performed over a period of 6 months. We found that 90% of BC were monomicrobial, with E. coli in more than half of these patients (55%). It is worth mentioning that 27% of the strains were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL). In the susceptibility analysis we found that 78% were sensitive to carbapenems, 66% to aminoglycids and 44% to piperacillin-tazobactam. Pseudomoas aeruginosa was found in 15% of the BC, but only 40% were sensitive to carbapenems. Despite the similarities of this cohort with other studies (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) it is worth mentioning that we found a high proportion of E.coli-ESBL and P.aeruginosa. Is important to mention that these patients had history of hospitalization (3 months), previous use of antibiotics, previous instrumentation of the bile duct, albumin <3.5g/dl and moderate AC (1). With the findings of this cohort, we considered that being a specialized hospital with oncologic patients with previous hospitalizations and previous medical and endoscopic interventions may contribute to find aggressive bacteria in the cultures so initial antimicrobial treatment should consider broad spectrum antibiotics with coverage for these microorganisms.",nocancer

"DNAzyme-based genetherapy holds immense prospects for effectively treating severe diseases, yet is constrained with inefficient delivery and unconditional activation. Herein, we designed a bioinspired self-catabolic DNA nanocapsule for sustaining tumor-specific cascade activation of therapeutic DNAzyme. The exquisite DNAzyme was temporarily masked by the self-excising DNAzyme in the hierarchical rolling circle replication (RCR) nanostructures, thus stayed in an inactive state in physiological fluids. Through the multivalent tumor-anchoring aptamer strands, the RCR nanocapsule was specifically accumulated in cancer cells and was sequentially activated for motivating the ultimate DNAzyme-mediated gene silencing via the intelligent stimuli-responsive cascade DNAzyme activation.

"Cancer is a very distressing disease, not only for the patients themselves, but also for their family members and relatives. Therefore, patients are regularly monitored to decide whether psychological treatment is necessary and applicable. However, such monitoring processes are costly in terms of required staff and time. Mobile data collection is an emerging trend in various domains. The medical and psychological field benefits from such an approach, which enables experts to quickly collect a large amount of individual health data. Mobile data collection applications enable a more holistic view of patients and assist psychologists in taking proper actions. We developed a mobile application, FeelBack, which is designed to support data collection that is based on well-known and approved psychological instruments. A controlled pilot evaluation with 60 participants provides insights into the feasibility of the developed platform and it shows the initial results. 31 of these participants received paper-based questionnaire and 29 followed the digital approach. The results reveal an increase of the overall acceptance by 58.5% in the mean when using a digital screening as compared to the paper-based. We believe that such a platform may significantly improve cancer patients' and relatives' psychological treatment, as available data can be used to optimize treatment.",nocancer
"Caesalpinia bonduc and C. decapeleta var. japonica have great importance in traditional medicine systems but scientific information's are still lacking for their potentials. To explore their bioactivity, we assessed the antioxidant, enzyme inhibitory abilities of the dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate, methanol, and water extracts prepared from the leaves and bark. The cytotoxicity and anticancer properties of the extracts were also assessed in vitro. The water extract of C. decapeleta leaves possessed highest phenolic content (108.16 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g extract), while the highest flavonoid content was recorded for the C. bonduc leaf methanolic extract (27.89 mg rutin equivalent (RE)/g extract). In general, C. decapeleta extracts possessed higher radical scavenging potential compared to C. bonduc extracts. C. decapeleta DCM leaves extract (10.20 mg galantamine equivalent (GALAE)/g extract) showed highest inhibition against butyrylcholinesterase. The cytotoxicity of the most potent methanolic and aqueous extracts were assessed against four cell lines. The chemical profiles of both species appeared to be different. C. bonduc was abundant in organic and phenolic acids as well as their esters. Flavonoid glycosides, bonducellin and its derivatives and caesalminaxins were identified. Whereas, C. decalpetala possessed many galloylated compounds. The cytotoxicity of C. bonduc and C. decapetala extracts was tested using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) based assay on VERO (kidney of an adult African Green monkey cells), HeLa (human cervical adenocarcinoma cells), RKO (human colon carcinoma cells), FaDu (human hypopharyngeal squamous carcinoma cells) cell lines. C. bonduc bark water extract exhibited the highest cytotoxicity towards HeLa (50 % cytotoxic concentration (CC50): 28.5 mug/mL) cancer cell line, as compared to normal VERO cells (CC50:35.87 mug/mL). For C. decapetala, the highest cytotoxicity was found for bark methanol extract on the HeLa cells with CC50 of 46.08 mug/mL and selectivity index of 3.33. In the gene ontology analysis, prostate cancer, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling, proteoglycans in cancer pathways might support the results of the cytotoxic assays. These results showed that the tested Caesalpinia species, showing potent inhibitory action against butyrylcholinesterase, might represent novel phytotherapeutic avenues for the management of Alzheimer's disease.",nocancer
"Heat stress due to global warming exerts deleterious effects on both humans and animals. However, nutritional strategies to reduce heat stress-induced intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In the present study, 240 tilapia were distributed into four treatment groups that were fed a basal diet supplemented with or without 0.1% Yucca schidigera extract under normal (28  C) temperature or heat stress (36  C) conditions for 2 weeks. Our results showed that tilapia exposed to heat stress resulted in growth arrest, intestinal dysfunction, oxidative damage, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and pro-inflammatory response, which were significantly relieved by yucca supplementation. The alleviative effect of Yucca schidigera extract was related to the down-regulation of mRNA expression of ubiquitin-proteasome system (Polyubiquitin, Proteasome 26S, Proteasome alpha5, Proteasome beta3, and Ubiquitin-like 3) and inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 8), as well as the improved histological structure and activation of Hsp70, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 signaling, interleukin 10, lysozyme, complement 3, and acid phosphatase in the intestine of tilapia. Collectively, these results indicated that heat stress-induced growth arrest, intestinal dysfunction, and oxidative damage were alleviated by dietary supplementation with Yucca schidigera extract. This offers a nutritional way of improving the growth and intestinal health of tilapia exposed to a hot environment.",nocancer
"CK2 is a protein kinase that plays important roles in many physio-pathological cellular processes. As such, the development of chemical probes for CK2 has received increasing attention in the past decade with more than 40 lead compounds developed. In this review, we aim to provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of the chemical probes acting outside the highly-conserved ATP-site developed to date. Such probes belong to different classes of molecules spanning from small molecules to peptides, act with a range of mechanisms of action and some of them present themselves as promising tools to investigate the biology of CK2 and therefore develop therapeutics for many disease areas including cancer and COVID-19.",nocancer
"Exposure to styrene is a major safety concern in the fibreglass processing industry. This compound is classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a possible human carcinogen. Several types of analytical equipment exist for detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the atmosphere; however, most of them operate ex-situ or do not provide easy discrimination between different molecules. This work introduces an improved and portable method based on FTIR spectroscopy to analyse toxic gaseous substances in working sites down to a concentration of less than 4 ppm. Styrene and a combination of VOCs typically associated with it in industrial processes, such as acetone, ethanol, xylene and isopropanol, have been used to calibrate and test the methodology. The results demonstrate that the technique offers the possibility to discriminate between different gaseous compounds in the atmosphere with a high degree of confidence and obtain very accurate quantitative information on their concentration, down to the ppm level, even when different VOCs are present in a mixture.",nocancer
"Branched-chain alpha-keto acids (BCKAs, namely, alpha-ketoisovaleric acid (KIV), alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (KIC), and alpha-keto-beta-methylvaleric acid (KMV)) are related to many diseases such as myeloid leukemia, liver cancer, and diabetes mellitus. A rapid quantitative analytical method for BCKAs using pillar array columns was developed. alpha-Keto acids were labeled with 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB), followed by their separation on octadecylsilane-treated pillar array columns with MeOH/H2O as the mobile phase. Five DMB-labelled alpha-keto acids including the internal standard were separated in 160 s. The lower limits of quantification for DMB-alpha-keto acids were 2-5 muM. The intra- and interday precisions were 2.9-6.6 % and 5.2-10.7 %, respectively. The developed method was applied to BCKA quantification in human plasma samples; KIV, KIC, and KMV concentrations were determined to be 13.8, 24.2, and 15.2 muM, respectively. The method realized rapid, sensitive, and precise analysis of BCKAs and can be applied for clinical diagnosis.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Reduction of the Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) degrading enzyme S1P lyase 1 (SGPL1) initiates colorectal cancer progression with parallel loss of colon function in mice. We aimed to investigate the effect of SGPL1 knockout on the stem cell niche in these mice. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical and multi-fluorescence imaging on tissue sections of wildtype and SGPL1 knockout colons under disease conditions. Furthermore, we generated SGPL1 knockout DLD-1 cells (SGPL1-/-M.Ex1) using CRISPR/Cas9 and characterized cell cycle and AKT signaling pathway via Western blot, immunofluorescence, and FACS analysis. RESULTS: SGPL1 knockout mice were absent of anti-Ki-67 staining in the stem cell niche under disease conditions. This was accompanied by an increase of the negative cell cycle regulator FOXO3 and attenuation of CDK2 activity. SGPL1-/-M.Ex1 cells show a similar FOXO3 increase but no arrest of proliferation, although we found a suppression of the PDK1/AKT signaling pathway, a prolonged G1-phase, and reduced stem cell markers. CONCLUSIONS: While already established colon cancer cells find escape mechanisms from cell cycle arrest, in vivo SGPL1 knockout in the colon stem cell niche during progression of colorectal cancer can contribute to cell cycle quiescence. Thus, we propose a new function of the S1P lyase 1 in stemness.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Octreotide acetate subcutaneous injection is indicated to treat acromegaly and the symptoms of carcinoid tumors and vasoactive intestinal peptide tumors (VIPomas). This formative human factors study assessed the octreotide acetate pen injector and accompanying instructions for use (IFU) with self-trained participants. METHODS: The study enrolled patients with diagnoses of acromegaly, carcinoid tumors, or VIPomas and healthcare practitioners (HCPs) who treat patients with these diagnoses. The IFU provided a stepwise process with illustrations to train participants on using the pen injector. Participants familiarized themselves with the pen injector and the IFU before administering 2 unaided injections into skin-like pads; administering the full dose into the pad was considered a successful injection. The investigators evaluated each injection by performance measures-specific tasks necessary to safely and correctly administer the medication-and subjective measures, which included participant comments, feedback from questions, and suggestions for improvements. RESULTS: The study enrolled 11 participants-8 patients and 3 HCPs. Participants had a success rate of 100% for both injections. Errors included 1 participant priming the pen with the incorrect dose and 2 participants not holding the injector button for 10 s after the injection. Neither error led to a failed injection. To improve the IFU, participants suggested changing the order of wording on the priming step, clarifying illustrations of the plunger, and stronger indications to hold the injector button. CONCLUSION: The octreotide pen injector and IFU were usable by self-trained participants. Participant errors and suggestions provided a foundation for recommendations to improve the IFU.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis commonly present with a dry cough; a productive cough suggests a complicating airway infection or an alternative diagnosis such as tuberculosis or bronchiectasis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 36-year-old European (Frisian) woman recently diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis presented with debilitating exertional dyspnea and cough productive of glazy mucoid sputum. Several different attempts including video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsies failed to reach a second or alternative diagnosis including an infectious, autoimmune or collagen-vascular condition. She responded to steroids but with poor tolerance to this treatment, which could not be tapered. After she was started on anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) therapy with infliximab, 200 mg at three-monthly intervals, she has been fine for well over a decade. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient with sarcoidosis who had a productive cough accompanied by fever, an extensive workup and prolonged follow-up, an alternative or second diagnosis could be ruled out; we therefore conclude that this highly unusual presentation is part of the clinical spectrum of sarcoidosis.",nocancer
"Bacterial and mammalian proteins, such as lysozyme, are gaining increasing interest as anticancer drugs. This study aims to modify the lysozyme structure using cold atmospheric plasma to boost its cancer cell killing effect. We investigated the structure at acidic and neutral pH using various experimental techniques (circular dichroism, fluorescence, and mass spectrometry) and molecular dynamics simulations. The controlled structural modification of lysozyme at neutral pH enhances its activity, while the activity was lost at acidic pH at the same treatment conditions. Indeed, a larger number of amino acids were oxidized at acidic pH after plasma treatment, which results in a greater distortion of the lysozyme structure, whereas only limited structural changes were observed in lysozyme after plasma treatment at neutral pH. We found that the plasma-treated lysozyme significantly induced apoptosis to the cancer cells. Our results reveal that plasma-treated lysozyme could have potential as a new cancer cell killing drug.",nocancer
"The use of pulses, such as chickpea, has become more relevant in baking as they exhibit potential health benefits such as reduction of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and prevention of colon cancer. It is also a good source of highly bioavailable protein at a low cost. This allows companies to develop new innovative products that meet the demand for nutritional value-added baked goods. Further understanding of the baking properties and rheology of chickpea flours will allow the baking industry to overcome processing and quality challenges related to the effects caused by the addition of non-gluten-forming ingredients. Therefore, the objective of this review was to summarize the rheological properties of baking formulations using chickpea as an ingredient in order to produce quality products while preserving the nutritional aspects of this legume. It also covers health benefits linked to chickpea-specific compounds.",nocancer
"A multifunctional nanoplatform (1), MnCO@TPP@C-TiO2, which consists of a carrier of carbon-doped TiO2 nanoparticles with surface covalent functionalization of manganese carbonyls and a directing group of triphenylphosphine, was prepared for mitochondria-targeted carbon monoxide (CO) delivery combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT). MnCO@TPP@C-TiO2 selectively localized in the mitochondria of HeLa cells where the overexpressed-H2O2 triggered CO release resulting in mitochondrial damage. And singlet oxygen species generated upon 808 nm near infrared light irradiation further destroyed the mitochondria and induced cancer cells apoptosis. Cytotoxicity assays revealed that the nanoplatform with mitochondria-targeted CO delivery and PDT exhibited the highest lethality against cancer cells in comparison with all the other control samples tested, and it showed good dark biocompatibility with normal cells that express low H2O2 levels. This work may provide new insights into combining CO-based gas therapy with traditional PDT for efficient cancer treatment.",nocancer
"Traditional combinational photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) were limited in clinical therapy of cancer due to exceptionally low drug payload and activation by light with separate wavelengths. We have accidentally discovered that zinc phthalocyanine (ZNPC, a typical hydrophobic photosensitizer) and indocyanine green (ICG, a clinically approved fluorescence probe) could be co-assembled into carrier-free nanodrugs (almost 100 wt%) for single NIR laser-induced efficient PDT/PTT. Interestingly, ICG could act as ""transformers"" for modulating the geometric shape of ZNPC/ICG co-assembling structures from needle-like/spindle-like structure via cubic structure finally to spherical structure. Unfortunately, the nanodrugs suffered from rapid immune clearance. The ZNPC-ICG nanoprobes were further embedded into the erythrocyte membrane (RBC)-camouflaged framework. The designed ZNPC-ICG@RBC could be efficiently accumulated within the tumor sites (continue for ~60 h) and rapidly internalized into cancer cells upon laser irradiation rather than macrophage RAW264.7 cells. Compared with the free ZnPC or ICG, the biomimetic ZNPC-ICG@RBC nanoprobes exhibited amplified therapeutic effects by simultaneously producing ROS and hyperthermia, thereby synergistically improving antitumor efficiency and eliminating the tumors without any regrowth under the guidance of fluorescence imaging. The co-delivery of ZnPC and ICG via a biomimetic carrier-free system might be a promising strategy for bimodal phototherapy of cancer.",nocancer
"Cancer is becoming a major threat to national public health security. The integration of disease diagnosis and monitoring with treatment has become a hot spot for researchers. The amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) nanoparticles prepared by the group in the previous stage could not precisely treat the lesion without tumor targeting and imaging characteristics. In this paper, water-soluble hyaluronic acid fluorescent carbon nanoparticles (HA-FCNs) were prepared and co-interacting with ACP nanoparticles to form hyaluronic acid fluorescent carbon/amorphous calcium phosphate (HA-FCNs/ACP) nanoparticles. The basic characteristics were characterized and the biological characteristics before and after drug loading were evaluated. HA-FCNs/ACP nanoparticles have good hemocompatibility, pH responsiveness, and enzymatic release. HA-FCNs and HA-FCNs/ACP nanoparticles are dispersed in the cytoplasm through the overexpressed CD44 receptors, which are actively targeted into A549 cells. Besides, the migration of A549 cells would be inhibited after cells were treated with drug-loaded nanomaterials. Therefore, the as-prepared nanoparticles can be used to monitor and treat focal sites through tumor-targeting bioimaging, pH-responsive, and enzymatic drug release properties, thus enabling integrated diagnosis and treatment.",nocancer
"Objective: To examine the safety and feasibility of using fusion indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (FIGFI) technique for intraoperative evaluation of colorectal perfusion in the totally laparoscopic left colectomy. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to collect the clinical data of 58 patients with left colon cancer who underwent totally laparoscopic surgery at the Colorectal Surgery Department, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences from October 2016 to December 2019. There were 39 males and 19 females, aging (57.0+-10.1)years(range:28 to 75 years). According to whether the FIGFI was used during the operation, they were divided into 36 cases in the study group and 22 cases in the control group. The clinical pathological characteristics, operative and postoperative recovery of the two groups were compared by t test, chi2 test, and Fisher exact test. Results: All the 58 patients underwent R0 resection with totally laparoscopic surgery. In the study group, due to poor bowel blood flow after cutting the mesentery (Sherwinter score = 1), 1 patient had to be expanded the resection range until the blood flow was rich(Sherwinter score>=3), and 1 patient in the control group had the complication of postoperative anastomotic leakage of grade A. Compared with the control group, the operation time in the study group was shorter ((156.3+-43.5) minutes vs. (180.4+-41.3) minutes, t=-2.083, P=0.042). However, there were no significant differences in the amount of blood loss, postoperative hospital stay, postoperative time of anal exhaust, length of bowel resection, number of lymph nodes dissected, and in the incidence of postoperative complications between the two groups. Median follow-up period was 23 months (range: 18 to 37 months). There were no long-term postoperative complications such as ischemic enteritis and anastomotic stenosis in both groups. Conclusions: The FIGFI is safe and feasible to assess the blood supply of intestinal segment and anastomosis during totally laparoscopic left hemicolectomy, and is easy to operate. It is expected to reduce the incidence of anastomotic leakage.",nocancer
"The sensing and generation of cellular forces are essential aspects of life. Traction force microscopy (TFM) has emerged as a standard broadly applicable methodology to measure cell contractility and its role in cell behavior. While TFM platforms have enabled diverse discoveries, their implementation remains limited in part due to various constraints, such as time-consuming substrate fabrication techniques, the need to detach cells to measure null force images, followed by complex imaging and analysis, and the unavailability of cells for postprocessing. Here we introduce a reference-free technique to measure cell contractile work in real time, with commonly available substrate fabrication methodologies, simple imaging, and analysis with the availability of the cells for postprocessing. In this technique, we confine the cells on fluorescent adhesive protein micropatterns of a known area on compliant silicone substrates and use the cell deformed pattern area to calculate cell contractile work. We validated this approach by comparing this pattern-based contractility screening (PaCS) with conventional bead-displacement TFM and show quantitative agreement between the methodologies. Using this platform, we measure the contractile work of highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells that is significantly higher than the contractile work of noninvasive MCF-7 cells. PaCS enables the broader implementation of contractile work measurements in diverse quantitative biology and biomedical applications.",nocancer
"Over the last years, technological innovation in Radiotherapy (RT) led to the introduction of Magnetic Resonance-guided RT (MRgRT) systems. Due to the higher soft tissue contrast compared to on-board CT-based systems, MRgRT is expected to significantly improve the treatment in many situations. MRgRT systems may extend the management of inter- and intra-fraction anatomical changes, offering the possibility of online adaptation of the dose distribution according to daily patient anatomy and to directly monitor tumor motion during treatment delivery by means of a continuous cine MR acquisition. Online adaptive treatments require a multidisciplinary and well-trained team, able to perform a series of operations in a safe, precise and fast manner while the patient is waiting on the treatment couch. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to rapidly contribute to MRgRT, primarily by safely and efficiently automatising the various manual operations characterizing online adaptive treatments. Furthermore, AI is finding relevant applications in MRgRT in the fields of image segmentation, synthetic CT reconstruction, automatic (on-line) planning and the development of predictive models based on daily MRI. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current AI integration in MRgRT from a medical physicist's perspective. Medical physicists are expected to be major actors in solving new tasks and in taking new responsibilities: their traditional role of guardians of the new technology implementation will change with increasing emphasis on the managing of AI tools, processes and advanced systems for imaging and data analysis, gradually replacing many repetitive manual tasks.",nocancer
"We, herein, presented a rare case of bilateral brachial artery infiltration by tumoral calcinosis located on both elbows. A 58-yearold man presented with a history of painless, palpable solid mass restricting the range of motion of both elbows. These masses were located on the anterior aspect of the elbows and gradually enlarged. After clinical, laboratory and radiological examinations, tumoral calcinosis was suspected, and excisional biopsy was planned for a definite diagnosis. Surgery was first performed on the left elbow. The median nerve was found to be compressed but not infiltrated by the mass. Interestingly, the brachial artery was totally infiltrated throughout the entire mass. Occlusion was observed in the brachial artery located within the mass. The tumor on the left elbow, 8.5 x 5.5 x 2.5 cm in size, was totally excised with approximately 12-cm brachial artery segment. The artery was resected until the healthy tissue was reached. The defect was reconstructed with saphenous vein graft obtained from the ipsilateral lower extremity. The same surgical procedure was performed on the right elbow after 3 months. The tumor size on the right elbow was 7 x 3.5 x 1.7 cm. Approximately 15-cm brachial artery segment was excised, and the defect was reconstructed with saphenous vein graft. Tumoral calcinosis is a rare benign condition that can be located in close relationship with neurovascular structures. In such cases, detailed neurologic and vascular examination, including imaging modalities, for arterial flow is essential to establish a more accurate surgical plan and avoid any unexpected situation during surgery.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) is a primary cause of hospitalization and death in COPD. Serum CA-125 and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) are related to AECOPD. We investigated correlations between serum markers and AECOPD. METHODS: In total, 132 patients with AECOPD were included from January 2017 to December 2019. Participants were followed for 1 year. Patients were assigned to the poor prognosis (n = 40) or good prognosis (n = 92) group. We collected serum samples and general clinical information and conducted routine blood tests. We used logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and area under the ROC curve (AUC) analyses to assess differences between groups. RESULTS: We found significant differences between groups (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval) for age (1.046, 1.005-1.09), RDW (2.012, 1.339-3.023), and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125; 1.022, 1.006-1.039); these remained risk factors for AECOPD prognosis in multivariate analyses. RDW and CA-125 in combination was significant in ROC curve analysis. The AUC of RDW, CA-125, and these combined were 0.691, 0.779, and 0.772, respectively. Patients with RDW >12.75% and CA-125 >15.65 U/mL were predicted to have poor prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: We found that RDW and CA-125 are potential prognostic indicators for AECOPD.",nocancer
"Management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has always been a challenge for physicians. Current treatment protocols may cause numerous adverse effects. Selenium is known for its putative antiinflammatory properties. Selenium is needed for the biosynthesis of enzymatically active selenoproteins, which contribute to antioxidative defense, and effective function of immune systems. Several studies have shown that patients with IBD have a lower selenium level compared to healthy subjects. Hence, experimental studies mimicking ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease investigated the effect of selenium supplementation on IBD. Previous studies indicated the following: 1) Selenoproteins can curb the inflammatory response and attenuate oxidative stress. This antiinflammatory property caused remission in animal models of colitis. 2) Selenium supports protective gut microbiota, which indirectly improves management of IBD. 3) Selenium may block some of the predominant tumorigenesis pathways proposed in colitis-associated colorectal cancer. 4) Selenium supplementation showed promising results in preliminary clinical studies, particularly in patients with selenium deficiency. While selenium supplementation seems to be beneficial for IBD, clinical studies have remained too preliminary in this regard. Randomized clinical trials are needed to measure the short-term and long-term effects of selenium on both active and quiescent IBD, particularly in patients with IBD who have documented selenium deficiency.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to investigate the application of core needle biopsy through the trocar hole during surgery on endoscopically unresectable giant colon polyps. METHODS: The clinical data of 51 patients with endoscopically unresectable giant colon polyps from May 2016 to May 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The primary observational outcomes were two comparative analyses of pathologic results, using the kappa index: comparison of the pathologic results from the preoperative colonoscopy and the postoperative pathologic results and comparison of the intraoperative pathologic results from core needle biopsy of the intestinal wall and the postoperative pathologic results. The secondary observational outcomes were duration of needle biopsy, operation duration, volume of intraoperative hemorrhage, rate of postoperative wound infection, rate of abdominal cavity infection, length of stay, and number and positivity of lymph node dissections after laparoscopic radical resection of colon cancer. RESULTS: Poor consistency was found between the preoperative (colonoscopy) and postoperative pathologic results, with kappa = 0.222 (i.e., kappa < 0.4), P < 0.05. However, good consistency was found between the intraoperative (core needle biopsy) and postoperative pathologic results, with kappa = 0.923 (i.e., kappa >= 0.75), P < 0.05. The postoperative pathologic results were as follows: 7 cases of adenomatous polyps of the colon, 12 cases of low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, 12 cases of high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, and 25 cases of invasive colon cancer. There was no incision infection, no abdominal cavity infection or formation of an abdominal abscess, no anastomotic leakage, and no death for any of the 51 patients. Postoperative complications occurred in two cases (3.92%). CONCLUSION: Biopsy through the trocar hole during laparoscopic surgery produced highly accurate pathologic results and was a fast, safe, and effective diagnostic method. Pathologic results from intraoperative biopsy could accurately determine the nature of colon polyps and provide a basis for choosing an appropriate surgical scheme.",nocancer

"Credible detection and quantification of low abundance proteins from human blood plasma is a major challenge in precision medicine biomarker discovery when using mass spectrometry (MS). In this proof-of-concept study, we employed a mixture of selected recombinant proteins in DDA libraries to subsequently identify (not quantify) cancer-associated low abundance plasma proteins using SWATH/DIA. The exemplar DDA recombinant protein spectral library (rPSL) was derived from tryptic digestion of 36 recombinant human proteins that had been previously implicated as possible cancer biomarkers from both our own and other studies. The rPSL was then used to identify proteins from nondepleted colorectal cancer (CRC) EDTA plasmas by SWATH-MS. Most (32/36) of the proteins used in the rPSL were reliably identified from CRC plasma samples, including 8 proteins (i.e., BTC, CXCL10, IL1B, IL6, ITGB6, TGFalpha, TNF, TP53) not previously detected using high-stringency protein inference MS according to PeptideAtlas. The rPSL SWATH-MS protocol was compared to DDA-MS using MARS-depleted and postdigestion peptide fractionated plasmas (here referred to as a human plasma DDA library). Of the 32 proteins identified using rPSL SWATH, only 12 could be identified using DDA-MS. The 20 additional proteins exclusively identified using the rPSL SWATH approach were almost exclusively lower abundance (i.e., <10 ng/mL) proteins. To mitigate justified FDR concerns, and to replicate a more typical library creation approach, the DDA rPSL library was merged with a human plasma DDA library and SWATH identification repeated using such a merged library. The majority (33/36) of the low abundance plasma proteins added from the rPSL were still able to be identified using such a merged library when high-stringency HPP Guidelines v3.0 protein inference criteria were applied to our data set. The MS data set has been deposited to ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository (PXD022361).",nocancer
"Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a typical immune checkpoint protein, whose up-regulation on the membrane of different tumor cells inhibits the immune response of T cells and leads to the escape of tumor cells. In this work, we designed a facile and highly specific surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor to detect PD-L1 in human plasma based on magnetite nanorods containing ordered mesocages (MNOM) and silver nanoclusters (AgNCs). Magneto-optical nanocomplex MNOM@AgNCs with superior magneto-optical properties and high signal-to-noise ratio were fabricated to improve the detection sensitivity owing to the high specific surface area of MNOM and excellent localized SPR of AgNCs. The PD-L1 Antibody on the surface of gold chip and the PD-L1 aptamer on MNOM@AgNCs could realize dual selective recognition of PD-L1, providing the specificity of the sensor and reducing non-specific binding. The SPR sensor showed a good linear range of PD-L1 from 10 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL with the detection limit of 3.29 ng/mL. The practical performance of this immunosensing platform had been successfully verified by clinical samples which included healthy donors and cancer patients. Based on the analysis, the developed immunosensor provided a new strategy for point-of-care detection of PD-L1 and could be used as clinical companion diagnosis of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of the contrast images obtained with a Primovist  (gadoxetate disodium) Magnetic Resonance Image in order to diagnose benign, malignant and malformations in the urinary tract. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective image and diagnosis review of Primovist  MRI studies performed in liver insufficient patients without apparent renal abnormalities was done, in order to evaluate the urinary tract for irregularities. RESULTS: A total of 117 Primovist  MRI studies performed between july 2014 and November 2018 were reviewed, 5 were excluded because they were incomplete. The average age was 59.6 +- 16.6 years old. The following diagnosis were encountered: 36 simple cysts, 6 perirenal fibrosis after pyelonephritis, 1 renal cancer, 1 renal atrophy, 1 proximal uretheric flexure, 1 bilateral hydronephrosis due to lower urinary obstruction because of benign prostatic hyperplasia and 1 complex cyst. No MRI study was indicated with suspicions of renal abnormalities. Relevant images are included that demonstrate the capability of Primovist  MRI to diagnose renal abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Even though none of the Primovist  MRI studies was done with suspicious of renal abnormalities it was possible to diagnose incidental benign, malignant and malformations of the urinary tract.

"PURPOSE: To establish a framework for the standardization of monitoring radiotherapy protocol compliance. METHODS: An automated protocol compliance tool was developed using best practice in software design and a flexible framework to easily adapt to changing institutional standards. The Eclipse scripting environment was used to develop the application with the scripting application programing interface (API) and direct data extraction from ARIA. For each institutional protocol, external validation was specified in a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file that stores protocol specific constraints and evaluates compliance of the data from Eclipse and Aria. This tool was applied prospectively to a cohort of prostate cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy with a prescription regimen of 60 Gy in 20 fractions. RESULTS: The prospective evaluation was performed on 58 prostate cancer patients. For this cohort, the mean (standard deviation) pass rate is 92.3% (6.1%). The overall fail rate is 6.0% (5.8%); the percentage of these failures is in 2.6% in Patient Assessment, 0% in Simulation, and 97.4% in Treatment Planning. CONCLUSIONS: A protocol compliance application is developed and implemented in a standard radiotherapy information system. The application functionality is demonstrated on a cohort of 58 patients undergoing prostate radiotherapy, which highlights the utility of assessing adherence to institutional protocols. A unified method must be available for the community to ensure consistency in compliance reporting.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Pre-loss grief (PLG) has been identified as a robust risk factor for Prolonged Grief Disorder, which will be added to the DSM 5-TR. Therefore, identifying treatment targets to reduce PLG is warranted. ""Preparedness"" has been found to strongly predict PLG. The work is nascent and a consensus has not been reached about how best to assess for preparedness, and no reliable measure of this construct exists. Before examining the relationship between preparedness and PLG, an in depth understanding of how family members define preparedness is warranted. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop a preliminary theoretical framework of preparedness for the loss. METHODS: This was achieved through prospective semi-structured interviews with family members of Stage 4 Cancer (N = 16) and Advanced Dementia (N = 24) patients. RESULTS: The overarching theme related to preparedness for the loss was the need to reduce uncertainty, both before the person passes away (i.e., present certainty) and after the person passes away (i.e., future certainty). Factors associated with the need to establish certainty in the present included, religiosity and spirituality, good relationship quality with the person with the life limiting illness, having access to support, good communication with person with life limiting illness, and acceptance of the impending death. Certainty for the future included, knowing what to expect due to past experience of loss, having plans for life without the person, and social support. CONCLUSION: This study provides a preliminary framework of preparedness for family members of individuals with life limiting illness.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: A pharmacokinetic analysis of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data is subject to inaccuracy and instability partly owing to the partial volume effect (PVE). We proposed a new multi-compartment model for a tissue-specific pharmacokinetic analysis in DCE-MRI data to solve the PVE problem and to provide better kinetic parameter maps. METHODS: We introduced an independent parameter named fractional volumes of tissue compartments in each DCE-MRI pixel to construct a new linear separable multi-compartment model, which simultaneously estimate pixel-wise time-concentration curves and the fractional volumes without the need of the pure-pixel assumption. This simplified convex optimization model was solved using a special type of non-negative matrix factorization algorithm (NMF) called the minimum volume constraint NMF (MVC-NMF). RESULTS: To test the model, a synthetic dataset was established based on the general pharmacokinetic parameters. On well-designed synthetic data, the proposed model reached lower bias and lower root mean square fitting error compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm in different noise levels. In addition, the real dataset from QIN-BREAST-DCE-MRI was analyzed, and we observed an improved pharmacokinetic parameter estimation to distinguish the treatment response to chemotherapy applied to breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Our model improved the accuracy and stability of the tissue-specific estimation of the fractional volumes and kinetic parameters in DCE-MRI data, and improved the robustness to noise, providing more accurate kinetics for more precise prognosis and therapeutic response evaluation using DCE-MRI.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The 5-color Nutri-Score (5-CNS) front-of-package labeling system classifies products according to their nutritional quality, so healthier choices are easier when shopping. OBJECTIVES: We examined the association between 5-CNS-based food consumption and long-term mortality in a Spanish, adult population. METHODS: We recruited 12,054 individuals, representative of the Spanish population aged >=18 years, in 2008-10 and followed up with them to 2017. Habitual food consumption was collected at baseline with a validated computerized dietary history, conducted by trained interviewers. Based on nutritional quality, foods consumed were categorized into 5 labels [A/Green (best quality), B, C, D, and E/Red (worst quality)] using an established algorithm. For each individual, a 5-CNS dietary index (DI) was calculated by summing up the amount of g/day from the foods consumed by their corresponding nutritional quality rate (e.g., A rated 1 and E rated 5) and dividing it by kg of weight. The associations between baseline 5-CNS DI and mortality were analyzed using multivariate-adjusted Cox models. RESULTS: After a mean follow-up of 8.7 years, 514 deaths occurred (140 cardiovascular and 144 cancer deaths). The all-cause mortality HR for the highest versus the lowest quartile of baseline 5-CNS DI was 1.93 (95% CI, 1.34-2.79; P-trend, 0.001). The association was slightly higher for cardiovascular mortality and was similar for cancer. Those with the highest intake of foods labeled as D or E also had a higher all-cause mortality risk than those with the lowest intake (HR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.56-2.97; P-trend < 0.001). Further, the isocaloric replacement of food products labeled as D or E with fresh foods decreases the risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of poor nutritional quality 5-CNS-labeled food products was associated with higher mortality in Spain. Pending further studies, these findings provide additional evidence to reinforce food policies on the use of this simple labeling tool at a country level.",nocancer
"The human health risks caused by heavy metal contamination (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Ni, and Zn) in the surface water of the Houjing River, the most contaminated river in southern Taiwan, were assessed in this study. Firstly, heavy metal contamination was evaluated by the contamination factors (CF) and the metal indexes (MI). Secondly, the human health risks due to heavy metal contamination were simulated using the Adaptive Risk Assessments Modeling System (ARAMS) through three scenarios; fish ingestion, dermal water contact, and incidental water ingestion during swimming. The hazard quotient (HQ) and the hazard index (HI) were used to evaluate non-carcinogenic risks, while carcinogenic risks were estimated by the lifetime cancer incidence risk index (CR) and the cumulative cancer risk (CCR). The results showed that the synergistic contamination of heavy metals in the surface water was severe (MI = 12.4), with the highest contribution from Cu, Ni, and Pb. Copper had the highest non-carcinogenic risk at the ""adverse effect"" level, while Ni and Cr had the highest carcinogenic risk at an ""unacceptable"" level. In addition, the cumulative risks of fish ingestion (HIFI = 6.75 and CCRFI = 1.25E-03) were significantly higher than those of the swimming scenarios (HI(DC + WI) = 1.94E-03 and CCR(DC + WI) = 9.32E-08). The results from this study will be beneficial for immediate and future contamination control measures and human health management plans for this study area. This study has also demonstrated the effectiveness of using ARAMS in human health risk assessment.",nocancer
"Normal tissue complication and development of radioresistance in cancer cells are known as the main challenges of ionizing radiation treatment. In the current study, we intended to induce selective radiosensitization in HT29 cancer cells by developing folic acid modified magnetic triblock copolymer nanoparticles as carrier of 5-Flourouracil (5-FU) which was further used in combination with hyperthermia. The aforementioned nanoparticles were synthesized and characterized by differential scanning calorimetric analysis (DSC), UV-visible spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), zeta sizer, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These nanoparticles were also assessed to determine drug loading capacity (DLC %) and drug release profile. The cytotoxicity of nanoparticles was evaluated on two different cell lines: HUVEC and HT29. Furthermore, radiosensitivity induction of the nanoparticles with and without exposure of alternative magnetic field was investigated. MTT-based cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that the therapeutic ratio was enhanced in response to using 5-FU-loaded nanoparticles as compared to 5-FU. Various characterizations including gene expression study, measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, Annexin V/PI staining, and clonogenic assay revealed that ionizing radiation in combination with hyperthermia in the presence of the synthesized nanoparticles led to maximal anti-cancer effects as compared to other single (P < 0.001) and combined treatments (P < 0.01). Our results suggested that combined treatment based on using folic acid modified magnetic copolymer nanoparticle as carrier of 5-FU accompanied with hyperthermia could be proposed as an efficient approach to enhance radiation effects in cancer cells.",nocancer
"Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) is a tumor-associated antigen and immunotherapy target in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Further information is needed on the characteristics of WT1-specific CD8 + T cells to develop immunotherapeutic strategies for MDS. To clarify the frequency, distribution, and phenotype of WT1-specific CD8 + T cells, which occur innately in MDS patients, we analyzed paired peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples from 39 patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. The median frequency of WT1 tetramer-binding CD8 + T cells in the CD8 + T cell population was 0.11% in PB and 0.18% in BM. A further tetramer assay combined with mixed lymphocyte peptide culture (MLPC assay) was used to detect functional WT1-specific CD8 + T cells that could respond to the WT1 peptide. Functional WT1-specific CD8 + T cells were detected in BM in 61% of patients, which was significantly higher than in PB (23%, p = 0.001). The frequency of these cells estimated by the MLPC assay was tenfold higher in BM than in PB. The majority of WT1 tetramer-binding CD8 + T cells in BM had a unique phenotype with co-expression of CD39 and CXCR4. These findings will facilitate the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies for MDS.",nocancer
"The transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) like MoS2 and WS2 are a new and interesting class of materials and show considerable promise for use in a wide variety of fields, including nanomedicine for cancer. The eco-friendly, biodegradability, toxicity, and antimicrobial activity remain an open issue. Herein, we focused on the current demands of two dimensional (2D) TMDCs and produced high-quality, few-layered MoS2 nanosheets. Noble metal Ag incorporated into the 2D-CS/MoS2 NC by the liquid exfoliated process. The manufactured CS/MoS2/Ag hybrid NC showed excellent antibacterial activity against two microorganisms such as Gram-positive (21, 27, and 33 mm) and Gram-negative bacteria (23, 30, and 39 mm). The CS/MoS2/Ag hybrid NC was designed to have significant antibacterial activity against E.coli bacteria than S.aureus. Furthermore, the hybrid NC has a 74.18% cell inhibition against MCF-7 cancer cells. According to the literature relevant, it is the first extensive experimental analysis on the nano-bio interaction of 2D TMDCs nanomaterials in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.",nocancer
"Kras and Braf are major oncogenes. The mutation of Kras codon 12 or Braf V600E can lead to ovarian carcinoma. The detection of oncogene-related DNAs and their mutations offers solution for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Herein, a size-tunable multi-functional DNA hexahedral-nanostructure (DHN) has been rationally designed and modified on the electrode to response to Kras and Braf DNA. The size of DHN is controlled via polyadenines (polyA). The complete self-assembly of DHN depends on the presence of both target DNAs and two assistant probes. Meanwhile, a HRP-mimicking DNAzyme forms in DHN, which catalyzes the polymerization of aniline. The produced polyaniline is utilized as the output signal through differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). The biosensor shows the linear range from 100 fM to 1 muM, with the detection limit of 48.7 fM for Kras gene; and the linear range from 100 fM to 100 nM, with the detection limit of 44.1 fM for Braf gene, respectively. Since the current response depends on both gene sequences, the high specificity of the biosensor endows it to operate in an ""OR""-type logic gate to discriminate the mutation of both genes. When Kras codon 12 or Braf V600E mutation happens, the response decreases significantly due to the incomplete formation of DNAzyme in DHN. The practicability of the biosensor has been verified through challenging human serum samples. Thus, it has great potential for clinical diagnosis of ovarian cancer through simultaneous detection of Kras and Braf genes and their mutations.",nocancer
"The last decade has seen exciting advances in the development of potential stem cell-based therapies for Parkinson's disease (PD), which have used different types of stem cells as starting material. These cells have been developed primarily to replace dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra that are progressively lost in the disease process. The aim is to largely restore lost motor functions, whilst not ever being curative. We discuss cell-based strategies that will have to fulfill important criteria to become effective and competitive therapies for PD. These criteria include reproducibly producing sufficient numbers of cells with an authentic substantia nigra dopamine neuron A9 phenotype, which can integrate into the host brain after transplantation and form synapses (considered crucial for long-term functional benefits). Furthermore, it is essential that transplanted cells exhibit no, or only very low levels of, proliferation without tumor formation at the site of grafting. Cumulative research has shown that stem cell-based approaches continue to have great potential in PD, but key questions remain to be answered. Here, we review the most recent progress in research on stem cell-based dopamine neuron replacement therapy for PD and briefly discuss what the immediate future might hold.   2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND/AIM: To describe the clinical progress and management of ocular side effects in a 35-year-old patient with metastatic breast cancer who underwent oral chemotherapy with capecitabine and lapatinib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Slit lamp evaluation revealed bilateral perikeratic hyperemia, perilimbal conjunctival edema associated with corneal marginal infiltrates and epithelial and anterior stromal defects in both eyes. Slit lamp examination, in vivo confocal microscopy and anterior-segment optical coherence tomography were highly suggestive for limbal stem cell deficiency. The decision to administer autologous blood- derived serum eye drops was made. RESULTS: Following administration of autologous blood-derived serum eye drops, corneal marginal infiltrates, epithelial and stromal defects significantly regressed in both eyes after only 10 days. Chemotherapy was resumed and serum eye drops were prescribed simultaneously. CONCLUSION: Autologous blood-derived serum eye drops may be an adequate therapeutic choice for bilateral corneal lesions detected as ocular side effects of capecitabine.",nocancer
"Introduction: Individual acupuncture (AP) is the gold standard method of AP delivery for cancer-related pain; however, costs can be prohibitive. Group AP allows four to six patients to be treated in a single session. This study sought to examine the cost-utility of group AP compared with individual AP from a patient perspective. Materials and Methods: Effectiveness and cost data from a noninferiority randomized trial of group versus individual AP for cancer-related pain were used. In the trial, 74 patients were randomly assigned to individual or group AP treatments twice per week for 6 weeks. The EuroQol five-dimension five level questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was used to assess health-related quality of life, and the EQ-5D Utility Index was used as a composite measure constituted of five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, anxiety-depression, and pain-discomfort). Linear mixed models were used to compare the change in EQ-5D-5L states pre-post intervention between the two arms. A cost-utility analysis was performed in terms of the incremental costs per additional quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Results: Group AP participants experienced more significant relief in the pain-discomfort subscale of the EQ-5D-5L measure compared with individual AP participants (group x time, F = 6.18; p = 0.02). The effect size on pain-discomfort for group AP (d = 0.80) was higher than that of individual AP (d = 0.34). There were no significant differences between the two study arms for other subscales of the EQ-5D-5L over time. QALYs at 6 weeks were slightly higher for group AP (0.020) compared with individual AP (0.007) leading to an incremental QALY gained by the group arm of 0.013, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.07). The cost of delivering AP treatment for the group arm over 6 weeks ($201.25) was nearly half of the individual arm ($400). Conclusions: Group AP was superior to individual AP in cancer patients. These findings have implications for the use of group AP in low-resource settings and in health care systems where AP for cancer patients is not covered by public health insurance.

"PURPOSE: The surgical navigation system that provides guidance throughout the surgery can facilitate safer and more radical liver resections, but such a system should also be able to handle organ motion. This work investigates the accuracy of intraoperative surgical guidance during open liver resection, with a semi-rigid organ approximation and electromagnetic tracking of the target area. METHODS: The suggested navigation technique incorporates a preoperative 3D liver model based on diagnostic 4D MRI scan, intraoperative contrast-enhanced CBCT imaging and electromagnetic (EM) tracking of the liver surface, as well as surgical instruments, by means of six degrees-of-freedom micro-EM sensors. RESULTS: The system was evaluated during surgeries with 35 patients and resulted in an accurate and intuitive real-time visualization of liver anatomy and tumor's location, confirmed by intraoperative checks on visible anatomical landmarks. Based on accuracy measurements verified by intraoperative CBCT, the system's average accuracy was 4.0 +- 3.0 mm, while the total surgical delay due to navigation stayed below 20 min. CONCLUSIONS: The electromagnetic navigation system for open liver surgery developed in this work allows for accurate localization of liver lesions and critical anatomical structures surrounding the resection area, even when the liver was manipulated. However, further clinically integrating the method requires shortening the guidance-related surgical delay, which can be achieved by shifting to faster intraoperative imaging like ultrasound. Our approach is adaptable to navigation on other mobile and deformable organs, and therefore may benefit various clinical applications.",nocancer
"Precision medicine is an emerging and important field for health care. Molecular tumor boards use a combination of clinical and molecular data, such as somatic tumor mutations to decide on personalized therapies for patients who have run out of standard treatment options. Personalized treatment decisions require clinical data from the hospital information system and mutation data to be accessible in a structured way. Here we introduce an open data platform to meet these requirements. We use the openEHR standard to create an expert-curated data model that is stored in a vendor-neutral format. Clinical and molecular patient data is integrated into cBioPortal, a warehousing solution for cancer genomic studies that is extended for use in clinical routine for molecular tumor boards. For data integration, we developed openEHR Mapper, a tool that allows to (i) process input data, (ii) communicate with the openEHR repository, and (iii) export the data to cBioPortal. We benchmarked the mapper performance using XML and JSON as serialization format and added caching capabilities as well as multi-threading to the openEHR Mapper.",nocancer
"The unique combination of physical and optical properties of silica (core)/gold (shell) nanoparticles (gold nanoshells) makes them especially suitable for biomedicine. Gold nanoshells are used from high-resolution in vivo imaging to in vivo photothermal tumor treatment. Furthermore, their large scattering cross-section in the second biological window (1000-1700 nm) makes them also especially adequate for molecular optical coherence tomography (OCT). In this work, it is demonstrated that, after suitable functionalization, gold nanoshells in combination with clinical OCT systems are capable of imaging damage in the myocardium following an infarct. Since both inflammation and apoptosis are two of the main mechanisms underlying myocardial damage after ischemia, such damage imaging is achieved by endowing gold nanoshells with selective affinity for the inflammatory marker intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), and the apoptotic marker phosphatidylserine. The results here presented constitute a first step toward a fast, safe, and accurate diagnosis of damaged tissue within infarcted hearts at the molecular level by means of the highly sensitive OCT interferometric technique.",nocancer
"In recent years, PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors based on monoclonal antibodies have revolutionized cancer therapy, but there still exist unresolved issues, such as the high cost, the relatively low response rates, and so on, compared with small-molecule drugs. Herein a type of pyrrole-imidazole (Py-Im) polyamide as a small-molecule DNA binder was designed and synthesized, which could competitively bind to the same double-stranded DNA stretch in the PD-L1 promoter region as the STAT3 binding site and thus downregulate PD-L1 expression. It was demonstrated that the Py-Im polyamides directly caused apoptosis in tumor cells and retarded cell migration in the absence of T cells through inhibiting the Akt/caspase-3 pathway. Also, in a coculture system, they enhanced the T-cell-mediated killing of tumor cells by the reversal of immune escape. Because such polyamides induced antitumor effects via both immune and nonimmune pathways, they could be further developed as promising PD-L1 gene-targeting antitumor drugs.",nocancer
"Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a unique form of pancreatitis often associated with infiltration of immunoglobulin G4-positive cells, a swollen pancreas, and diffuse narrowing of the pancreatic ducts. Unlike acute pancreatitis, AIP is rarely complicated with pseudocysts. Pancreatic calculi, a feature of ordinary chronic pancreatitis, are unusual during short-term follow-up in patients with AIP. We herein describe a 46-year-old man who initially presented with a submucosal tumor of the stomach. The patient was finally diagnosed with AIP accompanied by a pancreatic tail pseudocyst located in the gastric wall and pancreatic calculi by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration. He underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, pancreatic duct stent placement, and steroid treatment and achieved good clinical and laboratory responses. Although AIP is a common autoimmune disease that responds well to steroids, pseudocysts and pancreatic calculi are rare manifestations of AIP and should be given special attention, especially in patients with disease relapse.",nocancer
"Developments in mass spectrometry (MS)-based analyses of glycoproteins have been important to study changes in glycosylation related to disease. Recently, the characteristic pattern of oxonium ions in glycopeptide fragmentation spectra had been used to assign different sets of glycopeptides. In particular, this was helpful to discriminate between O-GalNAc and O-GlcNAc. Here, we thought to investigate how such information can be used to examine quantitative proteomics data. For this purpose, we used tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled samples from total cell lysates and secreted proteins from three different colorectal cancer cell lines. Following automated glycopeptide assignment (Byonic) and evaluation of the presence and relative intensity of oxonium ions, we observed that, in particular, the ratio of the ions at m/z 144.066 and 138.055, respectively, could be used to discriminate between O-GlcNAcylated and O-GalNAcylated peptides, with concomitant relative quantification between the different cell lines. Among the O-GalNAcylated proteins, we also observed anterior gradient protein 2 (AGR2), a protein which glycosylation site and status was hitherto not well documented. Using a combination of multiple fragmentation methods, we then not only assigned the site of modification, but also showed different glycosylation between intracellular (ER-resident) and secreted AGR2. Overall, our study shows the potential of broad application of the use of the relative intensities of oxonium ions for the confident assignment of glycopeptides, even in complex proteomics datasets.",nocancer
"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer with high morbidity and mortality in women. This study aimed to explore the potential mechanism of costunolide inducing MCF-7 cells apoptosis by multi-spectroscopy, molecular docking, and cell experiments. The results manifested that costunolide interacted with calf thymus DNA (ct-DNA) in a spontaneous manner, and the minor groove as the preferential binding mode. Furthermore, costunolide inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation. Hoechst 33258 staining showed that cell apoptosis induced by costunolide might be related to DNA damage. The apoptosis mechanism relied on regulating the protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2, p53, Caspase-3 and the activation of p38MAPK and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathways. This study will provide some experimental basis and potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment.",nocancer
"Efficient and multiple analysis of receptor protein dimers is highly necessary, due to their important role in the occurrence and development of cancer. Herein, we report a turn-on strategy to visualize human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) dimers on cell surfaces. By taking advantages of specific aptamer recognition and proximity-induced fluorescence activation of DNA-templated sliver nanoclusters (DNA/AgNCs) by guanine (G)-rich sequence, we attached the two kind of DNA/AgNCs sequence with different fluorescence properties to the corresponding HER aptamer to form aptamer-functionalized AgNCs probes, and attached G-rich sequence to the corresponding HER aptamer as enhancer. In the presence of protein dimers, after aptamer specific recognition and binding, it will draw the dark AgNCs probes close to the G-rich probes and then excite corresponding fluorescence. As a result, this approach has successfully realized imaging of HER2:HER2 homodimer and HER2:HER3 heterodimer at the same time, which was provided a new idea for the simultaneous detection of multiple HER2 dimers in situ. This AgNCs-based light up strategy provides a potential tool for further investigation of protein dimerization on cell surface, which is more conducive to the mechanism research, accurate classification and treatment of cancer.",nocancer
"Olfactory receptors (ORs) account for 49% of all G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are important targets for drug discovery, and hence ORs may also be potential drug targets. Various ORs are expressed in breast cancer cells; however, most of them are orphan receptors, and thus, their functions are unknown. Herein, we present an experimental strategy using a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system and a cell-based assay that allowed the identification of orphan OR6M1 as a new anticancer target in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. After the construction of stable OR6M1-expressing cells, the SPR-based screening of 108 chemicals for ligand activity was performed against OR6M1-expressing whole cells (primary screening) or membrane fragments (secondary screening). As a result, anthraquinone (AQ) and rutin were discovered to be new OR6M1 ligands. Based on calcium imaging in OR6M1-expressing Hana3A cells, AQ and rutin were classified as an OR6M1 agonist and antagonist, respectively. Cell viability and live/dead assays showed that AQ induced the death of MCF-7 cells, which was inhibited by rutin. Therefore, OR6M1 may be considered an anticancer target, and AQ may be considered a chemotherapeutic agent. This combined method can be widely used to discover the ligands and functions of other orphan GPCRs.",nocancer
"Overexpression of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), is an important factor leading to multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer treatments. Three subclasses of dual inhibitors of P-gp and BCRP were designed based on the active moieties of BCRP inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and P-gp inhibitors, of which compound 21 possessed low cytotoxicity, high reversal potency, and good lipid distribution coefficient. 21 also increased the accumulation of Adriamycin (ADM) and Mitoxantrone (MX), blocked Rh123 efflux, and made no change in the protein expression of P-gp and BCRP. Importantly, coadministration of 21 can significantly improve the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel (PTX). It was also demonstrated that 21 significantly inhibited the growth of K562/A02 xenograft tumors by increasing the sensitivity of ADM in vivo. In summary, 21 has the potential to overcome MDR caused by P-gp and BCRP and to improve the oral bioavailability of PTX.",nocancer
"Genome-wide screenings of ""essential genes"", i.e., genes required for an organism or cell survival, have been traditionally conducted in vitro in cancer cell lines, limiting the translation of results to other tissues and non-cancerous cells. Recently, an in vivo screening was conducted in adult mouse striatum tissue, providing the first genome-wide dataset of essential genes in neuronal cells. Here, we aim to investigate the role of essential genes in brain development and disease risk with a comprehensive set of bioinformatics tools, including integration with transcriptomic data from developing human brain, publicly available data from genome-wide association studies, de novo mutation datasets for different neuropsychiatric disorders, and case-control transcriptomic data from postmortem brain tissues. For the first time, we found that the expression of neuronal essential genes (NEGs) increases before birth during the early development of human brain and maintains a relatively high expression after birth. On the contrary, common essential genes from cancer cell line screenings (ACEGs) tend to be expressed at high levels during development but quickly drop after birth. Both gene sets were enriched in neurodevelopmental disorders, but only NEGs were robustly associated with neuropsychiatric disorders risk genes. Finally, NEGs were more likely to show differential expression in the brains of neuropsychiatric disorders patients than ACEGs. Overall, genome-wide central nervous system screening of essential genes can provide new insights into neuropsychiatric diseases.",nocancer

"Isolongifolanone is a high value-added sustainable natural product. Recent studies have demonstrated that isolongifolanone possesses anticancer activities. In this study, a series of novel pyrazole ring-containing isolongifolanone derivatives was designed, synthesized, and their anti-proliferative activities in three cancer cell lines were evaluated. Among them, compound 3b exhibited strongest antiproliferative ability on MCF-7 cancer cells and induced the generation of intracellular ROS and mitochondrial depolarization. More importantly, compound 3b still maintained antitumor activity in MCF-7 3D culture systems. The study on molecular mechanism suggested that compound 3b induced apoptosis via activation of caspase-3 and PARP, also via decreasing of Bcl-2 and increasing of Bax and p53. Moreover, compound 3b down-regulated the level of CDK2, a crucial cyclin-dependent kinase which is necessary for the progression of the cells out of the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Docking results showed that compound 3b could bind well with CDK2 by forming hydrogen bonds with amino acid residues (LYS89 and HIS84). These results suggested that compound 3b could be taken as a lead compound for anticancer agents.",nocancer
"Chemotherapy efficiency of platinum(II) (Pt(II)) is often attenuated owing to the low intracellular drugs concentration and glutathione (GSH)-mediated detoxification. To address these problems, we fabricated a step-by-step responsive nanogel (~160 nm) by copolymerization between four functional monomers. Hydrophilic methoxypolyethylene glycols (mPEG) distributedrandomly on the surface of particles endowed the nanogel with ""stealth"" property in blood circulation, while the chemical crosslinking inside particles by platinum(IV) (Pt(IV)) linker remarkably increased the stability of nanogel in vivo. These advantages of nanogels leaded to higher accumulation at tumor region (6.4% ID/g), followed by triggering the dePEGylation effect by the cleavage of ortho ester at tumoral extracellular pH. Meanwhile, the exposed phenylboric acid (PBA) could significantly increase cellular uptake and intracellular drugs levels by targteing sialic acid residues on the cells membrane. More importantly, this nanogels could further deplete intracellular glutathione (GSH) by the dual-regulation of platinum(IV) and arylboronic ester, resulting in enhanced platinum(II) toxicity both in vitro and in vivo, eventually achieving superior inhibition rate (79.14%) in A549/DDP tumor. Thus, the sequentially responsive nanogel could be considered as an effective strategy for cancer treatment.",nocancer

"Most anticancer drugs are not orally bioavailable due to their undesirable physicochemical properties and inherent physiological barriers. In this study, a polymeric prodrug strategy was presented to enhance the oral bioavailability of BCS class IV drugs using paclitaxel (PTX) as the model drug. PTX was covalently conjugated with cholic acid-functionalized PEG by a redox-sensitive disulfide bond. Cholic acid-functionalized PEGylated PTX (CPP) achieved remarkably improved PTX solubility (> 30,000-fold), as well as favorable stability under the physiological environment and controlled drug release in the tumor. Meanwhile, CPP could self-assemble into nanoparticles with an average size of 56.18 +- 2.06 nm and drug loading up to 17.6% (w/w). Then, permeability study on Caco-2 cell monolayers demonstrated that CPP obtained an approximately 4-fold increase by apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) mediated transport, compared with Taxol . Pharmacokinetic studies carried out in rats confirmed that the oral bioavailability of CPP was 10-fold higher than that of Taxol . Finally, significant improvement in the antitumor efficacy of CPP against breast cancer was confirmed on MDA-MB-231 cells. In summary, this prodrug-based cascade strategy offers new ways for chemotherapeutic drugs whose oral delivery is limited by solubility and permeability, also endows drugs with the capacity of tumor-specific release.",nocancer
"SMAD4, a key regulator of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling, plays a major role in cell growth, migration, and apoptosis. In particular, TGF-beta/SMAD induces growth arrest, and SMAD4 induces the expression of target genes such as p21WAF1 and p15INK4b through its interaction with several cofactors. Thus, inactivating mutations or the homozygous deletion of SMAD4 could be related to tumorigenesis or malignancy progression. However, in some cancer types, SMAD4 is neither mutated nor deleted. In the current study, we demonstrate that TGF-beta signaling with a preserved SMAD4 function can contribute to cancer through associations with negative pathway regulators. We found that nuclear respiratory factor-1 (NRF1) is a novel interaction SMAD4 partner that inhibits TGF-beta/SMAD4-induced p15INK4b mRNA expression by binding to SMAD4. Furthermore, we confirmed that NRF1 directly binds to the core region of the SMAD4 promoter, thereby decreasing SMAD4 mRNA expression. On the whole, our data suggest that NRF1 is a negative regulator of SMAD4 and can interfere with TGF-beta/SMAD-induced tumor suppression. Our findings provide a novel perception into the molecular basis of TGF-beta/SMAD4-signaling suppression in tumorigenesis.",nocancer
"Considerations regarding clinical effectiveness and cost are essential in comparing the overall value of two treatments. There has been growing interest in methodology to integrate cost and effectiveness measures in order to inform policy and promote adequate resource allocation. The net monetary benefit aggregates information on differences in mean cost and clinical outcomes; the cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was developed to characterize the extent to which the strength of evidence regarding net monetary benefit changes with fluctuations in the willingness-to-pay threshold. Methods to derive insights from characteristics of the cost/clinical outcomes besides mean differences remain undeveloped but may also be informative. We propose a novel probabilistic measure of cost-effectiveness based on the stochastic ordering of the individual net benefit distribution under each treatment. Our approach is able to accommodate features frequently encountered in observational data including confounding and censoring, and complements the net monetary benefit in the insights it provides. We conduct a range of simulations to evaluate finite-sample performance and illustrate our proposed approach using simulated data based on a study of endometrial cancer patients.",nocancer
"The anti-cancer therapeutic application of Galbanic acid (Gba) as a strong antiangiogenic sesquiterpene coumarin has been limited due to its low water solubility. This issue necessitates developing new liposomal formulations for the efficient delivery of Gba in vivo. In this study, various liposomal formulations were prepared by a thin-film hydration method, and Gba was incorporated into the liposomal bilayers, which consequently increased its release profile compared to formulations in our previous study prepared by remote loading methods. The most stable formulation with desired properties was selected and decorated with RGD peptide (cyclo [Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Cys]) to target tumor vasculature actively. The fluorescently-labeled model liposomes showed that the targeting could improve the receptor-mediated endocytosis of the liposomes higher than those prepared in our previous study in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), which was confirmed by chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis (CAM) model in vivo. Although not significant, it also could increase the accumulation of liposomes in colon tumors. In BALB/c mice bearing colon cancer, not only non-targeted Gba liposomes but also even RGD-targeted ones combinatorial therapy with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin could improve the anti-tumor efficacy as compared to their monotherapy. These outcomes have strong consequences for cancer therapy.",nocancer
"Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunit beta (IKKbeta) is a key regulator of the cannonical NF-kappaB pathway. IKKbeta has been validated as a drug target for pathological conditions, which include chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. Pharmacological studies revealed that chronic administration of ATP-competitive IKKbeta inhibitors resulted in unexpected toxicity. We previously reported the discovery of 13-197 as a non-toxic IKKbeta inhibitor that reduced tumor growth. Here, we show that 13-197 inhibits IKKbeta in a ATP non-competitive manner and an allosteric pocket at the interface of the kinase and ubiquitin like domains was identified as the potential binding site.",nocancer
"Age-adjusted rates are frequently used by epidemiologists to compare disease incidence and mortality across populations. In small geographic regions, age-adjusted rates computed directly from the data are subject to considerable variability and are generally unreliable. Therefore, we desire an approach that accounts for the excessive number of zero counts in disease mapping datasets, which are naturally present for low-prevalence diseases and are further innated when stratifying by age group. Bayesian modeling approaches are naturally suited to employ spatial and temporal smoothing to produce more stable estimates of age-adjusted rates for small areas. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal hurdle model for counts and demonstrate how age-adjusted rates can be estimated from the hurdle model. We perform a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed model vs a traditional Poisson model on datasets with varying characteristics. The approach is illustrated using two applications to cancer mortality at the county level.",nocancer
"Histone lysine demethylase 4D (KDM4D), also known as JMJD2D, plays an important role in cell proliferation and survival and has been associated with several tumor types. KDM4D has emerged as a potential target for the treatment of human cancer. Here, we reported crystal complex structures for two KDM4D inhibitors, OWS [2-(1H-pyrazol-3-yl)isonicotinic acid] and 10r (5-hydroxy-2-methylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrido[3,2-e]pyrimidine-3-carbonitrile), which were both determined to 2.0 A. OWS is a newly discovered KDM4D inhibitor (IC50 = 4.28 muM) and the critical pharmacophores of this compound are confirmed by the complex structure. Compound 10r is a KDM4D inhibitor reported by us previously. To clarify the binding mode in more detail, the crystal structure was determined and the comparison analysis revealed unique interactions that had never been observed before. Overall, our data provide new structural insights for rational design and offer an opportunity for optimization of KDM4D inhibitors.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: Comparing the characteristics of end-of-dose failure patients and non-end-of-dose failure patients in the Chinese population and exploring the factors that may affect the occurrence of end-of-dose failure in cancer pain patients. METHODS: The outpatient with cancer pain from 2016 to 2019 were collected through hospital information system, and patients were included who met the following criteria: patients with the average numerical rating scale  >=4 points within 3 days after taking the oxycodone sustained-release preparation, titrated to an effective therapeutic dose suitable for patients, had at least two clinical visits information of the patient with a minimum of >=3 days between visits, the average numerical rating scale of the next visit after the treatment of occasional pain is >=4, and were divided into end-of-dose failure group and non-end-of-dose failure group. RESULTS: Age (P < 0.05, odds ratio 0.933), diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (P < 0.05, odds ratio 0.009), pain site is the head and neck (P < 0.05, odds ratio 0.005) and the abdomen (P < 0.01, odds ratio 0.021), and the metastatic site is the liver (P < 0.05, odds ratio 0.001) are related to the occurrence of end-of-dose failure. CONCLUSIONS: Younger patients are more likely to develop end-of-dose failure. Patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal cancer, with pain in the head and neck and abdomen, and with liver metastases have a lower incidence of end-of-dose failure.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: As the field of CEST grows, various novel preparation periods using different parameters are being introduced. At the same time, large, multisite clinical studies require clearly defined protocols, especially across different vendors. Here, we propose a CEST definition standard using the open Pulseq format for a shareable, simple, and exact definition of CEST protocols. METHODS: We present the benefits of such a standard in three ways: (1) an open database on GitHub, where fully defined, human-readable CEST protocols can be shared; (2) an open-source Bloch-McConnell simulation to test and optimize CEST preparation periods in silico; and (3) a hybrid MR sequence that plays out the CEST preparation period and can be combined with any existing readout module. RESULTS: The exact definition of the CEST preparation period, in combination with the flexible simulation, leads to a good match between simulations and measurements. The standard allowed finding consensus on three amide proton transfer-weighted protocols that could be compared in healthy subjects and a tumor patient. In addition, we could show coherent multisite results for a sophisticated CEST method, highlighting the benefits regarding protocol sharing and reproducibility. CONCLUSION: With Pulseq-CEST, we provide a straightforward approach to standardize, share, simulate, and measure different CEST preparation schemes, which are inherently completely defined.",nocancer
"Traditional non-targeted chemometric workflows for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data rely on using supervised methods, which requires a priori knowledge of sample class membership. Herein, we propose a simple, unsupervised chemometric workflow known as variance rank initiated-unsupervised sample indexing (VRI-USI). VRI-USI discovers analyte peaks exhibiting high relative variance across all samples, followed by k-means clustering on the individual peaks. Based upon how the samples cluster for a given peak, a sample index assignment is provided. Using a probabilistic argument, if the same sample index assignment appears for several discovered peaks, then this outcome strongly suggests that the samples are properly classified by that particular sample index assignment. Thus, relevant chemical differences between the samples have been discovered in an unsupervised fashion. The VRI-USI workflow is demonstrated on three, increasingly difficult datasets: simulations, yeast metabolomics, and human cancer metabolomics. For simulated GC-MS datasets, VRI-USI discovered 85-90% of analytes modeled to vary between sample classes. Nineteen out of 53 peaks in the peak table developed for the yeast metabolome dataset had the same sample index assignments, indicating that those indices are most likely due to class-distinguishing chemical differences. A t-test revealed that 22 out of 53 peaks were statistically significant (p < 0.05) when using those sample index assignments. Likewise, for the human cancer metabolomics study, VRI-USI discovered 25 analytes that were statistically different (p < 0.05) using the sample index assignments determined to highlight meaningful sample-based differences. For all datasets, the sample index assignments that were deduced from VRI-USI were the correct class-based difference when using prior knowledge. VRI-USI holds promise as an exploratory data analysis workflow for studies in which analysts do not readily have a priori class information or want to uncover the underlying nature of their dataset.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: The patient of severe psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is mainly treated with oral methotrexate, ciclosporin, and anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (TNFi). Recently, anti-interleukin-17A inhibitors (IL-17Ai) have been used in the treatment of PsA. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IL-17Ai in Japanese patients with PsA compared with those of TNFi. METHODS: This was a longitudinal and retrospective study. The study population included 31 Japanese patients with PsA. All enrolled patients fulfilled the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis. All patients were treated with TNFi or IL-17Ai. The assessed clinical manifestations were C-reactive protein (CRP)-based Disease Activity Score in 28 Joints (DAS28-CRP), disease activity in psoriatic arthritis (DAPSA), 20% achievement of American College of Rheumatology core set, swollen joint count (SJC), tender joint count (TJC), and visual analog scale (VAS). Functional ability of patients with PsA was analyzed using the modified health assessment questionnaire (mHAQ) score. We evaluated the parameters at baseline and weeks 12, 24, and 52. RESULTS: The change in SJC, TJC, VAS, mHAQ, and DAPSA had no significant difference at weeks 12, 24, and 52. The improvements of CRP and DAS28-CRP were significantly higher in TNFi group only at week 12. The biologics retention rate was significantly higher in TNFi group by the log-rank test. No critical adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Our study presented that IL-17Ai had treatment effects comparable to TNFi. IL-17Ai might have the potential to become an alternative to the previous drug, but more large-scale studies are expected.",nocancer
"Densazalin, a polycyclic alkaloid, was isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona densaspicula collected in Korea. The complete structure of the compound was determined by spectroscopic methods, including 1D and 2D nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and comparison of the calculated and measured electronic circular dichroism spectra. Densazalin possesses a unique 5,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7]tridecan-2,4,6-triene moiety, which is connected by two linear carbon chains. This compound was derived from the biogenetic precursor bis-1,3-dialkylpyridnium.

"L-Asparaginase catalysing the breakdown of L-Asparagine to L-Aspartate and ammonia is an enzyme of therapeutic importance in the treatment of cancer, especially the lymphomas and leukaemia. The present study describes the recombinant production, properties and anticancer potential of enzyme from a hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrococcus abyssi. There are two genes coding for asparaginase in the genome of this organism. A 918 bp gene encoding 305 amino acids was PCR amplified and cloned in BL21 (DE3) strain of E. coli using pET28a (+) plasmid. The production of recombinant enzyme was induced under 0.5mM IPTG, purified by selective heat denaturation and ion exchange chromatography. Purified enzyme was analyzed for kinetics, in silico structure and anticancer properties. The recombinant enzyme has shown a molecular weight of 33 kDa, specific activity of 1175 U/mg, KM value 2.05mM, optimum temperature and pH 80 C and 8 respectively. No detectable enzyme activity found when L-Glutamine was used as the substrate. In silico studies have shown that the enzyme exists as a homodimer having Arg11, Ala87, Thr110, His112, Gln142, Leu172, and Lys232 being the putative active site residues. The free energy change calculated by molecular docking studies of enzyme and substrate was found as  G - 4.5 kJ/mole indicating the affinity of enzyme with the substrate. IC50 values of 5U/mL to 7.5U/mL were determined for FB, caco2 cells and HepG2 cells. A calculated amount of enzyme (5U/mL) exhibited 78% to 55% growth inhibition of caco2 and HepG2 cells. In conclusion, the recombinant enzyme produced and characterized in the present study offers a good candidate for the treatment of cancer. The procedures adopted in the present study can be prolonged for in vivo studies.",nocancer

"Silibinin is effective in significantly inhibiting the growth of cancer cells which shown significant anti-neoplastic effects in a variety of in vitro and in vivo cancer models, including skin, breast, lung, colon, bladder, prostate and kidney carcinomas. So, development of a new method to its biomedical analysis in clinical samples in highly demanded. In this study, an innovative electroanalysis method for the accurate, sensitive and rapid recognition of silibinin in human plasma samples was proposed and validated. The sensing platform was designed using silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) dispersed on the polymeric layer of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD). AgNPs with cubic shape providing a large effective surface area for beta-CD electropolymerization. So, a layer with high electron conductivity boosting the detection electrochemical signals. Also, poly(beta-CD) providing an efficient substrate with cavities to interact with silibinin and its oxidation. Differential pulse voltammetry technique was conducted to measure silibinin concentration in human real samples. Under optimized conditions, proposed sensor indicated linear relationship between the anodic peak current and concentration of silibinin in the range of 0.0103-10.3 microM on the standard and human plasma samples. Based on obtained results, proposed sensor is an efficient platform to efficient therapy of cancer based on recognition of silibinin in clinical samples.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Clostridium perfringens septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint has not been reported previously.

After assessment, he was discharged home on analgesics. Within 24 h he returned, critically ill with C. perfringens septic arthritis of the left sternoclavicular joint and septic shock. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Emergency physicians should be aware of the possibility of C. perfringens sternoclavicular joint septic arthritis in patients with unexplained chest, shoulder, or neck pain, especially when associated with a history of colorectal carcinoma or immunosuppression. A finding of C. perfringens bacteremia should prompt a search for occult gastrointestinal malignancy.",nocancer
"Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) are the enzymes of oxidoreductase family that are responsible for the aldehyde metabolism. The unbalanced expression of these enzymes may be associated with a variety of disease conditions including cancers. ALDH1A1 is one of the isoform of ALDHs majorly overexpressed in a variety of tumors and responsible for the anti-cancer drug resistance. This makes ALDH1A1 as a specific target to develop small molecule ALDH1A1 inhibitors for resistant cancer condition. Number of ALDH1A1 inhibitors have been developed and reported in the literature, but because of non-selectivity and inappropriate pharmacokinetic properties till now none of these have reached in the market for clinical use. Therefore, multiple machine learning models of different isoforms of ALDHs are integrated with in-silico techniques including virtual screening, docking, ADMET profiling, and MD simulation to identify selective ALDH1A1 inhibitors. Total ten selective ALDH1A1 inhibitors with diverse scaffolds and appropriate ADMET were identified that can be further developed as adjuvant therapy in cyclophosphamide and cisplatin resistance cancer.",nocancer

"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Minimal evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use during chemotherapy is accompanied with a high prevalence of use and nondisclosure to health professionals. This study aimed to explore patients' perspectives, experiences, support needs, and sources of information regarding CAM use during chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with ten adult participants who recently completed chemotherapy treatment at a large hospital in Australia were transcribed verbatim. Three investigators thematically analysed the interviews. RESULTS: These participants receiving chemotherapy valued CAMs as a natural complement to chemotherapy to improve wellbeing, with their use most strongly influenced by past experiences rather than expert advice. CONCLUSION: Health professionals would benefit from education on how to best inform patients of the potential risks, harms and lack of efficacy for CAM use during chemotherapy in a way that does not lead to patient non-disclosure of CAM use.",nocancer
"Cysteine (Cys), a kind of small molecule biological thiol, not only involves in the regulation of physiological processes, but also is considered a marker of tumor. However, it is challenging to develop suitable probe for detecting Cys in tumors. In this paper, a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe named IX for Cys has been designed and synthesized. The probe shows a NIR emission peak at 770 nm with large Stokes shift (180 nm) upon adding Cys. It displays high sensitivity to Cys with 6-fold increase of fluorescence intensity. Meanwhile, IX has the high selectivity to Cys over other potential interference such as Hcy and GSH, which have similar structure with Cys. In addition, a possible mechanism of fluorescence enhancement is the reaction of IX with Cys to release IX-OH, which is verified by fluorescence spectra, MS and HPLC. Next, IX can selectively image Cys in HCT-116 cells thanks to the low cytotoxicity. Most important of all, the fluorescent probe IX has visualized Cys in HCT116-xenograft tumor mice due to the near-infrared properties with large Stokes shift.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: Progranulin (PGRN) is a secreted growth factor that helps to regulate neuronal survival by blocking tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) receptors. The antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is used in diabetic neuropathy to improve nerve conduction and relieve neuropathic pain, but its effects on PGRN levels have not yet been elucidated. METHODS: In this prospective study, 54 patients with type 2 diabetes and peripheral neuropathy received 600 mg of ALA daily for 6 months. Twenty-four patients with diabetes without neuropathy were also included in the study. Serum PGRN and TNFalpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In addition, current perception threshold (CPT) testing was used to assess sensory neuropathy. RESULTS: After ALA treatment, serum PGRN levels were significantly increased and CPT values were significantly improved. Furthermore, there were significant positive correlations among TNFalpha, ICAM-1, and PGRN levels both before and after ALA treatment. A significant negative correlation was observed between the improvements in CPT and the PGRN levels. Furthermore, ICAM-1 levels were an independent predictor of PGRN levels. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in serum PGRN levels indicate that ALA treatment may have beneficial effects on endothelial function and neuronal inflammation.",nocancer
"Following an uncomplicated CT-guided transthoracic biopsy, a patient becomes unconscious and subsequently dies despite immediate cardiac resuscitation. The patient felt well during the procedure but started complaining about dizziness and chest pain when he sat up. When he again was put in a supine position, cardiac arrest was noted. A CT scan performed when the symptoms initiated was afterwards rigorously reviewed by the team and revealed air located in the left ventricle, aorta and right coronary artery.We present a rare but potentially lethal complication following CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy-systemic vascular air embolus. Knowledge and evidence about the complication are sparse because of low incidence and varying presentation. However, immediate initiation of treatment can save a life, and awareness of the complication is therefore crucial.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The endoscopic endonasal trans-lacerum approach (EETLA) is useful in handling skull base tumors around inferior petrous apex (IPA); however, its surgical corridor is exclusively a triangular space (supra-eustachian triangle [SET]), between the internal carotid artery (ICA) and eustachian tube. METHODS: We investigated correlation between SET size and extent of resection around the IPA (lateral extent of resection [EOR]) through a retrospective analysis of 15 surgeries using EETLA. RESULTS: Of 15 cases (9 chordomas, 4 chondrosarcomas, and 2 meningiomas), 20 sides of IPA were affected by the tumor. When being restricted to sides with severe lateral tumor extension beyond the midpoint of petrous ICA (10 sides), the SET size was significantly broader in the group with lateral EOR of >=90% (p value = 0.019). CONCLUSIONS: The SET size was a powerful index of tumor resectability in EETLA, especially in cases with severe tumor extension. The individual anatomical variations should be considered when determining EETLA application.",nocancer
"An impedimetric biosensor is used to measure electrical impedance changes in the presence of biomolecules from sinusoidal input voltages. In this paper, we present a new portable impedance-based biosensor platform to improve the sensitivity of immunoassays with microparticles as a label. Using a 2 x 4 interdigitated electrode array with a 10/10 mum electrode/gap and a miniaturized impedance analyzer, we performed immunoassays with microparticles by integrating a microfluidic channel to evaluate signal enhancement. First, to understand the material dependency of microparticles on the sensor array, magnetic, silica, and polystyrene microparticles were tested. Among these microparticles, magnetic microparticles presented a high signal enhancement with relevant stability from the sensor array. With the magnetic microparticles, we demonstrate a series of immunoassays to detect human tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) and compare the level of signal enhancement by measuring the limit of detection (LOD). With the microparticles, we achieved over ten times improvement of LOD from sandwich immunoassays. By incorporating with sample preparation and flow manipulation systems, this impedance sensor array can be utilized for digital diagnostics for a real sample-in answer-out system.",nocancer

"Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications (PTM) occurring in a large variety of proteins with important biological functions in human and other higher organisms. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been routinely used to characterize site-specific protein glycosylation at high throughput in complex glycoproteomic samples.

"We present a new class of derivatives of noscapine, 1,3-diynyl-noscapinoids of an antitussive plant alkaloid, noscapine based on our in silico efforts that binds tubulin and displays anticancer activity against a panel of breast cancer cells. Structure-activity analyses pointed the C-9 position of the isoquinoline ring which was modified by coupling of 1,3-diynyl structural motifs to rationally design and screened a series of novel 1,3-diynyl-noscapinoids (20-22) with robust binding affinity with tubulin. The selected 1,3-diynyl-noscapinoids, 20-22 revealed improved predicted binding energy of -6.568 kcal/mol for 20, -7.367 kcal/mol for 21 and -7.922 kcal/mol for 22, respectively in comparison to the lead molecule (-5.246 kcal/mol). These novel derivatives were chemically synthesized and validated their anticancer activity based on cellular studies using two human breast adenocarcinoma, MCF-7 and MDAMB-231, as well as with a panel of primary breast cancer cells isolated from patients. Interestingly, all these derivatives inhibited cellular proliferation in all the cancer cells that ranged between 6.2 to 38.9 muM, which is 6.7 to 1.5 fold lower than that of noscapine. Unlike previously reported derivatives of noscapine that arrests cells in the S-phase, these novel derivatives effectively inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, arrests cell cycle in the G2/M-phase followed by apoptosis and appearance of apoptotic cells. Thus, we conclude that 1,3-diynyl-noscapinoids have great potential to be a novel therapeutic agent for breast cancers.",nocancer
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a significant increase in the use of non-contact infrared devices for screening the body temperatures of people at the entrances of hospitals, airports, train stations, churches, schools, shops, sports centres, offices, and public places in general. The strong correlation between a high body temperature and SARS-CoV-2 infection has motivated the governments of several countries to restrict access to public indoor places simply based on a person's body temperature. Negating/allowing entrance to a public place can have a strong impact on people. For example, a cancer patient could be refused access to a cancer centre because of an incorrect high temperature measurement. On the other hand, underestimating an individual's body temperature may allow infected patients to enter indoor public places where it is much easier for the virus to spread to other people. Accordingly, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the reliability of body temperature measurements has become fundamental. In particular, a debated issue is the reliability of remote temperature measurements, especially when these are aimed at identifying in a quick and reliable way infected subjects. Working distance, body-device angle, and light conditions and many other metrological and subjective issues significantly affect the data acquired via common contactless infrared point thermometers, making the acquisition of reliable measurements at the entrance to public places a challenging task. The main objective of this work is to sensitize the community to the typical incorrect uses of infrared point thermometers, as well as the resulting drifts in measurements of body temperature. Using several commercial contactless infrared point thermometers, we performed four different experiments to simulate common scenarios in a triage emergency room. In the first experiment, we acquired several measurements for each thermometer without measuring the working distance or angle of inclination to show that, for some instruments, the values obtained can differ by 1  C. In the second and third experiments, we analysed the impacts of the working distance and angle of inclination of the thermometers, respectively, to prove that only a few cm/degrees can cause drifts higher than 1  C. Finally, in the fourth experiment, we showed that the light in the environment can also cause changes in temperature up to 0.5  C. Ultimately, in this study, we quantitatively demonstrated that the working distance, angle of inclination, and light conditions can strongly impact temperature measurements, which could invalidate the screening results.",nocancer
"Gene expression regulation by small interfering RNA (siRNA) holds promise in treating a wide range of diseases through selective gene silencing. However, successful clinical application of nucleic acid-based therapy requires novel delivery options. Herein, to achieve efficient delivery of negatively charged siRNA duplexes, the internal cavity of ""humanized"" chimeric Archaeal ferritin (HumAfFt) was specifically decorated with novel cationic piperazine-based compounds (PAs). By coupling these rigid-rod-like amines with thiol-reactive reagents, chemoselective conjugation was efficiently afforded on topologically selected cysteine residues properly located inside HumAfFt. The capability of PAs-HumAfFt to host and deliver siRNA molecules through human transferrin receptor (TfR1), overexpressed in many cancer cells, was explored.

"PURPOSE: Despite the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocol, length of stay (LOS) after colorectal surgery varies considerably. The majority of longer admissions is often not medically necessary. We aimed to investigate possible reduction of LOS by perioperative education with an expected discharge date (EDD). METHODS: This single-centre retrospective study included 578 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in 2016 with standard care (ERAS) and in 2018 with the addition of EDD education program (ERAS+). A comparison was made of a 1-year period prior to and following the implementation of EDD. The EDD was discussed at the outpatient clinic, preoperatively and during admission (with both the patient and family members daily). Standard EDD varied between 3 and 5 days depending on the resection type. Primary outcome was LOS; secondary outcomes were readmission, serious complications and 90-day mortality. RESULTS: Patients in ERAS+ (n = 242) had a shorter median LOS (4.0 vs. 5.0, p < 0.001) compared to patients in the regular ERAS group (n = 336). Fewer patients of ERAS+ experienced postoperative complications (71 (29.3%) vs. 198 (58.9%), p < 0.001). No difference was found in the number of readmissions (23 (9.5%) vs. 34 (10.1%), p = 0.807), reinterventions (25 (10.3%) vs. 30 (8.9%), p = 0.571) or mortality (5 (2.1%) vs. 9 (2.7%), p = 0.261) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: It is possible to reduce LOS within the ERAS program, by better perioperative education and expectation management of patients with use of an EDD. This program ensures better understanding, faster discharge and lower costs for the hospital without added risk of readmissions or complications.",nocancer
"The fused heterocyclic ring system has been recognized as a privileged structure, which is used as a template in medicinal chemistry for drug discovery. Benzimidazole is one of the common scaffolds found in several natural products such as histidine, purines, and an integral part of vitamin B12. This hetero-aromatic bicyclic ring system acts as a pharmacophore in various drugs of therapeutic interest and has a broad spectrum of activities. Literature reports suggest that diversely substituted benzimidazoles possess distinct pharmacological profiles with multi-targeting potential, thereby, an indispensable anchor for the development of novel therapeutic agents against complex diseases such as cancer, malaria, inflammatory disorders, microbial diseases, hypertension, etc. Thus, lots of research efforts have been diverted towards exploring the therapeutic potential of benzimidazoles. Despite great efforts made by the research community, still, some multi-factorial diseases continue to progress due to their complex pathophysiology. Under these sets of circumstances, there is a need to explore this nucleus for hybrid designing with multi-targeting potential against complex diseases. These benzimidazole-based hybrids have been reported to treat multifactorial diseases, making it a scaffold of interest for various pharmaceutical companies and research groups.

"The protective role of high high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) against cardiovascular risk has been questioned recently. Due to the increasing trend of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in Tunisia, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of high HDL-C and its associated factors in Tunisian women of childbearing age. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a subsample of 1689 women, aged 20 to 49 years, in the Great Tunis region. Data on socio-demographic and lifestyle factors were collected by a questionnaire. Overall adiposity was assessed by body mass index (BMI). All biological variables were assayed in blood samples coated with anticoagulant ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA) by enzymatic methods. Stata software (2015) was used for data management and statistical analysis. High HDL-C values were recorded in 26.6% of selected women. After adjustment for all socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, age, hypertension, and smoking were negatively associated with high HDL-C levels, while family history of cancer was positively associated with high HDL-C in women. An additional investigation on the relationship between high HDL-C and cancer risk should be performed due to controversial results.",nocancer
"Hupehenenine is a novel isosteroid alkaloid which was firstly isolated from Bulbus Hupehensis Fritillariae. The inhibitory proliferation effect of hupehenenine and its three related alkaloid derivatives including o-caproyl-hupehenenine, o-(2-furanoyl)-hupehenenine and Delta5(6) -isopeimine on human lung cancer cell line, human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line and human thyroid duct cancer cell line in vitro had been identified. In this study, we firstly developed a sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to simultaneous quantification of hupehenenine and three alkaloid derivatives in rat plasma and tissues. The developed method was validated and it was linear over the concentration range of 1-800 ng/mL for all analytes with R2 >= 0.9939 and 0.9972 respectively in rat plasma and rat liver homogenate. The lower limit of quantitation was 1 ng/mL for all analytes. The intra-day and inter-day precision and accuracy were satisfactory. This validated method was successfully applied to investigate pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of hupehenenine in rats. In pharmacokinetic study, the maximum plasma concentration exists gender difference. Tissue distribution study showed that hupehenenine has good affinity for multiple tissues but is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier. These results may provide useful reference for further research of hupehenenine and its three related alkaloid derivatives.",nocancer
"PM2.5 and PM10 samples were collected from the outdoor environment of five types of cities (provincial central cities, regional central cities, resource-based cities, agricultural cities, and forested cities) situated in Northeast China. Based on bioaccessibility and respiratory deposition fluxes, health risks of PM2.5- and PM10-bound six heavy metals [HM6: Arsenic (As), Chromium (Cr), Cadmium (Cd), Nickel (Ni), Cobalt (Co), and Lead (Pb)] were studied. Cobalt (Co) and Cr were found to be the most abundantly bioaccessible fraction among HM6 after extraction of simulated lung fluids. After inhalation exposure, among HM6, Co mainly contributed 88.39-93.19% to the non-carcinogenic risk, while Cr account for 82.92-93.72% of cancer risk. The estimated daily intake of bioaccessible HM6 in outdoor environment during the heating period was calculated to be 293.11 +- 121.03, 117.08 +- 32.46, 105.57 +- 32.49, 100.35 +- 25.58 and 83.11 +- 17.64 ng/h for provincial central cities, regional central cities, agricultural city, resource-based cities and forested cities, respectively, for local residents. During the heating period of 180 days, non-carcinogenic risks (As, Cr, Cd, Ni, Co) in outdoor environment of 0.5 residence time were below the safety threshold (HQ < 1). Cancer risks for Cr and Co were above 10-5 in the five types of cities, but in the assumable range (< 10-4). Our study highlighted the wide range of measures needed to cut airborne particles pollution to safer levels.",nocancer
"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors are increasingly used for various autoimmune diseases. Demyelinating events in the CNS, including myelitis, are reportedly associated with TNF-alpha inhibitor exposure. Behcet's disease rarely involves the spinal cord. A 51-year-old Japanese woman presented with back pain, leg weakness, and numbness during golimumab administration, a TNF-alpha inhibitor, for Behcet's disease. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multifocal myelitis in the cervical and thoracic spinal cords. Discontinuation of golimumab and steroid therapy were effective and the symptoms have not relapsed. Although it is possible that the patient's myelitis was part of the symptoms of neuro-Behcet's disease, we believe that golimumab likely played a role in the myelitis development.",nocancer
"According to the European statistics, approximately 26 million patients worldwide suffer from heart failure (HF), and this number seems to be steadily increasing. Inflammation plays a central role in the development of HF, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) represents inflammation gold-standard biomarker. Early detection plays a crucial role for the prognosis and treatment of HF. An Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET) based on silicon nitride transducer and biofunctionalized with anti-TNF-alpha antibody for label-free detection of salivary TNF-alpha is proposed. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used for TNF-alpha detection. Our ImmunoFET offered a detection limit of 1 pg mL-1, with an analytical reproducibility expressed by a coefficient of variance (CV) resulted < 10% for the analysis of saliva samples, and an analyte recovery of 94 +- 6%. In addition, it demonstrated high selectivity when compared to other HF biomarkers such as Inteleukin-10, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and Cortisol. Finally, ImmunoFET accuracy in determining the unknown concentration of TNF-alpha was successfully tested in saliva samples by performing standard addition method. The proposed ImmunoFET showed great promise as a complementary tool for biomedical application for HF monitoring by a non-invasive, rapid and accurate assessment of TNF-alpha.",nocancer
"This study aims to study the chemical components from the gum resin of Boswellia carterii. Five cembranoid diterpenes were isolated from the gum resin of B. carterii by various of column chromatographies including silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and semi-preparative HPLC. Their structures were identified on the basis of physicochemical properties, mass spectrometry(MS), nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR), Ultraviolet(UV) and infrared(IR) spectroscopic data.

"Chylothorax after esophagectomy is a serious complication that is associated with major morbidity due to dehydration and malnutrition. Reoperation with ligation of the thoracic duct is considered for patients with high-output chyle leaks that have failed conservative management. In this report, we present the treatment options for chylothorax after esophagectomy: inguinal intranodal lymphangiography and transvenous retrograde thoracic duct embolization. A 74-year-old man with esophageal cancer had been operated with thoracoscopic esophagectomy. Six days after surgery, he presented with high-output chyle leaks. Conservative treatment did not result in a significant improvement. Inguinal intranodal lymphangiography and transvenous retrograde thoracic duct embolization were performed 13 days after surgery and were technically and clinically successful. Inguinal intranodal lymphangiography and transvenous retrograde thoracic duct embolization are an effective treatment option, especially for patients after esophagectomy with reconstruction performed via the posterior mediastinal route, without the potential for damage the gastric tube and omentum.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: According to previous reports, surgery is not recommended until at least 4 weeks after the symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 resolve. However, strong evidence has not been established regarding the optimal timing and preoperative examination for elective laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal cancer in individuals with a previous coronavirus disease 2019 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old Asian man underwent elective laparoscopic colectomy for sigmoid colon cancer 3 weeks after asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019. The postoperative course was good, and none of the surgical staff was infected with coronavirus disease 2019. CONCLUSION: In this patient infected with coronavirus disease 2019 within 4 weeks of surgery, preoperative venous ultrasound of the lower extremities and a chest computed tomography scan were useful examinations for ensuring a safe surgical procedure for the patient and the staff. Surgery within 4 weeks may be possible with careful selection of cases based on thorough preoperative examination. This report may contribute to the development of a consensus on performing safe elective colectomy for colon cancer in persons previously infected with coronavirus disease 2019.",nocancer
"The dose of administered chemotherapy drugs is crucial to determine due to the potential for efficient or adverse outcomes for cancer patients. To date, no user-friendly and low-cost method of doxorubicin (DOX) detection using nontoxic and biodegradable materials has been reported. For this reason, in this work, we have developed for the first time a nanofiber-based sensing platform for sensitive and on-site DOX assay in just 10 min. This is obtained thanks to printable, porosity and embeddability features of electrospun nanofibrous films (ENFFs) combined with nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon dots (NS-CDs) as sensing probes. The assay was done by just pipetting analyte on the hydrophilic spots of the fabricated photoluminescence water-stable ENFFs where the color intensity was being darkened. DOX quenched NS-CDs fluorescence onto ENFFs through inner filter effect. The developed sensor was either coupled with smartphone technology to provide miniaturized, portable and easy-to-use device or an ordinary spectrofluorimeter for solid-state sensing applications (detection limit of 5.4 nM). Moreover, applicability of the designed sensor was evaluated in human serum with satisfactory recoveries. It is more interesting that the fabricated NS-CDs/ENF scaffolds have a high potential to detect the intracellular DOX to enhance cell proliferation leading to be considered as a multimodal tool in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",nocancer
"Intravascular lobular capillary hemangioma (ILCH) is a rare variant of pyogenic granuloma, which develops within the lumen of a blood vessel. Here, we report the case of a 38-year-old male presenting with a mobile, incompressible, nonpulsatile nodule in the superficial fascia of the forearm. A first ultrasonographic examination diagnosed the mass as intravascular thrombosis with partial recanalization. Three months later, a second ultrasonographic examination concluded to the existence of an intravascular tumor, which finally turned out at pathological examination to be ILCH. Here, we report the ultrasonographic features of ILCH and the differential diagnosis between ILCH and other intravascular masses like thrombus.",nocancer
"In this study, we developed a fully integrated protein absolute quantification platform for simultaneous analysis of multiple tumor markers in human plasma, by which multiple target proteins (alpha-fetoprotein, prostate-specific antigen, carcino-embryonic antigen and mucin-1) were firstly enriched by aptamers immobilized capillary column using graphene oxide modified polymer microsphere as the separation matrix, and then the eluted target proteins were online denatured, reduced, desalted and digested by our developed fully automated sample treatment device (FAST), finally the resulting peptides were analyzed by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) on LTQ-orbitrap velos mass spectrometry. Compared to traditional ELISA assay, the platform exhibited significant advantages such as short analysis time, low limit of detection, and ease of automation. Furthermore, our developed platform was also applied in the absolute quantification of tumor markers from clinical human plasma samples, and the results were comparable to those obtained by clinical immunoassay. All the results demonstrated that such a platform could provide a promising tool for achieving high sensitivity, high accuracy, and high throughput detection of disease related protein markers in the routine physical examination and clinical disease diagnosis.",nocancer
"The tumor suppressor gene HIC1 (Hypermethylated in Cancer 1) encodes a transcriptional repressor involved in the DNA-damage response. A SUMOylation increase on HIC1 Lysine314 favors the direct transcriptional repression of SIRT1 and thus the P53-dependent apoptotic response to irreparable DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). HIC1 is also essential for DSBs repair but in a SUMOylation-independent manner. Here, we show that repairable DSBs induced by a 1 h Etoposide treatment results in three specific posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of HIC1. Two of these PTMs, phosphorylation of Serine 694 and Acetylation of Lysine 623 are located in the conserved HIC1 C-terminal region located downstream of the Zinc Finger DNA-binding domain. By contrast, phosphorylation of Serine 285 found in the poorly conserved central region is unique to the human protein. We showed that Ser694 phosphorylation is mediated mainly by the PIKK kinase ATM and is essential for the DNA repair activity of HIC1 as demonstrated by the lack of efficiency of the S694A point mutant in Comet assays. Thus, our results provide the first evidence for a functional role of the conserved HIC1 C-terminal region as a novel ATM substrate that plays an essential role in the cellular HIC1-mediated cellular response to repairable DSBs.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To describe the surgical approach to the treatment of iatrogenic gynecomastia via peri-areolar incision. METHODS: In this study, we describe our experience in the surgical management of iatrogenic hormonal gynecomastia with our technique described for idiopathic gynecomastia. We treated 70 patients with gynecomastia at a plastic surgery unit between 2000 and 2016. Ten of these patients had a painful hypertrophic mammary gland with grade III gynecomastia secondary to hormone therapy after prostate cancer. RESULTS: The presence of a very discreet scar around the areola often has very interesting aesthetic results. Areolar tissue sensation was completely preserved in 40% of patients. No short-term complications were observed; in follow-up, only one case of keloid scars was noted on a patient with dark skin, and only one case of areolar necrosis on a patient with critical breast ptosis. CONCLUSION: This technique is feasible. It restores almost normal anatomy structure with minimal scarring and preserves good regional neurovascular supply, with only 60% altered areolar sensation.",nocancer
"The nanoscale spatial organization of transmembrane tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptors has been implicated in the regulation of cellular fate. Accordingly, molecular tools that can induce specific arrangements of these receptors on cell surfaces would give us an opportunity to study these effects in detail. To achieve this, we introduce DNA origami nanostructures that precisely scaffold the patterning of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-mimicking peptides at nanoscale level. Stimulating human breast cancer cells with these patterns, we find that around 5 nm is the critical interligand distance of hexagonally patterned peptides to induce death receptor clustering and a resulting apoptosis. We thus offer a strategy to reverse the non-efficacy of current ligand- and antibody-based methods for TNF superfamily activation.",nocancer
"Celiac plexus neurolysis has been associated with orthostatic hypotension but has not been quantified prospectively or evaluated for persistence after the immediate postprocedural period.

While the analgesic benefit of celiac plexus neurolysis is clear, the observed hemodynamic changes may be poorly tolerated in some individuals.",nocancer
"ABSTRACT: A 60-year-old woman with surgically confirmed immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT due to significantly elevated serum CA-19-9 level, which revealed a hypermetabolic lesion in the residual liver. 68Ga-FAPI PET/MR was performed to further evaluate whether the FDG-avid lesion is a malignant tumor. Astonishingly, diffuse intense radioactivity was revealed throughout the liver, suggesting involvement of active immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis, but nonfocal elevated 68Ga-FAPI accumulation in the FDG-avid lesion indicated postoperative change. From this case, we speculated that FAPI imaging could be used for evaluation of chronic liver disease because fibroblast activation protein has a profibrogenic role in chronic liver injury.",nocancer

"OBJECTIVE: This study aims at developing a pipeline that provides the capability to include the catheter effect in the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the cardiovascular system and other human vascular flows carried out with the open-source software SimVascular. This tool is particularly useful for CFD simulation of interventional radiology procedures such as tumor embolization where estimation of a therapeutic agent distribution is of interest. RESULTS: A pipeline is developed that generates boundary condition files which can be used in SimVascular CFD simulations. The boundary condition files are modified such that they simulate the effect of catheter presence on the flow field downstream of the inlet. Using this pipeline, the catheter flow, velocity profile, radius, wall thickness, and deviation from the vessel center can be defined. Since our method relies on the manipulation of the boundary condition that is imposed on the inlet, it is sensitive to the mesh density. The finer the mesh is (especially around the catheter wall), the more accurate the velocity estimations are. In this study, we also utilized this pipeline to qualitatively investigate the effect of catheter presence on the flow field in a truncated right hepatic arterial tree of a liver cancer patient.",nocancer
"Organoselenium compounds have attracted growing interests as promising antitumor agents over recent years. Herein, four series of novel selenium-containing chiral 1,4-diarylazetidin-2-ones were asymmetrically synthesized and biologically evaluated for antitumor activities. Among them, compound 7 was found to be about 10-fold more potent than its prototype compound 1a, and compound 9a exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity against five human cancer cell lines, including a paclitaxel-resistant human ovarian cancer cell line A2780T, with IC50 values ranging from 1 to 3 nM. Mechanistic studies revealed that compound 9a worked by disrupting tubulin polymerization, inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, blocking the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, inducing cellular apoptosis and suppressing angiogenesis. Additionally, compound 9a exhibited appropriate human-microsomal metabolic stability and physicochemical properties. Importantly, compound 9a was found to inhibit tumor growth effectively in a xenograft mice model with low toxicity profile, which rendered 9a a highly promising candidate for further pre-clinical development.",nocancer
"Background. Evolutionary theory-driven alcohol prevention programs for adolescents are lacking. This study introduced a binge drinking impression formation paradigm to test whether emphasizing sexual dysfunction induced by alcohol abuse lowers positive attitudes and expectancies related to binge drinking when compared with cognitive or long-term health consequences. Method. In a between-subjects experiment, 269 French high school students (age, M = 15.94, SD = 0.93, 63.20% women) watched professional-quality videos emphasizing sexual impotence (n = 60), cognitive impairment (n = 72), or long-term effects (cancer, cardiovascular disease, n = 68) induced by alcohol and then had to evaluate a drinking scene. We predicted that the video on impotence would be the most impactful when compared with the other videos. Results. Results showed that women evaluated the target as less attractive after viewing the cognitive video compared with the video on impotence. Men were more willing to play sports against the target after viewing the cognitive video, compared with the video on impotence. Conclusions. These results showed that evolutionary meaning might shape impressions formed by participants depending on the context. This study calls for further replications using the same design and materials.",nocancer
"MXene quantum dots have attracted much attention due to their great optical performance and excellent water solubility. Glutathione (GSH) plays a key role in living cells. In this study, a biocompatibility nanoprobe was prepared for detecting intracellular GSH based on MXene N-Ti3C2 quantum dots (N-Ti3C2 QDs). The N-Ti3C2 QDs act as the fluorescence reporters and the ferric iron (Fe3+) as the quenchers based on nonradiative electron-hole annihilation. When Fe3+ encounters the amino group of N-Ti3C2 QDs, the electrons of N-Ti3C2 QDs in the excited state will transfer to the half-filled 3d orbitals of Fe3+, leading to the fluorescence quenching of N-Ti3C2 QDs. When the N-Ti3C2 QDs/Fe3+ nanoprobe acts on the cancer cell MCF-7, the abundant GSH in the cancer cells can reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+, which will restore the fluorescence of N-Ti3C2 QDs. The N-Ti3C2 QDs/Fe3+ nanoprobe displays a high sensitivity for GSH with a detection limit of 0.17 muM in range of 0.5-100 muM. It becomes a promising probe for detecting and showing cellular imaging of GSH in MCF-7 cells.

"Chondroitin AC lyase can efficiently hydrolyze chondroitin sulfate (CS) to low molecule weight chondroitin sulfate, which has been widely used in clinical therapy, including anti-tumor, anti-oxidation, hypolipidemic, and anti-inflammatory. In this work, a novel chondroitin AC lyase from Pedobacter xixiisoli (PxchonAC) was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The characterization of PxchonAC showed that it has specific activities on chondroitin sulfate A, Chondroitin sulfate C and hyaluronic acid with 428.77, 270.57, and 136.06 U mg-1, respectively. The Km and Vmax of PxchonAC were 0.61 mg mL-1 and 670.18 U mg-1 using chondroitin sulfate A as the substrate. The enzyme had a half-life of roughly 660 min at 37  C in the presence of Ca2+ and remained a residual activity of 54 % after incubated at 4  C for 25 days. Molecular docking revealed that Asn123, His223, Tyr232, Arg286, Arg290, Asn372, and Glu374 were mainly involved in the substrate binding. The enzymatic hydrolysis product was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography, demonstrating PxchonAC could hydrolyze CS efficiently.",nocancer
"Understanding and amelioration of the effects of solar radiation exposure are critical in preventing the occurrence of skin cancer. Towards this end, many studies have been conducted in 2D cell culture models under simplified and unrealistic conditions. 3D culture models better capture the complexity of in vivo physiology, although the effects of the 3D extracellular matrix have not been well studied. Monitoring the instantaneous and resultant cellular responses to exposure, and the influence of the 3D environment, could provide an enhanced understanding of the fundamental processes of photocarcinogenesis. This work presents an analysis of the biochemical impacts of simulated solar radiation (SSR) occurring in immortalised human epithelial keratinocytes (HaCaT), in a 3D skin model, compared to 2D culture. Cell viability was monitored using the Alamar Blue colorometric assay (AB), and the impact of the radiation exposure, at the level of the biomolecular constituents (nucleic acids and proteins), were evaluated through the combination of Raman microspectroscopy and multivariate statistical analysis. The results suggest that SSR exposure induces alterations of the conformational structure of DNA as an immediate impact, whereas changes in the protein signature are primarily seen as a subsequent response.

"BACKGROUND Anti-TNF-alpha therapies were the first class of biologics to be used in treatment of moderate to severe IBD. Immunosuppression status that develops from using anti-TNF-a therapies increases the risk of serious and opportunistic infections. We present here a rare case of serious infection that developed in an IBD patient while on anti-TNF therapy. CASE REPORT Our patient was a 14-year-old boy with a history of chronic sinusitis and ulcerative colitis who had been on infliximab therapy for the last 3 years. He presented with facial swelling and worsening constant frontal headache. Imaging showed frontal scalp subgaleal abscess, mild frontal calvarial early osteomyelitis, bilateral preseptal cellulitis, and acute and chronic paranasal sinus disease. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and underwent sinus surgery with incision and drainage of the forehead abscess. He recovered well and resumed his infliximab infusions 3 weeks after the surgery. CONCLUSIONS PPT is a serious complication of untreated sinusitis. IBD patients on biologics can have higher risk of developing such complications because of their decreased ability to fight infections. Although the risk of serious infections declines significantly after the first year of using biologics, physicians should keep a low threshold for investigating symptomatic patients for serious infections, as they require prompt intervention. Despite the potential complications from using biologics, the benefits of this therapy in IBD patients outweigh the risks.",nocancer
"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an extremely rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder leading to mature ossification within soft tissues. We report a 62-year-old female with a 3-week history of a rapidly enlarging left neck mass with no associated symptoms. A neck CT showed a ~10 cm solid-appearing non-calcified left neck mass that markedly decreased in size on a one-month follow-up neck MRI, but with new extensive edema/intense enhancement in floor of the mouth. Prior radiographs documented hallux valgus and heterotopic ossification of the psoas/paraspinal muscles and shoulder girdle. In this case of FOP, no intervention was implemented and the symptoms improved over time and thus paralleled other such cases for flare-ups. Clinicians should be aware of this rare entity, as it is frequently misdiagnosed as cancer or other benign entities such as infection, resulting in biopsies that can often hasten disease progression.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the association between cardiovascular medications prescribed at ICU discharge and 1-year mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted at a single tertiary academic hospital. The study population comprised adult patients (aged >=18 years) who were admitted to the general ICU between January 2012 and December 2016, survived, and were discharged. ""Cardiovascular medication of ICU survivors"" was defined as cardiovascular medications prescribed to ICU survivors for continued use after ICU discharge. Patients who had any cardiovascular medication prescribed at ICU discharge were classified as the CV MED group (n=10,777); all other patients comprised the non-CV MED group (n=7,288). RESULTS: A total of 18,065 ICU survivors participated in this study. After propensity score (PS) matching, a total of 8,456 patients (4,228 patients per group) were included in the analysis. In a Cox regression model, overall 1-year mortality after ICU discharge was 25% lower in the CV MED group, compared to the nonCV MED group (HR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.84; P<0.001). In competing risk analysis, cancer-related 1-year mortality was 26% lower in the CV MED group (HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.62 to 0.89; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed associations of various cardiovascular medications at ICU discharge with decreases in 1-year overall mortality among ICU survivors. This association was more evident for cancer-related 1-year mortality. Our result suggested that with proper indication, cardiovascular medications might have beneficial long-term outcomes among ICU survivors.",nocancer
"A colorimetric immunosensor was developed for the detection of tumor-associated anti-p53 autoantibodies (anti-p53aAbs). The immunosensor platform was prepared by immobilizing human-protein (p53Ag) onto a high binding 96-well plate. The immunoassay was based on the immunometric sandwich protocol, and protein G functionalized nanomagnet-silica nanoparticles decorated with Au@Pd (Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Au@Pd0.30NPs-protG) was used as the detection nanobioprobe. The Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Au@Pd0.30NPs-protG exhibited a high binding affinity for the captured anti-p53aAbs and high catalytic performance towards the oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The oxidation of TMB resulted in significant color change and a UV-vis absorption signal. The detection was achieved by measuring the changes in UV-Vis absorption as the concentrations of anti-p53aAbs changed. The apparent binding affinity (KD) between the p53aAbs and Fe3O4@SiO2-NH2-Au@Pd0.30NPs-protG was 35.2 ng mL-1. The plot of change in the absorption intensity against the logarithm of anti-p53aAbs was linear within 1.0-500.0 ng mL-1 with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.98. The detection limit (LoD) using 3sigma was calculated to be 15 pg mL-1, which is lower than the conventional HRP-label based colorimetric immunoassay. The real sample detection was investigated using the serum recovery method. The recovery of the anti-p53aAbs ranges from 98.5% to 105.7%, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.",nocancer

"Benzimidazol-amino thiazoles are synthesized under microwave irradiations using benzimidazole phenyl thiourea and 2-bromoacetophenone. Bifunctional hydrogen bonding plays an important role in chemical conversion. The reaction was carried out by C-C bond formation, followed by C-N bond cleavage and simultaneous migration of the benzimidazole ring. This reaction is novel and efficient for the synthesis of benzimidazol-amino thiazoles in which microwaves were used as driving forces. Synthesis of the product was controlled by double hydrogen bonding which is practically confirmed by the synthesis of routine imino-thiazole as an alternative product in the simple acidic condition. The simple acidic condition is neither responsible nor sufficient for optimum conversion of the benzimidazole migrated product. The synthesized products benzimidazole amino thiazoles D4 (IC50 = 4.207 muM) and D8 (IC50 = 2.398 muM) show interesting anticancer activities for human lung cancer with reference to doxorubicin (IC50 = 1.750 muM).",nocancer

Recently, cell-based selections with encoded chemical libraries have been described, commonly revealing suboptimal performance due to insufficient recovery of binding molecules. We used carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)-expressing tumor cells as a model system to optimize selection procedures with code-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) as selection readout. Salt concentration and performing PCR on cell suspension had the biggest impact on selection performance, leading to 15-fold enrichment factors for high-affinity monovalent CAIX binders (acetazolamide; K D = 8.7 nM). Surprisingly, the homobivalent display of acetazolamide at the extremities of both complementary DNA strands led to a substantial improvement of both ligand recovery and enrichment factors (above 100-fold). The optimized procedures were used for selections with a DNA-encoded chemical library comprising 1 million members against tumor cell lines expressing CAIX, leading to a preferential recovery of known and new ligands against this validated tumor-associated target. This work may facilitate future affinity selections on cells against target proteins which might be difficult to express otherwise.",nocancer
"Nicotinic ganglionic acetylcholine receptor autoantibodies (alpha-3-AChR Ab) are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes when present in low elevations. These antibodies can be tested for as part of an autoimmune encephalopathy panel in neuropsychiatric patients; a mildly elevated titre of alpha-3-AChR Ab that may start as an incidental finding can lead to the diagnosis of a previously undetected cancer. While alpha-3-AChR Ab are most typically associated with thymomas and small cell lung cancer, the presence of these antibodies can suggest a diverse range of other cancers. This case presents a patient with longstanding neuropsychiatric symptoms and possible functional hypothyroidism for whom a low elevation in alpha-3-AChR Ab led to the finding of papillary thyroid carcinoma.",nocancer
"In epidemiology, identifying the effect of exposure variables in relation to a time-to-event outcome is a classical research area of practical importance. Incorporating propensity score in the Cox regression model, as a measure to control for confounding, has certain advantages when outcome is rare. However, in situations involving exposure measured with moderate to substantial error, identifying the exposure effect using propensity score in Cox models remains a challenging yet unresolved problem. In this paper, we propose an estimating equation method to correct for the exposure misclassification-caused bias in the estimation of exposure-outcome associations. We also discuss the asymptotic properties and derive the asymptotic variances of the proposed estimators. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators in various settings. As an illustration, we apply our method to correct for the misclassification-caused bias in estimating the association of PM2.5 level with lung cancer mortality using a nationwide prospective cohort, the Nurses' Health Study. The proposed methodology can be applied using our user-friendly R program published online.",nocancer
"A 60-year-old woman with a 5-year history of anxiolytic use, a diazepam-equivalent daily dose of 15 mg, was scheduled for esophageal stent removal. She was given remimazolam (0.5 mg/kg) but remained fully alert. She only lost consciousness with propofol (40 mg). A 61-year-old man with a 1-year history of anxiolytic use, diazepam-equivalent daily dose of 20 mg, was scheduled for hand tumor resection. He was given remimazolam (0.3 mg/kg) but remained fully alert. He only lost consciousness after desflurane inhalation. In a patient with a history of long-term benzodiazepine use, anesthetic or sedative agents aside from remimazolam should be considered.",nocancer
"Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), emitted during biomass combustion, are carcinogenic chemicals. The association between indoor biomass burning and PCDD/Fs inhalation exposure levels is still poorly understood. This study first reports direct measurement of personal exposure to PCDD/Fs in real-world households with wood combustion. In homes where biomass burning is used for cooking, toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) PCDD/Fs concentrations were found to be 545 +- 251 fg I-TEQ/m3 in kitchens, with levels of 4.5-, 6.9-, and 13.3-fold higher than those in living rooms (122 +- 92 fg I-TEQ/m3), bedrooms (79 +- 27 fg I-TEQ/m3), and ambient air (41 +- 15 fg I-TEQ/m3), respectively. PCDD/Fs exposure levels in populations using biomass fuels for cooking (353 +- 110 fg I-TEQ/m3) were 4.3-fold higher than those in the control groups (82 +- 32 fg I-TEQ/m3). Additionally, the average cancer risks for biomass cooking person were approximately 3.1-fold higher than those in factory workers. Overall, residents of household that use biomass fuels for cooking have the highest known risk of PCDD/Fs exposure. These results highlight that aiming to mitigate the PCDD/Fs exposure risk in the general population, the focus of dioxin emission source control measures should shift from industrial sectors to residential biomass combustion.",nocancer
"Osteitis pubis is a rare but known complication of multiple urological procedures including transurethral resection of the prostate, prostate cryotherapy, photovaporisation of the prostate, high-intensity focused ultrasound treatment of the prostate, prostatectomy and cystectomy, especially in the context of salvage therapy for prostate cancer. Patients can present with significant often intractable pain secondary to this condition. We report a case of a patient with a history of radiation therapy and salvage cryoablation who presented with osteitis pubis, calcification of the prostatic tissue bed which was inseparable from the pubic symphysis. Treatment with salvage holmium laser enucleation of the prostate and holmium lithotripsy was demonstrated to be effective for palliative management of osteitis pubis from prostatic calcification ossifying into the pubic symphysis.",nocancer
"Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) injury is one of the main complications of total thyroidectomy. If the injury is bilateral, total airway obstruction, aphonia and hoarseness of voice could be precipitated.

"The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is an important efflux transporter in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), protecting the brain from a wide range of substances. In this study, we investigated if BCRP function is affected by bisphenol A (BPA), a high production volume chemical used in common consumer products, as well as by bisphenol F (BPF) and bisphenol S (BPS), which are used to substitute BPA. We employed a transwell-based in vitro cell model of iPSC-derived brain microvascular endothelial cells, where BCRP function was assessed by measuring the intracellular accumulation of its substrate Hoechst 33342. Additionally, we used in silico modelling to predict if the bisphenols could directly interact with BCRP. Our results showed that BPA significantly inhibits the transport function of BCRP. Additionally, BPA was predicted to bind to the cavity that is targeted by known BCRP inhibitors. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BPA inhibits BCRP function in vitro, probably by direct interaction with the transporter. This effect might contribute to BPA's known impact on neurodevelopment.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To describe the training and early implementation of the ARIA model of genetic counseling (Accessible, Relational, Inclusive, Actionable). METHODS: As part of the Cancer Health Assessments Reaching Many (CHARM) study, an interdisciplinary workgroup developed the ARIA curriculum and trained genetic counselors to return exome sequencing results using the ARIA model. CURRICULUM: The ARIA curriculum includes didactic elements, discussion, readings, role plays, and observations of usual care genetic counseling sessions. The ARIA model provides the skills and strategies needed for genetic counseling to be accessible to all patients, regardless of prior knowledge or literacy level; involves appropriate psychological and social counseling without overwhelming the patient with information; and leaves the patient with clear and actionable next steps. CONCLUSION: With sufficient training and practice, the ARIA model appears to be feasible, with promise for ensuring that genetic counselors' communication is accessible, relational, inclusive and actionable for the diverse patients participating in genomic medicine. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: ARIA offers a coherent set of principles and strategies for effective communication with patients of all literacy levels and outlines specific techniques to practice and incorporate these skills into routine practice. The ARIA model could be integrated into genetic counseling training programs and practice, making genetic counseling more accessible and meaningful for all patients.",nocancer
"The interaction of human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) and heregulin (HRG) is involved in resistance to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted cancer treatment, such as therapies using anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody. Therefore, inhibition of the HER3/HRG interaction is potentially valuable therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In this study, we used in vitro selection, also known as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) against the extracellular domain of human HER3, and discovered a novel RNA aptamer. Pull-down and bio-layer interferometry assays showed that RNA aptamer discovered specifically bound to HER3 with a dissociation constant (KD) of 700 nM. Pull-down assays using chemiluminescence detection also revealed that the HER3-binding RNA aptamer inhibited interactions between HER3 and human HRG. These results indicated that the novel HER3-binding RNA aptamer has potential to be used as basic tool in a range of applications involving HER3/HRG interactions, including research, therapeutic, and diagnostic applications.",nocancer
"Platelets play a prominent role in multiple diseases, in particular arterial and venous thrombosis and also in atherosclerosis and cancer. To advance the in vivo study of the biological activity of this cell type from a basic experimental focus to a clinical focus, new translatable platelet-specific molecular imaging agents are required. Herein, we report the development of a near-infrared fluorescence probe based upon tirofiban, a clinically approved small-molecule glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPIIb/IIIa). Through in vitro experiments with human platelets and in vivo ones in a murine model of deep-vein thrombosis, we demonstrate the avidity of the generated probe for activated platelets, with the added benefit of a short blood half-life, thereby enabling rapid in vivo visualization within the vasculature.",nocancer
"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread across the globe through the human transmission. The World Health Organization suggested social distancing to curb the community spread. After national social lockdown started in India, air quality improved drastically. This further hypothesized to influence the environment and human health, and this study is positively the first to weigh it using multiple indices. The calculated environmental indices are photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP). The cancer risk, chronic health index (CHI), and acute health index (AHI) were considered to calculate the health risk. The spatial trend change in the air pollution reflecting on these indices are calculated for four Indian megacities Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Temporal variation was accounted for monthly (2019 vs 2020), one-week and two-weeks period during the social lockdown. The results showed a significant decrease in environmental and health risk during the lockdown due to a corresponding decrement in air pollution. The decrease in the particulate matter was found to play a vital role in altering the air pollution mediated risks of interest. Delhi showed a maximum difference in POCP and Acute HI by recording a dip of 70.79% and 43.53% respectively in 2020 during lockdown. The maximum reduction in health risk indices was 41%, 31%, 17%, 19% for Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Bangalore recorded the maximum decline in EP, Cancer risk, Chronic HI by 66.66%, 58.62%, and 58.76% in 2020 compared to 2019. A maximum fall in AP was seen in Kolkata by 57.23% in 2020 among all cities. The connection between these drop-in indices and the cause of air pollutants were well discussed. This present paper gives more in-depth insights into air pollution's effect on environmental and health parameters by connecting and converging various air pollution aspects into a single scale. This study also enlightens the importance of controlling air pollution to have a better environment and healthy life to attain sustainable development.",nocancer
"Background: BF211, a derivative of bufalin (BF), shows significantly improved solubility and potent antitumor efficiency compared to BF. Unfortunately, the unwanted toxicity such as cardiotoxicity caused by unspecific distribution has hindered its clinical use. Methods: PEGylated BF211 liposomes (BF211@Lipo) were designed and optimizely prepared based on the pre-prescription research. In vitro and in vivo cardiotoxicity was evaluated. In vivo pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of BF211@Lipo were investigated. In vivo antitumor activity and toxicity were evaluated in HepG2 cell xenograft models. The rapid-release triggered by Poloxamer 188 (P188) was assessed in vitro and in vivo. Results: The optimized BF211@Lipo displayed a spherical morphology with a size of (164.6 +- 10.3) nm and a high encapsulation efficiency of (93.24 +- 2.15) %. The in vivo concentration-time curves of BF211 loaded in liposomes showed a prolonged half-life in plasma and increased tumor accumulation. No obvious abnormality in electrocardiograms was observed in guinea pigs even at 9 mg/kg. Moreover, to improve the efficient release of BF211@Lipo, a surfactant-assisted rapid-release strategy was developed, and the release-promoting mechanism was revealed by the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and fluorescence nanoparticle tracking analysis (fl-NTA) technology. Sequential injection of BF211@Lipo and P188 could ignite the ""cold"" liposomes locally in tumor regions, facilitating the burst release of BF211 and enhancing the therapeutic index. Conclusion: Our progressive efforts that begin with preparation technology and dosage regimen enable BF211 to like a drug, providing a promising nano platform to deliver the cardiac glycosides and alleviate the side effects by decreasing unspecific biodistribution.",nocancer
"Disinfection was essential to keep human healthy from microorganisms in drinking water. Meanwhile, disinfection by-products (DBPs) have been proved to be associated with some adverse health effects. The DBP levels were different in drinking water disinfected by different methods and may cause diverse health risks. However, studies in this field and systematic analysis about risk characteristics are limited. We estimated the health risks of DBPs exposure in drinking water through multi-pathways, and systematically analyzed the characteristics of different disinfection methods and influence factors of health risk of DBPs in China. Drinking water samples were collected and analyzed for DBPs from some representative water treatment plants in several typical regions in China. We adopted the additive method to estimate the health risks of DBPs exposure in drinking water through multi-pathways, and used descriptive and hierarchical analysis to understand their characteristics and influence factors. The concentrations of the six DBPs in drinking water ranged from 1.6 mug/L to 13.3 mug/L. The cumulative cancer risk of DBPs exposure through multi-pathways was 8.63 x 10-5. The total HI of DBPs exposure was 1.70 x 10-1. The health risks of DBPs in drinking water disinfected by chlorine dioxide and sodium hypochlorite were lower than by other disinfection methods. The health risk of DBPs in drinking water was dominated by risk through oral and inhalation route. The health risks in wet season were higher than that in dry season. There is no significant difference in health risk for males and females, but children experienced higher health risks than adults. Our study suggested the situation of that a large population experienced the high cancer risk of DBPs in drinking water in typical regions of China. It was suggested that potential higher risk should be concerned, and possible measures could be considered to decrease the health risks.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: Experimental studies have shown that vitamin D has an immunomodulatory effect on the innate and adaptive immune systems. Associations between vitamin D deficiency and development or progression of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are reported, but a cause-and-effect relationship between pretreatment 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and response to anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (anti-TNF) therapy is not established. METHODS: This retrospective study evaluated pediatric IBD patients who had 25(OH)D levels drawn within 3 months of initiating infliximab and/or adalimumab treatment. Demographic features, Paris classification, baseline 25(OH)D levels, disease activity, and laboratory results before and after 3 months of anti-TNF therapy were collected. The interaction between vitamin D insufficiency at induction and lack of response to anti-TNF therapy at 3 months was determined. RESULTS: Of the 383 patients, 76 met inclusion criteria. Sixty-five patients (85.5%) had Crohn disease (CD) and 11 (14.5%) had ulcerative colitis. Seven patients had 25(OH)D levels obtained during both infliximab and adalimumab induction; hence 83 subjects were evaluated (infliximab: 70 patients, adalimumab: 13 patients). 25(OH)D <30 ng/mL was found in 55 of 83 (66.3%) subjects. There were no differences in gender, IBD type, disease activity scores between vitamin D-sufficient and vitamin D-insufficient groups. In CD, proximal gastrointestinal tract inflammation was associated with vitamin D insufficiency (P = 0.019), but other Paris classification parameters and laboratory results were similar in 2 groups. Early termination of anti-TNF therapy was significantly higher in patients who had vitamin D insufficiency (14.5% vs 0%, P = 0.034). CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D insufficiency before anti-TNF treatment may result in poor response to induction therapy.",nocancer
"Nanoparticles (NPs) have attracted considerable attention in various fields, such as cosmetics, the food industry, material design, and nanomedicine. In particular, the fast-moving field of nanomedicine takes advantage of features of NPs for the detection and treatment of different types of cancer, fibrosis, inflammation, arthritis as well as neurodegenerative and gastrointestinal diseases. To this end, a detailed understanding of the NP uptake mechanisms by cells and intracellular localization is essential for safe and efficient therapeutic applications. In the first part of this review, we describe the several endocytic pathways involved in the internalization of NPs and we discuss the impact of the physicochemical properties of NPs on this process. In addition, the potential challenges of using various inhibitors, endocytic markers and genetic approaches to study endocytosis are addressed along with the principal (semi) quantification methods of NP uptake. The second part focuses on synthetic and bio-inspired substances, which can stimulate or decrease the cellular uptake of NPs. This approach could be interesting in nanomedicine where a high accumulation of drugs in the target cells is desirable and clearance by immune cells is to be avoided. This review contributes to an improved understanding of NP endocytic pathways and reveals potential substances, which can be used in nanomedicine to improve NP delivery.",nocancer
"Radon, a known carcinogen, becomes a health risk when it accumulates inside buildings. Exposure is of particular concern for children, as their longer life expectancy increases their lifetime risk of developing cancer. In 2016, 5.5 million students were enrolled in Canadian elementary and secondary schools. With no national policy on radon testing in schools, children may be at risk from radon exposure while attending school and school-based programs. This study explored radon testing efforts in publicly funded Canadian schools and summarizes where testing programs have occurred. Radon testing in schools was identified through a systematic qualitative enquiry, surveying members from different levels of government (health and education) and other stakeholders (school boards, research experts, among others). Overall, this research found that approaches to radon testing varied considerably by province and region. Responsibility for radon testing in schools was often deferred between government, school boards, building managers and construction parties. Transparency around radon testing, including which schools had been tested and whether radon levels had been mitigated, also emerged as an issue. Radon testing of schools across Canada, including mitigation and clear communication strategies, needs to improve to ensure a healthy indoor environment for staff and students.",nocancer
"Objective: Biologic therapies have dramatically changed the management of moderate to severe psoriasis; however, few US real-world studies characterize the unmet needs of patients who do not respond to biologic therapies. This study examined the characteristics at enrollment of patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who had insufficient responses to anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies (anti-TNFs). Methods: Patients enrolled in the Corrona Psoriasis Registry from April 2015 to June 2018 who initiated an anti-TNF at enrollment were stratified on the basis of body surface area (BSA) improvement to <3% or a 75% improvement from enrollment to the 6-month follow-up visit (response versus insufficient response). Patient demographics and disease characteristics were described at enrollment, and changes in outcomes were assessed at 6-month follow-up for those who received anti-TNFs. Results: Of 180 anti-TNF initiators who had >=1 follow-up visit, 50.6% were classified as responders. Logistic regression modeling showed that female sex was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of achieving a response (OR = 0.534, 95% CI = 0.289-0.988, p = .046). Conclusion: Despite the small sample size and short follow-up period, these findings may help dermatologists to identify patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who have unmet treatment needs.",nocancer
"AIM: To investigate whether TNF inhibitors (TNFi) impact spinal radiographic progression in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and whether this is coupled to their effect on inflammation. METHODS: Patients with axSpA fulfilling the modified New York criteria were included in this prospective cohort (ALBERTA FORCAST). Spine radiographs, done every 2 years up to 10 years, were scored by 2 central readers, using the modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS). The indirect effect of TNFi on mSASSS was evaluated with generalized estimating equations by testing the interaction between TNFi and ASDAS at the start of each 2-year interval (t). If significant, the association between ASDAS at t and mSASSS at the end of the interval (t+1) was assessed in: i. patients treated with TNFi in all visits; ii. some visits and iii. never treated. In addition, the association between TNFi at t and mSASSS at t+1 (adjusting for ASDAS at t) was also tested (direct effect). RESULTS: In total, 314 patients were included. A gradient was seen for the effect of ASDAS at t on mSASSS at t+1 (interaction p-value 0.10), with a higher progression in patients never treated with TNFi [beta (95% CI): 0.41 (0.13; 0.68)] compared to those continuously treated [0.16 (0.00;0.31)] (indirect effect). However, TNFi also directly slowed progression as treated patients had on average 0.85 mSASSS-units less on t+1 compared to those not treated [-0.85 (-1.35; -0.35)]. CONCLUSION: TNFi reduce spinal radiographic progression in patients with radiographic axSpA which might be partially uncoupled from their effects on ASDAS inflammation.",nocancer
"Abnormalities in the FGFRs signaling pathway and VEGFR2 amplification often occur in a variety of tumors, and they synergistically promote tumor angiogenesis. Studies have shown that the up-regulation of FGF-2 is closely related to the resistance of VEGFR2 inhibitors. Activation of the FGFRs signal is a signal of compensatory angiogenesis after VEGFR2 resistance. Dual VEGFR2/FGFR1 inhibitors contribute to overcoming the resistance of VEGFR2 inhibitors and inhibit tumor growth significantly. Based on this, we designed and synthesized a series of 4,6-disubstituted pyrimidine derivatives as dual VEGFR2/FGFR1 inhibitors by the molecular hybridization strategy. 3-(2,6-dichloro-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-(6-((4-methoxyphenyl)amino)pyrimidin-4-yl)-1-methylurea(8b) had the best inhibitory activities against VEGFR2 and FGFR1 at 10  muM (82.2% and 101.0%, respectively), it showed moderate antiproliferative activities against A549 and KG-1 cell lines as well. Besides, molecular docking was also carried out to study the binding mode of 3-(2,6-dichloro-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-(6-((4-methoxyphenyl)amino)pyrimidin-4-yl)-1-methylurea(8b) with VEGFR2 and FGFR1.

"Lipid droplets (LDs) including triacylglycerols and cholesteryl esters are applied for protein transformation and protein maturation in living bodies, which have an important effect on lipid metabolism, homeostasis, and interactions with other organelles. The imbalance of LDs could lead to many serious diseases including insulin resistance, cancer, obesity, liver disease, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disease. The diameter distribution of LDs is quite extensive from 100 nm to 100 microm. Herein, we designed and constructed a novel organic bio-probe TzAr-N for LDs cell imaging with much more hydrophobic and viscous environment compared to cytosol by using 1,3,5-triazine as electron acceptor. This sensitive probe exhibited favorable merits including large Stokes shift (almost 80 nm), good LDs targeting ability, and a low biological toxicity, which also could not be affected by wide range of pH values. Furthermore, the bio-probe TzAr-N could also mark LDs distribution in living HeLa cells.",nocancer
"Doxorubicin (Dox) is a secondary metabolite of the mutated strain of Streptomyces peucetius var. Caesius and belongs to the anthracyclines family. The anti-cancer activity of Dox is mainly exerted through the DNA intercalation and inhibiting topoisomerase II enzyme in fast-proliferating tumors. However, Dox causes cumulative and dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, which results in increased risks of mortality among cancer patients and thus limiting its wide clinical applications. There are several mechanisms has been proposed for doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity and oxidative stress, free radical generation and apoptosis are most widely reported. Apart from this, other mechanisms are also involved in Dox-induced cardiotoxicity such as impaired mitochondrial function, a perturbation in iron regulatory protein, disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis, autophagy, the release of nitric oxide and inflammatory mediators and altered gene and protein expression that involved apoptosis. Dox also causes downregulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) enzyme activity which leads to a reduction in the DNA methylation process. This hypomethylation causes dysregulation in the mitochondrial genes like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator (PGC)-1-alpha (PGC-1alpha), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1) and mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) unit in the heart. Apart from DNA methylation, Dox treatment also alters the micro RNAs levels and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Therefore, in the current review, we have provided a detailed update on the current understanding of the pathological mechanisms behind the well-known Dox-induced cardiotoxicity. Further, we have provided some of the most plausible pharmacological strategies which have been tested against Dox-induced cardiotoxicity.",nocancer
"The anthraquinone scaffold has long been known as a source of efficacious antitumor drugs. In particular, the various chemical modifications of the side chains in this scaffold have yielded the compounds potent for the wild type tumor cells, their counterparts with molecular determinants of altered drug response, as well as in vivo settings. Further exploring the chemotype of anticancer heteroarene-fused anthraquinones, we herein demonstrate that derivative of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-2-carboxamide, (compound 8) is highly potent against a panel of human tumor cell lines and their drug resistant variants. Treatment with submicromolar or low micromolar concentrations of 8 for only 30 min was sufficient to trigger lethal damage of K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Compound 8 (2.5 muM, 3-6 h) induced an apoptotic cell death as determined by concomitant activation of caspases 3 and 9, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, increase of Annexin V/propidium iodide double stained cells, DNA fragmentation (subG1 fraction) and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Neither a significant interaction with double stranded DNA nor strong inhibition of the DNA dependent enzyme topoisomerase 1 by 8 were detectable in cell free systems. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that some amount of 8 was detectable in mitochondria as early as 5 min after the addition to the cells; exposure for 1 h caused significant morphological changes and clustering of mitochondria. The bioisosteric analog 2 in which the thiophene ring was replaced with furan was less active although the patterns of cytotoxicity of both derivatives were similar. These results point at the specific role of the sulfur atom in the antitumor properties of carboxamide derivatives of heteroarene-fused anthraquinone.",nocancer
"Microfluidic enables precise control over the continuous mixing of fluid phases at the micrometre scale, aiming to optimize the processing parameters and to facilitate scale-up feasibility. The optimization of parameters to obtain monodispersed drug-loaded liposomes however is challenging. In this work, two phosphatidylcholines (PC) differing in acyl chain length were selected, and used to control the release of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin hydrochloride, an effective drug used to treat breast cancer. Microfluidics was used to rapidly screen manufacturing parameters and PC formulations to obtain monodispersed unilamellar liposomal formulations with a reproducible size (i.e. < 200 nm). Cholesterol was included in all liposomal formulations; some formulations also contained DMPC(1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) and/or DSPC(1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). Systematic variations in microfluidics total flow rate (TFR) settings were performed, while keeping a constant flow rate ratio (FRR). A total of six PC-based liposomes were fabricated using the optimal manufacturing parameters (TFR 500 muL/min, FRR 0.1) for the production of reproducible, stable liposome formulations with a narrow size distribution. Liposomes actively encapsulating doxorubicin exhibited high encapsulation efficiencies (>80%) for most of the six formulations, and sustained drug release profiles in vitro over 48 h. Drug release profiles varied as a function of the DMPC/DSPC mol content in the lipid bilayer, with DMPC-based liposomes exhibiting a sustained release of doxorubicin when compared to DSPC liposomes. The PC-based liposomes, with a slower release of doxorubicin, were tested in vitro, as to investigate their cytotoxic activity against three human breast cancer cell lines: the non-metastatic ER+/PR+ MCF7 cells, the triple-negative aggressive MDA-MB 231 cells, and the metastatic HER2-overexpressing/PR+ BT474 cells. Similar cytotoxicity levels to that of free doxorubicin were reported for DMPC5 and DMPC3 binary liposomes (IC50 ~ 1 muM), whereas liposomes composed of a single PC were less cytotoxic (IC50 ~ 3-4 muM). These results highlight that microfluidics is suitable for the manufacture of monodispersed and size-specific PC-based liposomes in a controlled single-step; furthermore, selected PC-based liposome represent promising nanomedicines for the prolonged release of chemotherapeutics, with the aim of improving outcomes for patients.",nocancer
"Syringomyelia is a rare disorder in which a fluid-filled cyst forms within the spinal cord, resulting in myelopathy. Meanwhile, the abnormal dilatation of the central canal is referred to as hydromyelia or slit-like syrinx. The most prevailing classification is based on anatomical features and pathogeny rather than pathophysiological mechanisms. It is usual to distinguish foraminal syringomyelia related mainly to abnormalities at the craniocervical junction, non-foraminal syringomyelia dealing with any cause of arachnoiditis (infection, inflammation, trauma...) and more rarely syringomyelia associated with intramedullary tumors. Although many pathophysiological theories have been argued over time, the prevailing one is that disturbances in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in the sub-arachnoid spaces disrupt flow velocity leading to the syrinx. Symptoms of paralysis, sensory loss and chronic pain commonly develop during the third/fourth decades of life. The natural history of syringomyelia is typically one of gradual, stepwise neurological deterioration extending over many years. Diagnosis is based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including excellent morphological sequences (T1-, T2-, FLAIR-, T2*-, enhanced T1-) and dynamic MRI with careful study of CSF velocity (CISS, cine-MR sequences). Surgical management is at first dedicated to treat the cause of the syringomyelia, mainly to re-establish a physiological CSF pathway in the subarachnoid spaces. Mostly, the surgical goal is to enlarge the craniocervical junction with duraplasty. Other surgical strategies such as arachnoidolysis or shunt procedures are performed based on the pathogenic mechanisms or as second-line treatment. Medical treatments are also necessary as chronic pain is the main long-lasting symptom. As evolutive syringomyelia is a severe disease with a high impact on quality of life, it is recommended to treat without delay. There is no evidence for surgery for incidental asymptomatic syringomyelia or hydromyelia. Finally, syringomyelia associated with intramedullary tumors resolves spontaneously after tumor resection. Syringomyelia is a rare disease, which requires a dedicated multidisciplinary approach, emphasizing the need for a nationwide scientific organization so as to offer optimal care to the patient.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of the Mendelsohn maneuver and swallowing training in patients with senile vascular dementia complicated with dysphagia. METHODS: We randomly classified 214 patients with senile vascular dementia and swallowing dysfunction into a control group (CG, n = 106) and observation group (OG, n = 108). Both groups underwent health education, psychological intervention, and training of the oral muscle group. The OG additionally underwent the Mendelsohn maneuver and swallowing training. The Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS), China Stroke Scale (CSS), and Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status Examination (NCSE) were used to evaluate dementia, neurological impairment, and cognitive dysfunction, respectively. RESULTS: The OG had a higher rate of effective therapy than the CG. After intervention, the OG showed better swallowing function than the CG. At 15 days and 1 month after intervention, the OG had higher video fluoroscopic swallowing exam scores than the CG. The OG had lower serum interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels than the CG. After intervention, the OG had higher HDS and NCSE scores and lower CSS scores than the CG. CONCLUSIONS: The Mendelsohn maneuver and swallowing training can improve swallowing function in patients with senile vascular dementia complicated with dysphagia and help to ameliorate the inflammatory response.",nocancer
"A highly conserved but convoluted network of neurons and glial cells, the enteric nervous system (ENS), is positioned along the wall of the gut to coordinate digestive processes and gastrointestinal homeostasis. Because ENS components are in charge of the autonomous regulation of gut function, it is inevitable that their dysfunction is central to the pathophysiology and symptom generation of gastrointestinal disease. While for neurodevelopmental disorders such as Hirschsprung, ENS pathogenesis appears to be clear-cut, the role for impaired ENS activity in the etiology of other gastrointestinal disorders is less established and is often deemed secondary to other insults like intestinal inflammation. However, mounting experimental evidence in recent years indicates that gastrointestinal homeostasis hinges on multifaceted connections between the ENS, and other cellular networks such as the intestinal epithelium, the immune system, and the intestinal microbiome. Derangement of these interactions could underlie gastrointestinal disease onset and elicit variable degrees of abnormal gut function, pinpointing, perhaps unexpectedly, the ENS as a diligent participant in idiopathic but also in inflammatory and cancerous diseases of the gut. In this review, we discuss the latest evidence on the role of the ENS in the pathogenesis of enteric neuropathies, disorders of gut-brain interaction, inflammatory bowel diseases, and colorectal cancer.",nocancer
"Remote communication in ENT has been expanding, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. Conferences and teaching have moved online, enabling easier participation, and reducing financial and environmental costs. Online multi-disciplinary meetings have recently been instigated in Africa to discuss management of cases in head and neck cancer, or cochlear implantation, expanding access and enhancing patient care. Remote patient consultation has also seen an explosion, but existing literature suggests some caution, particularly because many patients in ENT need an examination to enable definitive diagnosis. Ongoing experience will help us better understand how remote communication will fit into our future working lives, and also where face to face interaction may still be preferable.",nocancer
"Oscillatoxins (OTXs) and aplysiatoxins (ATXs) are biosynthetically related polyketides produced by marine cyanobacteria. We previously developed a synthetic route to phenolic O-methyl analogs of OTX-D and 30-methyl-OTX-D during collective synthesis of these natural products. According to our synthetic strategy, we achieved total synthesis of OTX-D, 30-methyl-OTX-D, OTX-E, and OTX-F by deprotecting the O-methyl group in an earlier intermediate, and determined their biological activities. Although OTX-D and 30-methyl-OTX-D have been reported to show anti-leukemic activity against L1210 cell line, we found that their cytotoxicity in vitro against this cell line is relatively weak (IC50: 29-52 muM). In contrast, OTX-F demonstrated cell line-selective anti-proliferative activity against DMS-114 lung cancer cells, which implies that OTXs target as yet unknown target molecules as part of this unique activity.",nocancer
"Purpose: Plasmonic photothermal cancer therapy by gold nanorods (GNRs) emerges as a promising tool for cancer treatment. The goal of this study was to design cationic oligoethylene glycol (OEG) compounds varying in hydrophobicity and molecular electrostatic potential as ligand shells of GNRs. Three series of ligands with different length of OEG chain (ethylene glycol units = 3, 4, 5) and variants of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) as terminal functional group were synthesized and compared to a prototypical quaternary ammonium ligand with alkyl chain - (16-mercaptohexadecyl)trimethylammonium bromide (MTAB). Methods: Step-by-step research approach starting with the preparation of compounds characterized by NMR and HRMS spectra, GNRs ligand exchange evaluation through characterization of cytotoxicity and GNRs cellular uptake was used. A method quantifying the reshaping of GNRs was applied to determine the effect of ligand structure on the heat transport from GNRs under fs-laser irradiation. Results: Fourteen out of 18 synthesized OEG compounds successfully stabilized GNRs in the water. The colloidal stability of prepared GNRs in the cell culture medium decreased with the number of OEG units. In contrast, the cellular uptake of OEG+GNRs by HeLa cells increased with the length of OEG chain while the structure of the QAS group showed a minor role. Compared to MTAB, more hydrophilic OEG compounds exhibited nearly two order of magnitude lower cytotoxicity in free state and provided efficient cellular uptake of GNRs close to the level of MTAB. Regarding photothermal properties, OEG compounds evoked the photothermal reshaping of GNRs at lower peak fluence (14.8 mJ/cm2) of femtosecond laser irradiation than the alkanethiol MTAB. Conclusion: OEG+GNRs appear to be optimal for clinical applications with systemic administration of NPs not-requiring irradiation at high laser intensity such as drug delivery and photothermal therapy inducing apoptosis.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: This study virtually compares patient-specific fibular and scapular reconstructions for maxillectomies. METHODS: Nine maxillectomy defects were created on 10 maxillas and virtually reconstructed with patient-specific fibulas and scapulas. Reconstructions were compared for restoring midface cephalometrics, dental implantability, and pedicle length. RESULTS: Of 90 maxillectomy defects, the vertically oriented scapula provided improved orbital floor and maxillary height reconstructions (p < 0.001), albeit at the cost of dental implantability compared to the fibula (p < 0.001). In two defects crossing the midline, the fibula, allowing for more osteotomies, provided improved maxillary projection. In the remaining three defects crossing the midline, the horizontally oriented scapula was comparable to the fibula. Fibular and scapular reconstructions were amenable for dental implantation and had similar pedicle lengths, although favoring scapula in extensive defects. CONCLUSION: Fibular and scapular reconstructions of maxillectomy defects provide unique strengths. This virtual analysis can guide a goal-oriented reconstruction based on defect type and patient-specific goals.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Age is considered as one of the most important risk-factor for many types of solid and hematological cancers, as their incidence increases with age in parallel to the ever-growing elderly population. Moreover, cancer incidence is constantly increasing as a consequence of the increase in life expectancy that favors the process of cellular senescence. Geriatric assessment has been increasingly recognized as predictive and prognostic instrument to detect frailty in older adults with cancer. In particular, the G8 score is a simple and reproducible instrument to identify elderly patients who should undergo full geriatric evaluation. Due to their frailty, elderly patients may be often under-treated and a therapeutic choice based also on a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is recommended. With these premises, we aim to test the impact of the CGA based interventions on the quality of life (QoL) of frail elderly onco-hematological patients, identified by the G8 screening, candidate for innovative target directed drugs or treatments including the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RT + CT). METHODS: Patients aged > 65 years, candidate to target directed agents or to RT + CT treatments are screened for frailty by the G8 test; those patients classified as frail (G8 <= 14) are randomized to receive a CGA at baseline or to conventional care. The primary endpoint is QoL, assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30C. As collateral biological study, the potential prognostic/predictive role of T-cell senescence and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are evaluated on plasma samples. DISCUSSION: This trial will contribute to define the impact of CGA on the management of frail elderly onco-hematologic patients candidate to innovative biological drugs or to integrated schedules with the association of RT + CT. Furthermore, the use of plasma samples to assess the potential prognostic value of imbalance of immune-competent cells is expected to contribute to the individualized care of elderly patients, resulting into a fine tuning of the therapeutic strategies.

"OBJECTIVES: Excessive use of sinus CT is a significant problem in medical imaging, resulting in unnecessary costs and radiation exposure. This study assesses frequency of sinus CT performed after recent head imaging has already adequately evaluated the sinuses. METHODS: A retrospective search of the PACS database of an academic medical center was performed to identify cases of sinus CT imaging in 2017. Cases were excluded if sinus CT was performed related to trauma, tumor, operative evaluation, or acute infection other than sinusitis (orbital cellulitis, intracranial abscess). Studies with separate imaging covering the sinuses ordered at the same time as sinus CT or performed previously within 4 weeks were identified and clinical information was recorded. RESULTS: Of 735 sinus CTs performed, 19 (5%) had same-day head imaging and 30 (8%) had previous head imaging within 4 weeks, adding up to a cumulative 13% of cases with recent head imaging. The average patient age was 42, with 13 pediatric cases. Of ordering providers, residents ordered the highest percentage of sinus CTs with same-day head imaging (84%) and previous imaging within 4 weeks (63%). The sinuses were described in all head CT radiology reports, while 10 of 12 brain MRI reports did not mention the sinuses. CONCLUSION: In one year, 13% of patients receiving sinus CTs at our institution had recent head imaging. A focused education effort for ordering providers to avoid repeating sinus imaging, and for radiology to comment on sinuses on head imaging, may reduce unnecessary sinus CTs.",nocancer
"For a long time, PLS3 (plastin 3, also known as T-plastin or fimbrin) has been considered a rather inconspicuous protein, involved in F-actin-binding and -bundling. However, in recent years, a plethora of discoveries have turned PLS3 into a highly interesting protein involved in many cellular processes, signaling pathways, and diseases. PLS3 is localized on the X-chromosome, but shows sex-specific, inter-individual and tissue-specific expression variability pointing towards skewed X-inactivation. PLS3 is expressed in all solid tissues but usually not in hematopoietic cells. When escaping X-inactivation, PLS3 triggers a plethora of different types of cancers. Elevated PLS3 levels are considered a prognostic biomarker for cancer and refractory response to therapies. When it is knocked out or mutated in humans and mice, it causes osteoporosis with bone fractures; it is the only protein involved in actin dynamics responsible for osteoporosis. Instead, when PLS3 is upregulated, it acts as a highly protective SMN-independent modifier in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Here, it seems to counteract reduced F-actin levels by restoring impaired endocytosis and disturbed calcium homeostasis caused by reduced SMN levels. In contrast, an upregulation of PLS3 on wild-type level might cause osteoarthritis. This emphasizes that the amount of PLS3 in our cells must be precisely balanced; both too much and too little can be detrimental. Actin-dynamics, regulated by PLS3 among others, are crucial in a lot of cellular processes including endocytosis, cell migration, axonal growth, neurotransmission, translation, and others. Also, PLS3 levels influence the infection with different bacteria, mycosis, and other pathogens.",nocancer
"Cellular genetic heterogeneity is common in many biological conditions including cancer, microbiome, and co-infection of multiple pathogens. Detecting and phasing minor variants play an instrumental role in deciphering cellular genetic heterogeneity, but they are still difficult tasks because of technological limitations. Recently, long-read sequencing technologies, including those by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, provide an opportunity to tackle these challenges. However, high error rates make it difficult to take full advantage of these technologies. To fill this gap, we introduce iGDA, an open-source tool that can accurately detect and phase minor single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), whose frequencies are as low as 0.2%, from raw long-read sequencing data. We also demonstrate that iGDA can accurately reconstruct haplotypes in closely related strains of the same species (divergence >=0.011%) from long-read metagenomic data.",nocancer

This article presents epidemiological and clinical aspects and guidelines for health service managers and health workers about diagnosing and treating people with papillomavirus infection. This theme is a significant public health issue since it is the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection globally, capable of triggering the oncogenic process of cervical cancer and the possibility of anogenital warts. Important information is presented for gaining knowledge about HPV and action strategies for infection prevention and control, provision of quality care, and effective treatment of the disease.

"Inflammation underlays the onset and supports the development of several worldwide diffused pathologies, therefore in the last decades inflammatory markers have attracted a great deal of interest as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Adhesion molecules are membrane proteins expressed by endotheliocytes and leukocytes, acting as mediators in the process of tethering, rolling, firm adhesion and diapedesis that leads the immune cells to reach an inflamed tissue. Among them, the adhesion molecule VCAM-1 has been investigated as a potential target because of its low constitutive expression and easy accessibility on the endothelium. Moreover, VCAM-1 is involved in the early stages of development of several pathologies like, among others, atherosclerosis, cancer, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, so a diagnostic or therapeutic tool directed to this protein would allow specific detection and efficacious intervention. The availability of monoclonal antibodies against VCAM-1 has recently fostered the development of various targeting technologies potentially suitable for imaging and drug delivery in VCAM-1 overexpressing pathologies. In this review we initially focus on the structure and functions of VCAM-1, giving also a brief overview of antibodies origin, structure and function; then, we summarize some of the VCAM-1 targeting nanosystems based on antibodies, gathered according to the carrier used, for diagnosis or therapeutic treatment of different inflammatory based pathologies.",nocancer
"Studies based on drug-DNA interactions, especially anticancer drug-DNA interactions, are of great importance for the method development. It is thought that single-use electrodes, which give fast, cheap and reproducible results, will make a great contribution to the chip technology for the development of individual patient analysis in the future. It is known that antioxidants reduce carcinogenesis caused by oxidative stress with their radical scavenging effects. Literature shows that quercetin (QRCT) exhibits anticancer activity by preventing oxidative cell damage as an effective radical scavenger. In this study, Bendamustine (BND), an anticancer drug, which is used in different blood cancer types, was electrochemically determined and the toxicity degree was calculated by examining the interaction of the drug with DNA in the absence and presence of QRCT, which is the first examination in the literature. Limit of detection and quantification for BND was calculated as 6.0 and 20.0 mug/mL respectively by using the equation I = 0.029 x CBND+ 1.197, (R2 = 0.997). We found that QRCT prevents the interaction between BND and DNA because of its strong interaction with DNA.",nocancer
"Chylous ascites is the leakage of lipid-rich lymph into the peritoneal cavity usually due to disruption of lymphatics or increased peritoneal lymphatic pressure. Various surgical options have been proposed to treat chylous ascites but most have shown suboptimal outcomes. The gastroepiploic vascularized lymph node (GE-VLN) flap has been described previously for the treatment of lymphedema. In chylous ascites, this flap could provide an alternate drainage pathway for the intraperitoneal chylous fluid. The purpose of this report is to present another option for the microsurgical treatment of refractory chylous ascites. Herein, we report two patients with refractory chylous ascites secondary to cancer who have undergone deep inferior epigastric-based lymphatic ""cable"" flap (DIE-LCF) connected to a pedicle GE-VLN flap. Patients were followed-up for a minimum of 2 years. Within the first 3 months following surgery, the patient's nutritional parameters improved along with drastic reduction of ascites. At 2 years follow-up postoperative abdominal circumference decreased significantly. None required further peritoneal paracentesis and all patients were free of chylous ascites symptoms. In conclusion, the DIE-LCF connected to a pedicle GE-VLN flap could be a feasible option for the microsurgical treatment of refractory chylous ascites.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Sulfhemoglobinemia is a rare dyshemoglobinemia that presents similarly to methemoglobinemia. CASE REPORT: An 83-year-old woman with stage IV ovarian cancer presented to the Emergency Department after a near syncopal spell and was found to be cyanotic with a pulse oximetry reading of 71%. Pulse oximetry improved to only the mid-80s range with administration of high-flow oxygen. Her arterial blood gas on supplemental high-flow oxygen demonstrated a PaO2 of 413 mm Hg and methemoglobin of 1.2%, but also noted the interference of the co-oximetry with sulfhemoglobinemia. Further history revealed that the patient had recently been started on phenazopyridine. The phenazopyridine was stopped, an exchange transfusion was offered but declined, and the patient was discharged to home hospice. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The diagnosis of sulfhemoglobinemia can be challenging given that routine co-oximetry does not identify it. The clue to the diagnosis is that the cyanotic-appearing patient has a normal or elevated PaO2 and seems to be less ill than expected, given the degree of cyanosis. Sulfhemoglobinemia does not reverse with the administration of methylene blue.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: MR is an important imaging modality for evaluating musculoskeletal malignancies owing to its high soft tissue contrast and its ability to acquire multiparametric information. PET provides quantitative molecular and physiologic information and is a critical tool in the diagnosis and staging of several malignancies. PET/MR, which can take advantage of its constituent modalities, is uniquely suited for evaluating skeletal metastases. We reviewed the current evidence of PET/MR in assessing for skeletal metastases and provided recommendations for its use. METHODS: We searched for the peer reviewed literature related to the usage of PET/MR in the settings of osseous metastases. In addition, expert opinions, practices, and protocols of major research institutions performing research on PET/MR of skeletal metastases were considered. RESULTS: Peer-reviewed published literature was included. Nuclear medicine and radiology experts, including those from 13 major PET/MR centers, shared the gained expertise on PET/MR use for evaluating skeletal metastases and contributed to a consensus expert opinion statement. [18F]-FDG and non [18F]-FDG PET/MR may provide key advantages over PET/CT in the evaluation for osseous metastases in several primary malignancies. CONCLUSION: PET/MR should be considered for staging of malignancies where there is a high likelihood of osseous metastatic disease based on the characteristics of the primary malignancy, hight clinical suspicious and in case, where the presence of osseous metastases will have an impact on patient management. Appropriate choice of tumor-specific radiopharmaceuticals, as well as stringent adherence to PET and MR protocols, should be employed.",nocancer
"The Endoscopy Computer Vision Challenge (EndoCV) is a crowd-sourcing initiative to address eminent problems in developing reliable computer aided detection and diagnosis endoscopy systems and suggest a pathway for clinical translation of technologies. Whilst endoscopy is a widely used diagnostic and treatment tool for hollow-organs, there are several core challenges often faced by endoscopists, mainly: 1) presence of multi-class artefacts that hinder their visual interpretation, and 2) difficulty in identifying subtle precancerous precursors and cancer abnormalities. Artefacts often affect the robustness of deep learning methods applied to the gastrointestinal tract organs as they can be confused with tissue of interest. EndoCV2020 challenges are designed to address research questions in these remits. In this paper, we present a summary of methods developed by the top 17 teams and provide an objective comparison of state-of-the-art methods and methods designed by the participants for two sub-challenges: i) artefact detection and segmentation (EAD2020), and ii) disease detection and segmentation (EDD2020). Multi-center, multi-organ, multi-class, and multi-modal clinical endoscopy datasets were compiled for both EAD2020 and EDD2020 sub-challenges. The out-of-sample generalization ability of detection algorithms was also evaluated. Whilst most teams focused on accuracy improvements, only a few methods hold credibility for clinical usability. The best performing teams provided solutions to tackle class imbalance, and variabilities in size, origin, modality and occurrences by exploring data augmentation, data fusion, and optimal class thresholding techniques.",nocancer
"With the advancement of nanochemistry, artificial nanozymes with high catalytic stability, low manufacturing and storage cost, and greater design flexibility over natural enzymes, have emerged as a next-generation nanomedicine.

"Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) plays an important role in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis. In this work, a dual-functional magnetic microsphere probe was designed for ICP-MS quantification and fluorescence imaging of MMP2 in cell secretion. In the designed probe, a NH2-peptide (-FAM)-biotin was used as a bridge for the combination of carboxylated magnetic beads (MBs-COOH) and streptavidin functionalized gold nanoparticle (Au NP-SA). Initially, the fluorescence of FAM was quenched by Au NP. Since the NH2-peptide (-FAM)-biotin had a MMP2-specifically recognized sequence, the peptide was specifically cleaved in the presence of MMP2, thus releasing Au NP for the ICP-MS quantification of MMP2 and turning on the fluorescence of FAM for the fluorescence imaging of MMP2. Under the optimal experimental conditions, a linear range of 0.05-50 ng mL-1 and a limit of detection of 0.02 ng mL-1 were obtained for MMP2. The relative standard deviation (n = 7, c = 0.1 ng mL-1) of the proposed method was 5.4%. With good sensitivity and good accuracy, the proposed method realized the quantification and imaging of MMP2 in A549 cell secretion. The proposed method was applied to monitor the expression of MMP2 in the A549 cell secretion under the stimulation of Cd2+, providing a new detection strategy in the study of MMP2-related life process.",nocancer
"Synovial chondromatosis of the finger is a rare metaplasia affecting either the finger joint or the tendon sheath. It is a benign extraosseus cartilage tumor that often occurs in numbers and is not solitary in nature. This accumulation of masses within the finger can lead the patient to seek medical care. Symptoms are often painful and functionally disabling. Although rare, synovial chondromatosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with multiple lesions or masses within the hand and finger. Patient workup involves advanced imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging, ultra-sonography, and computerized tomography. However, the results of these studies may be inconclusive. Conservative management can be discussed with the patient but has proven to be ineffective. Surgical excision is the recommended first-line treatment. Whether the surgery is arthroscopic or open, with or without synovectomy, is at the surgeon's discretion. Mass recurrence after surgery is an unfortunate complication, and subsequent treatment strategies are undefined. Recurrence may not occur at the same anatomical site. This condition can be intra-articular (within the figure joint) or extra-articular (within the tendon sheath or bursa). Revision surgery in the form of open excision with synovectomy is the mainstay of treatment. There have been only a few case reports of synovial chondromatosis involving the finger. This case series and up-to-date review of the literature presents a discussion of current surgical care. [Orthopedics. 2021;44(x):xx-xx.].",nocancer
"The interest in the introduction of the oxime group in molecules aiming to improve their biological effects is increasing. This work aimed to develop new steroidal oximes of the estrane series with potential antitumor interest. For this, several oximes were synthesized by reaction of hydroxylamine with the 17-ketone of estrone derivatives. Then, their cytotoxicity was evaluated in six cell lines. An estrogenicity assay, a cell cycle distribution analysis and a fluorescence microscopy study with Hoechst 3358 staining were performed with the most promising compound. In addition, molecular docking studies against estrogen receptor alpha, steroid sulfatase, 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 and beta-tubulin were also accomplished. The 2-nitroestrone oxime showed higher cytotoxicity than the parent compound on MCF-7 cancer cells. Furthermore, the oximes bearing halogen groups in A-ring evidenced selectivity for HepaRG cells. Remarkably, the Delta9,11-estrone oxime was the most cytotoxic and arrested LNCaP cells in the G2/M phase. Fluorescence microscopy studies showed the presence of condensed DNA typical of prophase and condensed and fragmented nuclei characteristic of apoptosis. However, this oxime promoted the proliferation of T47-D cells. Interestingly, molecular docking studies estimated a strong interaction between Delta9,11-estrone oxime and estrogen receptor alpha and beta-tubulin, which may account for the described effects.",nocancer
"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is an imprinting disorder characterized by prenatal and/or postnatal overgrowth, organomegaly, abdominal wall defects and tumor predisposition. CDKN1C is a maternally expressed gene of the 11p15.5 chromosomal region and is regulated by the imprinting control region IC2. It negatively controls cellular proliferation, and its expression or activity are frequently reduced in BWS. In particular, loss of IC2 methylation is associated with CDKN1C silencing in the majority of sporadic BWS cases, and maternally inherited loss-of-function variants of CDKN1C are the most frequent molecular defects of familial BWS. We have identified, using Sanger sequencing, novel CDKN1C variants in three families with recurrent cases of BWS, and a previously reported variant in a woman with recurrent miscarriages with exomphalos. Clinical evaluation of the patients showed variable manifestation of the disease. The frameshift and nonsense variants were consistently associated with exomphalos, while the missense variant caused a less severe phenotype. Pregnancy loss and perinatal lethality were found in the families segregating nonsense mutations. Intrafamilial variability of the clinical BWS features was observed, even between siblings. Our data are indicative of severe BWS phenotypes that, with variable expressivity, may be associated with both frameshift and nonsense variants of CDKN1C.",nocancer
"We investigate the effects of early-life exposure to war on adult health outcomes including cancer, hypertension, angina, infarction, diabetes and obesity. We combine data from the French prospective cohort study E3N on women employed in the French National Education with historical data on World War II. To identify causal effects, we exploit exogenous spatial and temporal variation in war exposure related to the German invasion of France during the Battle of France. The number of French military casualties at the level of the postcode area serves as main measure of exposure. Our results suggest that exposure to the war during the first 5 years of life has significant adverse effects on health in adulthood. A 10 percent increase in the number of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants in the individual's postcode area of birth increases the probability of suffering from any of the health conditions considered in this study by 0.08 percentage points. This is relative to a mean of 49 percent for the sample as a whole.",nocancer
"Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has been an active field of research motivated by the large number of highly lethal GI cancers. Early GI cancer precursors are often missed during the endoscopic surveillance. The high missed rate of such abnormalities during endoscopy is thus a critical bottleneck. Lack of attentiveness due to tiring procedures, and requirement of training are few contributing factors. An automatic GI disease classification system can help reduce such risks by flagging suspicious frames and lesions. GI endoscopy consists of several multi-organ surveillance, therefore, there is need to develop methods that can generalize to various endoscopic findings. In this realm, we present a comprehensive analysis of the Medico GI challenges: Medical Multimedia Task at MediaEval 2017, Medico Multimedia Task at MediaEval 2018, and BioMedia ACM MM Grand Challenge 2019. These challenges are initiative to set-up a benchmark for different computer vision methods applied to the multi-class endoscopic images and promote to build new approaches that could reliably be used in clinics. We report the performance of 21 participating teams over a period of three consecutive years and provide a detailed analysis of the methods used by the participants, highlighting the challenges and shortcomings of the current approaches and dissect their credibility for the use in clinical settings. Our analysis revealed that the participants achieved an improvement on maximum Mathew correlation coefficient (MCC) from 82.68% in 2017 to 93.98% in 2018 and 95.20% in 2019 challenges, and a significant increase in computational speed over consecutive years.",nocancer
"A novel series of tetracyclic imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives was designed and synthesized as potential antiproliferative agents. Their antiproliferative activity against human cancer cells was influenced by the introduction of chosen amino side chains on the different positions on the tetracyclic skeleton and particularly, by the position of N atom in the pyridine nuclei. Thus, the majority of compounds showed improved activity in comparison to standard drug etoposide. Several compounds showed pronounced cytostatic effect in the submicromolar range, especially on HCT116 and MCF-7 cancer cells. The obtained results have confirmed the significant impact of the position of N nitrogen in the pyridine ring on the enhancement of antiproliferative activity, especially for derivatives bearing amino side chains on position 2. Thus, regioisomers 6, 7 and 9 showed noticeable enhancement of activity in comparison to their counterparts 10, 11 and 13 with IC50 values in a nanomolar range of concentration (0.3-0.9 muM). Interactions with DNA (including G-quadruplex structure) and RNA were influenced by the position of amino side chains on the tetracyclic core of imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives and the ligand charge. Moderate to high binding affinities (logKs = 5-7) obtained for selected imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives suggest that DNA/RNA are potential cell targets.",nocancer
"Inflammation is associated with both lower and higher activity in brain regions that process rewarding stimuli. How can both low and high sensitivity to rewards be associated with higher inflammation? We propose that one potential mechanism underlying these apparently conflicting findings pertains to how people pursue goals in their environment. This prediction is based on evidence that both an inability to disengage from unattainable goals and low interest in and pursuit of important life goals are associated with poor health outcomes, including inflammation. Accordingly, this study examined the relationship between reward-related brain function and peripheral inflammation among individuals with different levels of ambitious goal-striving tendencies. Eighty-three participants completed an ambitious goal-striving tendency measure, an fMRI Monetary Incentive Delay task assessing orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) activation during reward anticipation and outcome, and a venous blood draw to assess the inflammatory biomarkers interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and C-reactive protein, from which we computed an inflammation composite score. We observed a reward anticipation by goal-striving interaction on inflammation, such that high OFC and NAc activation to reward anticipation (but not outcome) were associated with more inflammation, among high goal-striving individuals. By contrast, low NAc activation during reward anticipation (but not outcome) was associated with more inflammation, among low goal-striving individuals. The current study provides further evidence that both blunted and elevated reward function can be associated with inflammation. It also highlights the role that goal-striving tendencies may play in moderating the relationship between neural reward anticipation and inflammation.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: We verified the association between selected bacterial profiles and levels of cytokines, chemokines and the expression of signs and symptoms of primary endodontic infection with apical periodontitis (PEIAP). METHODS: Samples were collected from 21 root canals, and macrophages stimulated for 24 h. TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, INF-gamma, and CCL2 were measured using Cytometric Bead Array. We investigated the overlapping networks between cytokines and chemokine with regression analysis. Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization was used to assess 40 target bacteria species. Using factor analysis, bacterial species aggregated in two factors. The association of bacteria species-based factors on cytokine and chemokine levels and clinical features was estimated with regression analysis. RESULTS: A negative relationship between IL-10 (anti-inflammatory cytokine) and CCL2, TNF-alpha, as well as INF-gamma (pro-inflammatory cytokines) (all, P<.05) was observed. CCL2 was positively correlated with TNF-alpha (p<.01). Thirty-eight bacteria species were detected in PEIAP. The first bacteria species-based factor was associated with the size of radiolucent area (coef. 15.42) and tenderness to percussion/pain on palpation (coef. 20.79). The second factor was associated with CCL2 levels (coef. 1.28). CONCLUSION: Different bacterial profiles can be differentially related to the expression of inflammatory proteins and the experience of clinical features.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To analyze the influence of inflammatory parameters and substitute insulin resistance indices on the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) development in elderly women, as well as to compare anthropometric measures and metabolic parameters according to the presence of type 2 DM and HbA1c levels. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty elderly women (67.9 +- 6.0 years) were submitted to anthropometric analysis, determination of inflammatory and metabolic parameters. They also underwent indices of lipid accumulation product (LAP), high density triglyceride/lipoprotein ratio (TG/HDL), triglyceride glucose index (TyG), as well as TyG by body mass index (BMI) ratio (TyG-BMI) assessment. RESULTS: Body mass index, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-2, blood glucose, TG, LAP, TG/HDL, TyG and TyG-BMI were significantly higher in elderly women with DM compared to non-diabetic women. LAP >= 55.4 (OR = 2.29; P = .027); TyG >= 8.8 (OR = 3.52; P < .001) and TyG-BMI >= 264.8 (OR = 3.54; P = .001) were identified as risk factors for DM. CONCLUSION: High pro-inflammatory parameters, low levels of anti-inflammatory markers and higher levels of substitute insulin resistance indices are risk predictors for DM development in elderly women in primary health care.",nocancer
"About 11% of all human disease-associated gene lesions are nonsense mutations, resulting in the introduction of an in-frame premature translation-termination codon (PTC) into the protein-coding gene sequence. When translated, PTC-containing mRNAs originate truncated and often dysfunctional proteins that might be non-functional or have gain-of-function or dominant-negative effects. Therapeutic strategies aimed at suppressing PTCs to restore deficient protein function-the so-called nonsense suppression (or PTC readthrough) therapies-have the potential to provide a therapeutic benefit for many patients and in a broad range of genetic disorders, including cancer. These therapeutic approaches comprise the use of translational readthrough-inducing compounds that make the translational machinery recode an in-frame PTC into a sense codon. However, most of the mRNAs carrying a PTC can be rapidly degraded by the surveillance mechanism of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), thus decreasing the levels of PTC-containing mRNAs in the cell and their availability for PTC readthrough. Accordingly, the use of NMD inhibitors, or readthrough-compound potentiators, may enhance the efficiency of PTC suppression. Here, we review the mechanisms of PTC readthrough and their regulation, as well as the recent advances in the development of novel approaches for PTC suppression, and their role in personalized medicine.",nocancer
"Rapid urbanization and industrial development in the Langat Basin has disturbed the groundwater quality. The populations' reliance on groundwater sources may induce possible risks to human health such as cancer and endocrine dysfunction. This study aims to determine the groundwater quality of an urbanized basin through 24 studied hydrochemical parameters from 45 groundwater samples obtained from 15 different sampling stations by employing integrated multivariate analysis. The abundance of the major ions was in the following order: bicarbonate (HCO3-) > chloride (Cl-) > sodium (Na+) > sulphate (SO42-) > calcium (Ca2+) > potassium (K+) > magnesium (Mg2+). Heavy metal dominance was in the following order: Fe > Mn > Zn > As > Hg > Pb > Ni > Cu > Cd > Se > Sr. Classification of the groundwater facies indicated that the studied groundwater belongs to the Na-Cl with saline water type and Na-HCO3 with mix water type characteristics. The saline water type characteristics are derived from agricultural activities, while the mixed water types occur from water-rock interaction. Multivariate analysis performance suggests that industrial, agricultural, and weathering activities have contributed to groundwater contamination. The study will help in the understanding of the groundwater quality issue and serve as a reference for other basins with similar characteristics.",nocancer
"Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of proteins, nucleic acids, and biomolecules. It is a potential biomarker for diverse diseases such as breast cancer, osteopenia, and hepatobiliary. Herein, we developed a colorimetric sensor for the ALP assay based on its enzymatic activity to dephosphorylate the p-aminophenol phosphate (pAPP) into pAP. In a solution containing silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) and Ag+ ions prepared using a low concentration of NaBH4, pAP mediates the growth of AgNPs by reducing the concentration of Ag+ ions to enhance the intensity of localized surface plasmon resonance as the pAPP cannot induce a reduction of the remaining Ag+ due to the masking of the hydroxyl with phosphate. The quantitative assay of the ALP was demonstrated via the colorimetric detection of the pAP-mediated growth of AgNPs in the presence of an ALP. The highly sensitive enzymatic growth of AgNPs provided a wider dynamic linear range of 0.5-225 U/L with a lower limit of detection of 0.24 U/L than that previously reported. The use of pAP resulted in excellent selectivity of the sensor for the ALP assay in human serum, yielding a high recovery rate and a high precision of 99.2 +- 1.5 % for the standard addition method.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: RA is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent joint inflammation. Extra-articular manifestations of RA can involve different organs including the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Using a large database, we sought to describe the epidemiology of pancreas involvement in RA. METHODS: We queried a multicentre database (Explorys Inc, Cleveland, OH, USA), an aggregate of electronic health record data from 26 major integrated US healthcare systems in the US from 1999 to 2019. After excluding patients younger than 18, a cohort of individuals with Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED-CT) diagnosis of RA was identified. Within this cohort, patients who developed a SNOMED-CT diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP), chronic pancreatitis (CP) and primary pancreatic cancer (PaCa) after at least 30 days of RA diagnosis were identified. Statistical analysis for multivariate model was performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 25, IBM Corp) to adjust for several factors. RESULTS: Of the 56 183 720 individuals in the database, 518 280 patients had a diagnosis of RA (0.92%). Using a multivariate regression model, patients with RA were more likely to develop AP [odds ratio (OR): 2.51; 95% CI: 2.41, 2.60], CP (OR: 2.97; 95% CI: 2.70, 3.26) and PaC (OR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.52, 2.10). CONCLUSION: In this large database, we found a modest increased risk of AP and CP among patients with RA after adjusting for the common causes of pancreatitis. Further studies are required to better understand this association and the effect of medications used for RA.",nocancer

"Next-generation sequencing has transformed our knowledge of the genetics of lymphoid malignancies. However, limited experimental systems are available to model the functional effects of these genetic changes and their implications for therapy. The majority of mature B-cell malignancies arise from the germinal center (GC) stage of B-cell differentiation. Here we describe a detailed protocol for the purification and ex vivo expansion of primary, nonmalignant human GC B cells. We present methodology for the high-efficiency transduction of these cells to enable combinatorial expression of putative oncogenes. We also describe alternative approaches for CRISPR-Cas9-mediated deletion of putative tumor suppressors. Mimicking genetic changes commonly found in lymphoid malignancies leads to immortalized growth in vitro, while engraftment into immunodeficient mice generates genetically customized, synthetic models of human lymphoma. The protocol is simple and inexpensive and can be implemented in any laboratory with access to standard cell culture and animal facilities. It can be easily scaled up to enable high-throughput screening and thus provides a versatile platform for the functional interrogation of lymphoma genomic data.",nocancer
"Infection by human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) occurs in lymphocytes, which travel throughout the body, thus affecting several target organs and causing varied clinical outcomes, particularly in populations that are underserved and do not have access to healthcare. However, the mechanism of pathogenesis is not yet fully understood. The TAX and HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) proteins maintain viral persistence and affect pathogenesis through cell proliferation and immune and inflammatory responses that accompany each clinical manifestation. TAX expression leads to inhibition of transcription error control, OX40 overexpression, and cell proliferation in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). OX40 levels are elevated in the central nervous system (CNS), and the expression of TAX in the CNS causes neuronal damage and loss of immune reactivity among patients with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (HAM). HBZ reduces viral replication and suppresses the immune response. Its cell compartmentalization has been associated with the pathogenesis of HAM (cytoplasmic localization) and ATL (nuclear localization). TAX and HBZ seem to act antagonistically in immune responses, affecting the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection. The progression from HTLV-1 infection to disease is a consequence of HTLV-1 replication in CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes and the imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The compartmentalization of HBZ suggests that this protein may be an additional tool for assessing immune and inflammatory responses, in addition to those already recognized as potential biomarkers associated with progression from infection to disease (including human leukocyte antigen (HLA), killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-28, Fas, Fas ligand, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and mannose-binding lectin).",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often accompanied by pulmonary infection, inflammatory responses, decreased immunity, and decreased lung function. The relationships among the pulmonary inflammation index (PII), lung function, and immunity in COPD patients with pulmonary infection remain unclear. METHODS: This retrospective observational study enrolled 234 participants (patients with COPD and pulmonary infection, patients with COPD without pulmonary infection, and healthy individuals) from January 2017 to December 2019. RESULTS: Levels of interleukin (IL)-6 were lower and levels of IL-8 were higher in patients with COPD and pulmonary infection. Levels of white blood cells (WBCs), C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and CD8+ cells were higher, while levels of CD3+ and CD4+ cells, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1 % predicted (FEV1%pred), and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) (FEV1%FVC) were lower in patients with COPD and pulmonary infection. Levels of WBCs, CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha were negatively associated with FEV1, FEV1%pred and FEV1%FVC. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COPD and pulmonary infection have high PIIs, decreased immunity, and poor lung function. PII is closely related to lung function and may represent a useful biomarker for the assessment of patients with COPD and pulmonary infection.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: This study compared treatment persistence and adherence among psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients in the US who initiated an interleukin-12/23 inhibitor (IL-12/23i) versus those who initiated tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis), targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (tsDMARDs), or interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17is). METHODS: Adults diagnosed with PsA with >= 1 claim for a targeted immune modulator were selected from the IBM MarketScan  Commercial and Medicare Supplemental databases (October 1, 2013-October 31, 2018). The date of the first claim was the index date. Patients had continuous health plan enrollment for >= 12 months pre-index and >= 12-month post-index period. Pairwise propensity score matching with nearest-neighbor technique was performed. Persistence duration, discontinuation rate, and the proportion of days covered (PDC) were evaluated in biologic/tsDMARD naive patients who initiated TNFis, IL-17is, tsDMARDs, or IL-12/23i (reference group). RESULTS: There were 238 matched patient pairs for TNFi versus IL-12/23i, 238 pairs for tsDMARD versus IL-12/23i, and 189 pairs for IL-17is versus IL-12/23i. Duration of persistence was longer for the IL-12/23i cohort than for the TNFi (269 vs. 215 days, p < 0.001) or tsDMARD (269 vs. 213 days, p < 0.001) cohorts, but comparable between the IL-12/23i and IL-17i cohorts (267 vs. 246 days, p = 0.199). Fewer patients in the IL-12/23i cohort discontinued their index medication than in the TNFi (53.4% vs. 73.9%, p < 0.001) or tsDMARD (53.4% vs. 71.8%, p < 0.001) cohorts, but no significant difference was observed between the IL-12/23i and IL-17i cohorts (52.9% vs. 58.2%, p = 0.288). During the 12-month follow-up, adherence (i.e., PDC) was higher among those who initiated an IL-12/23i than among those who initiated TNFis (0.64 vs. 0.56, p = 0.004) or tsDMARDs (0.64 vs. 0.58, p = 0.027), but similar to those who initiated IL-17is (0.64 vs. 0.65, p = 0.589). CONCLUSION: In this real-world study of PsA therapies with differing mechanisms of action, the IL-12/23i demonstrated longer persistence and higher adherence than either TNFis or tsDMARDs, and comparability to IL-17is.",nocancer
"The advent of drug-eluting stents (DES) has revolutionised the treatment of coronary artery disease. These devices, coated with anti-proliferative drugs, are deployed into stenosed or occluded vessels, compressing the plaque to restore natural blood flow, whilst simultaneously combating the evolution of restenotic tissue. Since the development of the first stent, extensive research has investigated how further advancements in stent technology can improve patient outcome. Mathematical and computational modelling has featured heavily, with models focussing on structural mechanics, computational fluid dynamics, drug elution kinetics and subsequent binding within the arterial wall; often considered separately. Smooth Muscle Cell (SMC) proliferation and neointimal growth are key features of the healing process following stent deployment. However, models which depict the action of drug on these processes are lacking. In this article, we start by reviewing current models of cell growth, which predominantly emanate from cancer research, and available published data on SMC proliferation, before presenting a series of mathematical models of varying complexity to detail the action of drug on SMC growth in vitro. Our results highlight that, at least for Sodium Salicylate and Paclitaxel, the current state-of-the-art nonlinear saturable binding model is incapable of capturing the proliferative response of SMCs across a range of drug doses and exposure times. Our findings potentially have important implications on the interpretation of current computational models and their future use to optimise and control drug release from DES and drug-coated balloons.",nocancer

An altered actin cytoskeleton is a structural hallmark associated with numerous pathologies ranging from cardiovascular diseases to immune disorders, neurological diseases and cancer. The actin cytoskeleton in cells is regulated through the orchestrated actions of a myriad of actin-binding proteins.

"Efficient therapies are available for the treatment of osteoporosis. Anti-resorptive therapies, including bisphosphonates and denosumab increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce the risk of fractures by 20-70%. Bone-forming or dual-action treatments stimulate bone formation and increase BMD more than the anti-resorptive therapies. Two studies have demonstrated that these treatments are superior to anti-resorptives in preventing fractures in patients with severe osteoporosis. Bone-forming or dual-action treatments should be followed by anti-resorptive treatment to maintain the fracture risk reduction. The BMD gains seen with bone-forming and dual-action treatments are greater in treatment naive patients compared to patients pretreated with anti-resorptive treatments, however, the antifracture efficacy seems to be preserved. Treatment failure will often lead to switch of treatment from orally to parentally administrated anti-resorptives treatment or from anti-resorptive to bone-forming or dual-action treatment. Osteoporosis is a chronic condition and therefore needs a long-term management plan with a personalized approach to treatment.",nocancer
"Underground shopping districts (USDs) are susceptible to severe indoor air pollution, which can adversely impact human health. We measured 24 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 13 USDs throughout South Korea from July to October 2017, and the human risk of inhaling hazardous substances was evaluated. The sum of the concentrations of the 24 VOCs was much higher inside the USDs than in the open air. Based on factor analysis, six indoor air pollution sources were identified. Despite the expectation of a partial outdoor effect, the impacts of the indoor emissions were significant, resulting in an indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratio of 5.9 and indicating elevated indoor air pollution. However, the effects of indoor emissions decreased, and the contributions of the pollution sources reduced when the USD entrances were open and the stores were closed. Although benzene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde exhibited lower concentrations compared to previous studies, they still posed health risks in both indoor and outdoor settings. Particularly, while the indoor excess cancer risk (ECR) of formaldehyde was ~10 times higher than its outdoor ECR, benzene had a low I/O ratio (1.1) and a similar ECR value. Therefore, indoor VOC concentrations could be reduced by managing inputs of open air into USDs.",nocancer
"Natural peptides extracted from natural components such are known to have a relatively short in-vivo half-life and can readily metabolize by endo- and exo-peptidases. Fortunately, synthetic peptides can be easily manipulated to increase in-vivo stability, membrane permeability and target specificity with some well-known natural families. Many natural as well as synthetic peptides target to their endogenous receptors for diagnosis and therapeutic applications. In order to detect these peptides externally, they must be modified with radionuclides compatible with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). Although, these techniques mainly rely on physiological changes and have profound diagnostic strength over anatomical modalities such as MRI and CT. However, both SPECT and PET observed to possess lack of anatomical reference frame which is a key weakness of these techniques, and unfortunately, cannot be available freely in most clinical centres especially in under-developing countries. Hence, it is need of the time to design and develop economic, patient friendly and versatile strategies to grapple with existing problems without any hazardous side effects. Optical molecular imaging (OMI) has emerged as a novel technique in field of medical science using fluorescent probes as imaging modality and has ability to couple with organic drugs, small molecules, chemotherapeutics, DNA, RNA, anticancer peptide and protein without adding chelators as necessary for radionuclides.

"Selenium (Se) is an essential element for the maintenance of a healthy physiological state. However, due to environmental and dietary factors and the narrow safety range of Se, diseases caused by Se deficiency or excess have gained considerable traction in recent years. In particular, links have been identified between low Se status, cognitive decline, immune disorders, and increased mortality, whereas excess Se increases metabolic risk. Considerable evidence has suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate interactions between the environment (including the diet) and genes, and play important roles in several diseases, including cancer. MiRNAs target messenger RNAs to induce changes in proteins including selenoprotein expression, ultimately generating disease. While a plethora of data exists on the epigenetic regulation of other dietary factors, nutrient Se epigenetics and especially miRNA regulated mechanisms remain unclear. Thus, this review mainly focuses on Se metabolism, pathogenic mechanisms, and miRNAs as key regulatory factors in Se-related diseases. Finally, we attempt to clarify the regulatory mechanisms underpinning Se, miRNAs, selenoproteins, and Se-related diseases.",nocancer
"Methotrexate (MTX) is a promising chemotherapeutic agent. Its medical use is limited by induced nephropathy. Our study was designed to explore the reno-protective effect of diallyl disulfide (DADS), an organosulfur compound of garlic oil, on MTX-induced nephropathy. Adult rats were randomly divided into 4 groups; normal control, DADS (50 mg kg-1  day-1 , p.o.), MTX (20 mg/kg, i.p.) and DADS+MTX. DADS significantly decreased serum creatinine, urea, uric acid, and albumin levels with an improvement of final body weight. Additionally, DADS markedly attenuated MTX-induced elevations in renal MDA and NO 2 -  contents with an increase in GSH content and SOD activity. Mechanistically, DADS effectively down-regulated mRNA expression level of renal p38 and NF-kappaB. Additionally, DADS positively regulated the NRF2 gene with a remarkable inhibition of Keap-1 gene. Furthermore, DADS up-regulated BCL2 protein and remarkably suppressed the expression of both BAX and caspase-3 proteins. Overall, DADS has favorable renal protection against MTX-induced nephropathy via modulation of Keap-1/NRF2, p38/NF-kappaB, and BCL2/BAX/caspase-3 signaling. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Diallyl disulfide is one of the organosulfur compounds of garlic oil. Our study demonstrated that DADS substantially alleviated the decline of kidney function and renal injury induced by MTX. The antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties may constitute an important part of its therapeutic applications via regulation of p38/NF-kappaB, Keap-1/NRF2, and BCL2/BAX/caspase-3 signaling pathways. Therefore, DADS could be a potential therapeutic adjunct in cancer chemotherapy to decrease the associated side effects of MTX.

"BACKGROUND: SIRT1 plays a protective role against diabetic retinopathy as it regulates inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy of cells. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the effects of arbutin and to identify a potential mechanism of action. Adult human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells were exposed to high glucose (HG) or treated with different concentrations of arbutin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The protein levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, like tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1beta), IL-6, and p65 were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of NF-kappaB p65 and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was detected with western blot assay. Cell apoptosis was analyzed with TUNEL assay, and expression levels of Bcl2, BAX, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, LC3II, LC3I, and beclin1 were detected with western blot assay. Autophagy levels were detected using LC3II immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: Arbutin treatment markedly enhanced viability and autophagy mediators, decreased pro-inflammatory proteins and reduced apoptosis in ARPE cells under HG exposure, while increasing SIRT1 protein level. This could be blocked by Sirtinol treatment. Additionally, 3MA treatment significantly reduced the efficacy of arbutin against inflammatory markers and apoptosis in ARPE cells exposed to HG. CONCLUSIONS: Arbutin suppressed inflammation and apoptosis of ARPE cells induced by HG by promoting autophagy via SIRT1. A potential target, SIRT1, was identified for the treatment of DR, and new effects of and action mechanisms for arbutin were found and confirmed.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: Frontal sinus osteomyelitis is a severe complication which can result from chronic rhinosinusitis, trauma, or as a complication of reconstruction or obliteration of the frontal sinus. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the contemporary management of frontal sinus osteomyelitis in light of recent advancements in endoscopic surgical techniques. METHODS: Review of a prospectively collected database of patients with frontal sinus pathology was performed from 2008-2020. Data from individuals with frontal sinus osteomyelitis was collected including demographics, etiology, surgical technique, adjunctive medical treatments, complications, and clinical follow up. RESULTS: Sixteen patients (average age 48.3, range 8-84) were included in the study. An open approach was utilized in 6 patients (2 osteoplastic flaps, 3 Reidel procedures, 1 cranialization). Seven patients underwent completely endoscopic approaches (3 Draf IIB, 4 Draf III), while 3 individuals had combined procedures (Lynch with Draf III, osteoplastic flap + Draf III, fistula excision + Draf IIb). All patients received 6 weeks of antibiotics. Average clinical follow up was 24.4 months with no patients requiring revision procedures. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic, endoscopic-assisted, and open approaches were utilized successfully in the current series of patients with osteomyelitis of the anterior table of the frontal sinus. While the progression of endoscopic techniques allows an additional surgical treatment option, it is important to select patients appropriately as open procedures continue to have an important role in the treatment algorithm.",nocancer
"Keloid is a benign tumor characterized by persistent inflammation, increased fibroblast proliferation, and abnormal deposition of collagen in the wound. The etiology of keloid is unclear. Here, we explored the phospho-signaling changes in human keloid fibroblasts via phosphoproteome mass spectrometry analysis. We found that comparative phosphoproteomics could statistically distinguish keloid from control fibroblasts. Differentially expressed phosphoproteins could predict the activation of known keloid-relevant upstream regulators including transforming growth factor-beta1, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-5. With multiple bioinformatics analyses, phosphorylated FLNA, TLN1, and VCL were significantly enriched in terms of calcium homeostasis and platelet aggregation. We biologically verified that keloid fibroblasts had a higher level of Ca2+ influx than the control fibroblasts upon ionomycin stimulation. Via co-cultivation analysis, we found that human keloid fibroblasts could directly promote platelet aggregation. As suggested by PhosphoPath and gene set enrichment analysis, pFLNA was centered as the top phosphoproteins associated with keloid phenotypes. We validated that pFLNA was upregulated both in keloid fibroblasts and keloid tissue section, implicating its biomarker potential. In conclusion, we reported the first phosphoproteome on keloid fibroblasts, based on which we revealed that keloid fibroblasts had aberrant calcium homeostasis and could directly induce platelet aggregation.",nocancer
"AIM: To study cytokine profiles and intra-individual correlations in crevicular fluid samples at periodontitis, peri-implantitis, and healthy sites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples from gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) were collected from healthy and diseased sites in patients who had had dental implants for a minimum of 10 years. Cytokine levels were analyzed using the Bio-Plex Pro Human inflammation kit, which included biomarkers for the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) superfamily, regulatory T Cell (Treg) cytokines, and interferon (IFN) proteins. RESULTS: GCF/PICF cytokine levels, determined in samples from 163 patients, were frequently lower for healthy tooth and implant sites compared to sites with periodontitis or peri-implantitis. In contrast, there were no significant differences in cytokine levels between peri-implant sites and periodontitis sites. Intra-individual correlations between cytokines at peri-implant sites were frequently significant. In addition, the cytokines IFN-lambda1 and TNFSF12 were significantly correlated with the presence of peri-implantitis. CONCLUSION: Within the limits of this study, the intra-individual cytokine profile did not differ between sites diagnosed with periodontitis and those diagnosed with peri-implantitis, but did differ between healthy tooth and healthy implant sites. Studying intra-individual cytokine profiles is a method to elucidate possible differences between the etiopathogeneses of periodontitis and peri-implantitis, since it is well known that immune responses to dysbiosis vary between individuals according to host factors. Thus, the findings of the present study are potentially relevant to the advancement of knowledge in this field.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Radiomics has been applied to breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for gene status prediction. However, the features of peritumoral regions were not thoroughly investigated. PURPOSE: To evaluate the use of intratumoral and peritumoral regions from functional parametric maps based on breast dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) for prediction of HER-2 and Ki-67 status. STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. POPULATION: A total of 351 female patients (average age, 51 years) with pathologically confirmed breast cancer were assigned to the training (n = 243) and validation (n = 108) cohorts. FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T, T1 gradient echo. ASSESSMENT: Radiomic features were extracted from intratumoral and peritumoral regions on six functional parametric maps calculated using time-intensity curves of DCE-MRI. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to determine the reproducibility of feature extraction. Based on the intratumoral, peritumoral, and combined intra- and peritumoral regions, three radiomics signatures (RSs) were built using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression model, respectively. STATISTICAL TESTS: Wilcoxon rank-sum test, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, LASSO, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, and DeLong test. RESULTS: The intratumoral and peritumoral RSs for prediction of HER-2 and Ki-67 status achieved areas under the ROC (AUCs) of 0.683 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.574-0.793) and 0.690 (95% CI, 0.577-0.804), and 0.714 (95% CI, 0.616-0.812) and 0.692 (95% CI, 0.590-0.794) in the validation cohort, respectively.

Transnasal swallowing endoscopy allows to evaluate sufficiently dysphagia with limited risks. With this method therapy options can be judged for effectiveness. There are other additional radiologic assessments to complete diagnostic. Swallowing therapy should be initiated as first-line approach for hypersalivation and offers several treatment concepts to overcome the syndrome. Glycopyrrolate bromid received approval for children and adolescents as it reduces saliva flow relevantly with limited risk. Other anticholinergic drugs are restricted in use because of their side effects and off-label-use situation. Ultrasound guided injections of botulinum toxine in salivary glands are an established treatment option since decades. Meanwhile, the evidence for this method has improved, so Incobotulinum toxine is an approved therapy for chronic hypersalivation in adults, whereby new injections are needed about every four months. In the light of effective medical options, surgical approaches such as salivary duct relocation are recommended less often today because of invasiveness and failure. Radiotherapy is reserved mainly for neurodegenerative diseases and shows good response, but the cancer induction risks need to be discussed. A close follow-up regime is necessary to establish compliance not only by the patient, but also by his family and caregivers. By this, treatment effects can be optimized and therapies can be adjusted individually.",nocancer
"Trovafloxacin (TVX) is associated with idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury (iDILI) and inflammation-mediated hepatotoxicity. However, the inflammatory stress-regulated mechanisms in iDILI remain unclear. Herein, we elucidated the novel role of tumor-necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), an inflammatory stress factor, in TVX-induced in vitro hepatotoxicity and synergistic toxicity. TVX specifically induced synergistic toxicity in HepG2 cells with TNFalpha, which inhibits autophagy. TVX-treated HepG2 cells induced protective autophagy by inhibiting the expression of mTOR signaling proteins, while ATG5 knockdown in HepG2 cells, responsible for the impairment of autophagy, enhanced TVX-induced toxicity due to the increase in cytochrome C release and JNK pathway activation. Interestingly, the expression of mTOR signal proteins, which were suppressed by TVX, disrupted the negative feedback of the PI3K/AKT pathway and TNFalpha rebounded p70S6K phosphorylation. Co-treatment with TVX and TNFalpha inhibited protective autophagy by maintaining p70S6K activity, which enhanced TVX-induced cytotoxicity. Phosphorylation of p70S6K was inhibited by siRNA knockdown and rapamycin to restore TNFalpha-inhibited autophagy, which prevented the synergistic effect on TVX-induced cytotoxicity. These results indicate that TVX activates protective autophagy in HepG2 cells exposed to toxicity and an imbalance in negative feedback regulation of autophagy by TNFalpha synergistically enhanced the toxicity. The finding from this study may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying iDILI associated with inflammatory stress.",nocancer
"Arsenic, a group 1 carcinogen for humans, is abundant as compared to other trace elements in the environment and is present mainly in the Earth's crust and soil. The arsenic distributions in different geographical regions are dependent on their geological histories. Anthropogenic activities also contribute significantly to arsenic release into the environment. Arsenic presents several complications to humans, animals, and plants. The physiology of plants and their growth and development are affected by arsenic. Arsenic is known to cause cancer and several types of organ toxicity, such as cardiotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and hepatotoxicity. In the environment, arsenic exists in variable forms both as inorganic and organic species. From arsenic containing compartments, plants can absorb and accumulate arsenic. Crops grown on these contaminated soils pose several-fold higher toxicity to humans compared with drinking water if arsenic enters the food chain. Information regarding arsenic transfer at different trophic levels in food chains has not been summarized until now. The present review focuses on the food chain perspective of arsenic, which affects all components of the food chain during its course. The circumstances that facilitate arsenic accumulation in flora and fauna, as components of the food chain, are outlined in this review.",nocancer
"Acetone is one of the toxic, explosive, and harmful gases. It may cause several health hazard issues such as narcosis, headache, etc. Acetone is also regarded as a key biomarker gas to diagnose several diseases as well as monitor the disorders in human health. Based on clinical findings, acetone concentration in human breath is correlated with many diseases such as asthma, halitosis, lung cancer, and diabetes. Thus, its investigation can become a new approach for health monitoring. Better management in the early stages of such diseases has the potential not to reduce deaths associated with the disease but also reduce medical costs. ZnO-based sensors show great potential for acetone gas due to its high chemical stability, simple synthesis process, and low cost. Findings suggested that the acetone sensing performance of such sensors can be significantly improved by manipulating microstructure (surface area, porosity, etc.), composition, and morphology of ZnO nanomaterials. This article provides a comprehensive review of the-state-of-the-art research activities, published during last five years (2016 to 2020), related to acetone gas sensing using ZnO. It focuses on different types of nanostructured ZnO-based acetone gas sensors. Proper engineering of ZnO structural properties has to lead to the detection of acetone at 5 ppb level with excellent selectivity and reproducibility at an operating temperature of 150 0 C.",nocancer
"The COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts on population health not only through COVID-positive cases, but also via the disruption of healthcare services, which in turn has impacted the diagnosis and treatment of all other diseases during this time. We study changes in all new registered diagnoses in ICD-10 groups during 2020 with respect to a 2019 baseline. We compare new diagnoses in 2019 and 2020 based on administrative records of the public primary health system in Central Catalonia, Spain, which cover over 400,000 patients and 3 million patient visits. We study the ratio of new diagnoses between 2019 and 2020 and find an average decline of 31.1% in new diagnoses, with substantial drops in April (61.1%), May (55.6%), and November (52%). Neoplasms experience the largest decline (49.7%), with heterogeneity in the magnitudes of the declines across different types of cancer diagnoses. While we find evidence of temporal variation in new diagnoses, reductions in diagnoses early in the year are not recouped by the year end. The observed decline in new diagnoses across all diagnosis groups suggest a large number of untreated and undetected cases across conditions. Our findings provide a year-end summary of the impact of the pandemic on healthcare activities and can help guide health authorities to design evidence-based plans to target under-diagnosed conditions in 2021.",nocancer
"Automatic breast lesion segmentation in ultrasound helps to diagnose breast cancer, which is one of the dreadful diseases that affect women globally. Segmenting breast regions accurately from ultrasound image is a challenging task due to the inherent speckle artifacts, blurry breast lesion boundaries, and inhomogeneous intensity distributions inside the breast lesion regions. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in medical image segmentation tasks. However, the convolutional operations in a CNN often focus on local regions, which suffer from limited capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies of the input ultrasound image, resulting in degraded breast lesion segmentation accuracy. In this paper, we develop a deep convolutional neural network equipped with a global guidance block (GGB) and breast lesion boundary detection (BD) modules for boosting the breast ultrasound lesion segmentation. The GGB utilizes the multi-layer integrated feature map as a guidance information to learn the long-range non-local dependencies from both spatial and channel domains. The BD modules learn additional breast lesion boundary map to enhance the boundary quality of a segmentation result refinement. Experimental results on a public dataset and a collected dataset show that our network outperforms other medical image segmentation methods and the recent semantic segmentation methods on breast ultrasound lesion segmentation. Moreover, we also show the application of our network on the ultrasound prostate segmentation, in which our method better identifies prostate regions than state-of-the-art networks.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is a condition that needs timely diagnosis and treatment. It has insignificant clinical features and presents high risk of misdiagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate NCSE among patients with stroke, given that stroke plays an important role in the etiology of NCSE. METHODS: In this retrospective study, acute stroke patients who were admitted and followed up at a stroke outpatient clinic between January 2013 and March 2016 were included. Patients with previous histories of epilepsy, brain tumor, head trauma, hypertensive encephalopathy, arteriovenous malformation, subarachnoid hemorrhage or cerebral venous thrombosis were excluded. Demographic properties, stroke etiology, imaging method, EEG findings, stroke severity according to the NIHSS score, functional disability and modified Rankin Scale were recorded for all patients. RESULTS: Thirty-nine out of 792 stoke patients experienced NCSE. The mean age of the study population was 70+-1.2 years (min-max: 46-90). The study population was composed of 28 females (71.8%) and 11 males (28.2%). NCSE had early onset in 23 patients (59%) and late onset in 16 (41%). The early-onset NCSE patients were older and this was statistically significant between the groups (early onset: 73.5+-11.5; late onset: 65.9+-12.1; p=0.04). A history of previous stroke was more frequent in the late-onset NCSE group (14; 87,5%) than in the early-onset group (11; 47.8%) (p=0.01). The prognosis was worse in the early-onset group, but without statistical significance. CONCLUSION: Changes in mental status in the early stages of stroke are mostly attributed to stroke itself, but NCSE should be suspected in the right clinical setting, such as in older patients with suspicious anatomical and clinical associations.",nocancer
"Glucose is the main circulating energy substrate for the adult brain. Owing to the high energy demand of nerve cells, glucose is actively oxidized to produce ATP and has a synergistic effect with mitochondria in metabolic pathways. The dysfunction of glucose metabolism inevitably disturbs the normal functioning of neurons, which is widely observed in neurodegenerative disease. Understanding the mechanisms of metabolic adaptation during disease progression has become a major focus of research, and interventions in these processes may relieve the neurons from degenerative stress. In this review, we highlight evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction, decreased glucose uptake, and diminished glucose metabolism in different neurodegeneration models such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD). We also discuss how hypoxia, a metabolic reprogramming strategy linked to glucose metabolism in tumor cells and normal brain cells, and summarize the evidence for hypoxia as a putative therapy for general neurodegenerative disease.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Surgery results in systemic inflammation, which can affect the central nervous system, leading to changes in mood, emotion, and behavior. Our previous study has shown that compared to midazolam, dexmedetomidine premedication effectively decreased children's postoperative anxiety. AIM: To investigate whether dexmedetomidine infusion before hernia repair alleviates postoperative systemic inflammation in children and whether postoperative anxiety may be associated with postoperative inflammation. METHODS: This prospective double-blind randomized-controlled trial was conducted in 120 children scheduled to undergo elective hernia repair. Before anesthesia induction, all children received an intravenous infusion consisted of dexmedetomidine (n = 40; 0.5 microg/g, group D), midazolam (n = 40; 0.08 mg/kg, group M), or normal saline (n = 40; group C). One-way ANOVA with least significant difference multiple comparison test was used for multigroup comparisons of postoperative plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines and m-YPAS scores. Spearman rank correlation tests were used for analyzing m-YPAS scores with postoperative plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines. RESULTS: Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (7.0 +- 1.6 vs. 8.1 +- 1.6, mean difference [95% CI]: 1.19[0.26-2.11], P = 0.008) (pg/ml) and of interleukin-6 (1.8 +- 1.2 vs. 3.3 +- 1.6, mean difference [95% CI]: 1.49[0.74-2.25], P < 0.001) (pg/ml) and neutrophils-to-lymphocyte ratio (1.0 +- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +- 0.7, mean difference [95% CI]: 0.48[0.17-0.78], P < 0.001) were significantly lower in group D than in group C. Furthermore, compared to group M, group D showed significantly lower plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha levels(7.0 +- 1.6 vs. 7.9 +- 1.9, mean difference [95% CI]: 0.96[0.04-1.88], P = 0.04) (pg/ml) and interleukin-6 levels(1.8 +- 1.2 vs. 2.9 +- 1.5, mean difference [95% CI]: 1.06[0.31-1.81], P = 0.004) (pg/ml) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (1.0 +- 0.5 vs. 1.5 +- 0.6, mean difference [95% CI]:0.42 [0.11-0.72], P = 0.004). Anxiety scores at postoperative 2 and 4 h in the three groups positively correlated with plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines.

"Studies have reported that miR-195-5p plays a role in the Hirschsprung disease (HSCR). Our previous work found GDNF family receptor alpha 4 (GFRA4) is also associated with HSCR. In this study, we focused on whether miR-195-5p induces the absence of enteric neurons and enteric neural crest in HSCR by regulating GFRA4. The expression levels of GFRA4 and miR-195-5p in colon tissues were evaluated by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assay. We overexpressed GFRA4 or miR-195-5p in SH-SY5Y cells, the cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and invasion were subsequently investigated by CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, Flow cytometry analysis and Transwell assay, respectively. We also established the xenograft model to detect the effect of miR-195-5p on tumor growth and GFRA4 and p-RET expressions. GFRA4 expression was significantly downregulated in the HSCR colon tissues when compared with that in the control tissues. Overexpression of GFRA4 significantly promoted proliferation, invasion and cell cycle arrest, and inhibited apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. We also proved that GFRA4 is a direct target of miR-195-5p, and miR-195-5p inhibited proliferation, invasion, cell cycle arrest and differentiation, and accelerated apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells which can be reversed by GFRA4 overexpression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-195-5p suppressed tumor growth, and observably decreased GFRA4 and p-RET expressions. Our findings suggest that miR-195-5p plays an important role in the pathogenesis of HSCR. MiR-195-5p inhibited proliferation, invasion and cell cycle arrest, and accelerated apoptosis of nerve cells by targeting GFRA4.",nocancer
"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development. However, the function and mechanism of circRNA pituitary tumor-transforming 1 interacting protein (circ- PTTG1IP) in RA are unknown. The expression of circ-PTTG1IP in synovial tissues of RA patients and fibroblast-like synoviocytes from RA patients (RA-FLSs) were detected by RT-qPCR. The results uncovered that circ-PTTG1IP was overexpressed in RA patients and RA-FLSs, and circ-PTTG1IP knockdown suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and inflammatory response in RA-FLSs. Besides, we found that circ-PTTG1IP could directly bind to miR-671-5p, and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was a target of miR-671-5p, which was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter assay. miR-671-5p inhibitor attenuated the effects of circ-PTTG1IP knockdown on RA-FLSs, while the effects of miR-671-5p mimic on RA-FLSs were partly reversed by TLR4 overexpression. Furthermore, circ-PTTG1IP could upregulate TLR4 expression by miR-671-5p. Thus, circ-PTTG1IP knockdown repressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and inflammatory response in RA-FLSs by regulating the miR-671-5p/TLR4 axis.",nocancer
"Ustekinumab (STELARA ), a human monoclonal antibody directed against IL-12 and IL-23, is FDA-approved to treat psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. Increasing recognition of paradoxical skin reactions induced by older biologic therapies used for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), such as adalimumab and infliximab, has led to the investigation of ustekinumab for the treatment of the cutaneous and gastrointestinal manifestations of IBD. In addition, ustekinumab may show efficacy in treating paradoxical cutaneous reactions to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors. A search of the Medline/PubMed database, with additional citations obtained from the references section of relevant articles, yielded 22 articles that were included in this review. Ustekinumab is a safe and effective option for treating the cutaneous manifestations of IBD, such as metastatic Crohn's disease and pyoderma gangrenosum. It is also an effective treatment for TNF-alpha inhibitor-induced paradoxical skin reactions such as psoriasis that do not remit spontaneously or with conventional treatment. Additional studies should focus on the optimal dosing of ustekinumab for dermatologic conditions beyond psoriasis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",nocancer
"Polylactide (PLA) is among the most common biodegradable polymers, with applications in various fields, such as renewable and biomedical industries. PLA features poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) and poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) enantiomers, which form stereocomplex crystals through racemic blending. PLA emerged as a promising material owing to its sustainable, eco-friendly, and fully biodegradable properties. Nevertheless, PLA still has a low applicability for drug delivery as a carrier and scaffold. Stereocomplex PLA (sc-PLA) exhibits substantially improved mechanical and physical strength compared to the homopolymer, overcoming these limitations. Recently, numerous studies have reported the use of sc-PLA as a drug carrier through encapsulation of various drugs, proteins, and secondary molecules by various processes including micelle formation, self-assembly, emulsion, and inkjet printing. However, concerns such as low loading capacity, weak stability of hydrophilic contents, and non-sustainable release behavior remain. This review focuses on various strategies to overcome the current challenges of sc-PLA in drug delivery systems and biomedical applications in three critical fields, namely anti-cancer therapy, tissue engineering, and anti-microbial activity. Furthermore, the excellent potential of sc-PLA as a next-generation polymeric material is discussed.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Previous studies identified factors influencing regulatory approval to introduction timelines for individual vaccines. However, introduction and uptake timelines have not been comprehensively assessed across the portfolio of Gavi-supported vaccines. METHODS: We analysed median times between introduction milestones from vaccine licensure to country introduction and uptake across six vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs), three delivery platforms and 69 Gavi-supported countries. Data were gathered from public, partner and manufacturer records. VPDs and prequalified vaccines analysed included Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTwP-HepB-Hib, pentavalent), pneumococcal disease (pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV), rotavirus diarrhoea (rotavirus vaccine, RVV), cervical cancer (human papillomavirus vaccine, HPV), polio (inactivated polio vaccine, IPV) and meningococcal meningitis (meningococcal group A conjugate vaccine, MenA). RESULTS: Median time from first vaccine licensure to first Gavi-supported country introduction across VPDs at a 'global level' (Gavi-supported countries) was 5.4 years. Once licensed, MenA vaccines reached first introduction fastest (campaign=0.6 years; routine immunisation (RI)=1.7 years). Most introductions were delayed. Country uptake following first introduction was accelerated for more recently Gavi-supported RI vaccines compared with older ones. CONCLUSION: Factors accelerating timelines across delivery platforms included rapid product prequalifications by WHO, strong initial recommendations by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization, achieving target product profiles on first vaccine licensure within a VPD and completing several VPD milestones at a global level prior to licensure. Milestones required for introduction in Gavi-supported countries should start prior or in parallel to licensure to accelerate uptake of vaccines delivered through diverse delivery platforms.",nocancer
"Melanocyte-specific CD8+ T cells enrichment correlates with the severity of vitiligo, and the role of A20 derived from myeloid cells in the enrichment of pathogenic T cells is unknown. Premelanosome (PMEL)-specific transgenic CD8+ T cells were adoptive transferred into Krt14- Kitl* mice to construct the vitiligo model, which was further mated with A20MKO mice and IKK2fl/fl mice. Bone marrow cells were stimulated with 30% L929 cell-conditioned medium, Fc-human tumor necrosis factor, and lipopolysaccharides to induce bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). The relative expression of CCL2, CCL5, and IL12A was detected with real-time PCR, and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) related molecules were detected with Western blots. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was utilized to assay the percent of innate and adaptive immune cells in the spleen and bone marrow, and CD45+ T in the skin. Down-regulated A20 was detected in the skin biopsies of vitiligo patients. A20 deficiency did not affect the development of T cells, B cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. A20 negatively regulated the induction of proinflammatory chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, and IL12A) and NFkappaB related molecule expression in BMDMs, which could be blocked by NFkappaB knockout. It further revealed that A20 negatively regulated the onset of vitiligo in mice with diminished CD45+ cells enrichment, which could also be reversed by NFkappaB knockout. A20 deficiency in myeloid cells could deteriorate the onset of vitiligo in mice, and A20 can be considered as a treatment target. This article is protected by copyright.

"Coronavirus disease in 2019 emerged in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. After a month, it was declared a global threat to public health. The effects of the pandemic could be socio-economic, undermining the health system and risking livelihoods. Vulnerability to this infection has been associated with underlying comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, cancer, and compromised immune systems. Co-morbidity has been common to the elderly, the disabled, and the homeless. In addition, more severe coronavirus disease outcomes have been reported in older males than females. Nonetheless, multiple variables are related to the concept of cultural gender that should be taken into account as women in more affected sectors are economically disadvantageous and over-represented. Similarly, although children are not the face of this pandemic, calamity has a profound effect on their welfare, especially for those living in poor and inconvenient situations. Moreover, the economic influence could be profound and universal when viewed through a migration lens as it is exacerbating xenophobic and discriminatory treatment. Protection measures to mitigate the outbreak of a pandemic, such as social distancing, may reduce social support for certain categories relied on for their day-to-day activities. The mental health of people would definitely be affected by the additional psychosocial burden of the pandemic, particularly in vulnerable groups. Integrated approaches are therefore mandatory to assist these groups and contain the pandemic.",nocancer
"RATIONALE: A growing body of literature has identified a robust relationship between the experience of racial discrimination and negative self-reported physical and mental health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The current study seeks to identify which factors -at the community level- predict racial disparities in actual disease manifestation. This study focuses on the extent to which regional demographics and racial attitudes, both implicit and explicit, are associated with prevalence rates of several diseases for Black and White patients in the United States. METHODS: Implicit and explicit racial attitudes obtained from Project Implicit (Xu et al., 2017) were aggregated at the county level to predict variation in the prevalence rates of several chronic illnesses among Medicare recipients. RESULTS: When controlling for economic indicators, Black and White patients who live in areas with high implicit and explicit racial bias tend to exhibit a higher incidence of chronic health problems, including cancer, stroke, asthma, diabetes, and heart failure. These relationships tended to be stronger for Black patients. Additionally, patients in racially diverse and racially segregated regions also tended to exhibit a higher incidence of chronic health problems. CONCLUSION: Findings from the study highlight the reliable relationship between both racial biases and regional demographics and the incidence rates of several chronic diseases, particularly in Black patients.",nocancer
"Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) is a key component of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor signaling complex that regulates both pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling. The reciprocal functions of RIPK1 in TNF signaling are determined by the state of the posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of RIPK1. However, the underlying mechanisms associated with the PTMs of RIPK1 are unclear. In this study, we found that RING finger protein 4 (RNF4), a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase, is required for the RIPK1 autophosphorylation and subsequent cell death. It has been reported that RNF4 negatively regulates TNF-alpha-induced activation of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) through downregulation of transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) activity, indicating the possibility that RNF4-mediated TAK1 suppression results in enhanced sensitivity to cell death. However, interestingly, RNF4 was needed to induce RIPK1-mediated cell death even in the absence of TAK1, suggesting that RNF4 can promote RIPK1-mediated cell death without suppressing the TAK1 activity. Thus, these observations reveal the existence of a novel mechanism whereby RNF4 promotes the autophosphorylation of RIPK1, which provides a novel insight into the molecular basis for the PTMs of RIPK1.",nocancer
"Anti-TNF therapeutics bind and sequester tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to prevent downstream signaling and are clinically important in the treatment of several autoimmune diseases. Effective treatment with these drugs requires frequent therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). Current analytical methods, including reporter gene assay (RGA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and mobility shift assay (MSA), can be technically rigorous, slow, and expensive. These qualities prevent the implementation of point-of-care testing and ultimately limit the frequency and utility of monitoring. An assay simple enough to be performed in the clinic would enable increased TDM frequency, more accurate dosing, and improved patient outcomes. Toward this end, we developed a homogeneous immunoassay based on a tri-part split-luciferase system for ""add-and-read"" detection of anti-TNF therapeutics. In our platform, two small fragments of the split-luciferase, called beta9 and beta10, are each fused to a different interacting protein. The binding of each of these proteins to anti-TNF antibodies forces the split-luciferase components into proximity where they reform the active luciferase. We identified the fusion proteins, beta9-protein A (beta9-A) and beta10-TNF, as promising binding pairs. We systematically adjusted assay conditions to optimize the signal/background (S/B) ratio, limit of detection (LOD), and percent recovery. The assay has a large dynamic range (0.5-32 mug/mL) and is sensitive enough to monitor both subtherapeutic and supratherapeutic serum concentrations of anti-TNF antibodies, as demonstrated in clinical samples.",nocancer
"It is imperative to control radio-iodine discharges to atmosphere from nuclear reprocessing plants. Inhalation and ingestion of radio-iodine cause its concentration in the thyroid gland leading to risk of thyroid cancer in humans. Two isotopes of iodine viz. iodine-131 (131I) and iodine-129 (129I) are generated in considerable quantities in the nuclear fuel as fission products in the nuclear reactors. From nuclear reactors, no iodine is released to the atmosphere during normal operations, whereas from spent fuel reprocessing plants, during normal operation, iodine is discharged to the atmosphere, mainly through gaseous discharges. Shortly after the initial periods of reprocessing in 1944, iodine emission control methods were incorporated in the design of reprocessing plants. At the time of spent fuel discharge from reactor, quantity of 131I is high and can contribute radiation dose to humans during reprocessing operations. A delay or cooling period of spent fuel, before reprocessing for a definite number of days can reduce the quantities to below the permissible limits of discharge due to its short half-life of 8 days. 129I has a very long half-life, and is only significant for reprocessing plants of large throughput and high fuel burn-ups. Minimum required de-contamination factor (DF) for iodine for a reprocessing plant can be estimated from the limits of discharge of iodine stipulated by regulatory authority of each country. Though many processes were developed and demonstrated extensively in lab and pilot scale, only a few of these processes were found to be suitable for commercial deployment. This paper reviews systematically the operation experiences and performance characteristics of iodine control methods implemented so far. The review also focus on the effect of integrating various iodine control methods on the main reprocessing operations and thereby facilitate selection of the optimum iodine control method.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is an emerging technique that has drawn attention in the field of cancer treatment. IRE uses non-thermal electric pulses to induce death of cancerous cells. However, recent studies have shown that the application of this technique may result in heating of the tissue. There is still room for improving its efficiency and defining better treatment protocols. This study investigates the optimal IRE protocols that avoiding the thermal damage during the IRE treatment. METHODS: Electrode and pulse parameter are investigated. Finite element models are created to evaluate the ablation area and the temperature changes in the tissue. The model is validated experimentally in bovine liver tissue, while the parameters were optimized using response surface method (RSM). RESULTS: From analysis of variance, the parameter of electrode distance and input voltage has significant effect to the temperature rise in the IRE treatment of bovine liver (P = 0.020 and P = 0.003 respectively). Meanwhile, only the input voltage significantly affects the ablation area (P < 0.001). The optimal result from RSM showed that for maximum ablation area 250.82mm2 with no thermal damage, the IRE protocol consisted of an active electrode length of 10 mm, a distance between electrodes of 10 mm, and the delivery of 50 pulses of 41.21 micros and 3000 V. CONCLUSIONS: The approach presented in this study allows the optimization of the IRE protocols. An optimal IRE protocol that maximizes the ablation area was successfully calculated which can be applied with no risk of thermal damage to the tissue.",nocancer
"The syntheses of bis(triazolium)carbazole precursors and their corresponding coinage metal (Au, Ag) complexes are reported. For alkylated triazolium salts, di- or tetranuclear complexes with bridging ligands were isolated, while the bis(aryl) analogue afforded a bis(carbene) Au I -CNC pincer complex suitable for oxidation to the redox-stable [Au III (CNC)Cl] + cation. Although the ligand salt and the [Au III (CNC)Cl] + complex were both notably cytotoxic toward the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231, the Au III complex was somewhat more selective. Electrophoresis, viscometry, UV-vis, CD and LD spectros-copy suggest the cytotoxic [Au III (CNC)Cl] + complex behaves as a partial DNA intercalator. In silico screening indicated that the [Au III (CNC)Cl] + complex can target DNA three-way junctions with good specificity, several other regular B -DNA forms, and Z -DNA. Multiple hydrophobic pi-type interactions involving T and A bases appear to be important for B -form DNA binding, while phosphate O   Au interactions evidently underpin Z -DNA binding. The CNC ligand effectively stabilizes the Au III ion, preventing reduction in the presence of glutathione. Both the redox stability and DNA affinity of the hit compound might be key factors underpinning its cytotoxicity in vitro .",nocancer
"Improvements in the laser-scribed graphene (LSG)-based electrodes are critical to overcoming limitations of bare LSG electrodes in terms of sensitivity, direct immobilization of detection probes for biosensor fabrication, and ease of integration with point-of-care (POC) devices.

"INTRODUCTION: Antiresorptive-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (ARONJ) is a rare but serious adverse event associated with bone-modifying agents (BMAs) and affects patients in the terminal stages of cancer. Molecular targeting drugs (MTDs), anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) drugs are essential in various cancer treatments, although MTDs are risk factors for ARONJ. However, the mechanism through which MTDs affect treatment prognosis of ARONJ remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the potential inhibitory factors for healing in the conservative therapy of ARONJ with a focus on MTDs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty patients who were administered BMAs for the treatment of malignancies and who underwent conservative treatment for ARONJ were assessed. The healing rate of ARONJ for each risk factor was retrospectively evaluated. RESULTS: Among the 60 patients, 27 were male and 33 were female. The median age was 67 years, and the median follow-up period was 292 (range 91-1758) days. The healing rate was lower in those treated with both zoledronic acid (Za) and denosumab (Dmab) than in those treated with Za or Dmab alone (0% vs. 28.8%, p = 0.03). Regarding the administration of MTDs, the treatment rate with anti-VEGFR drugs was 7.1% (p = 0.04), anti-EGFR drugs was 12.5% (p = 0.18), and without MTDs was 36.8%. CONCLUSION: In the conservative treatment of ARONJ, the administration of several BMAs and anti-VEGFR drugs was the factor contributing to the inhibition of healing.",nocancer
"IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic fibroinflammatory disease characterised by dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration rich in IgG4-positive plasma cells, storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis. Serum IgG4 levels are typically elevated but half of the patients had normal serum IgG4 levels. IgG4-RD represents a spectrum of diseases that involve various organs such as the pancreas, liver, kidneys, and salivary glands often manifesting as diffuse organ enlargement or a mass-like lesion mimicking cancer. An increased incidence of malignancy among patients with IgG4-RD has been reported. Thus, differentiating malignancy from IgG4-RD manifestation is important as the treatment differs. Glucocorticoids are considered first-line therapy and should be started early to prevent fibrosis. Patients usually have an excellent clinical response to steroids, and poor steroid response is indicative of an alternative diagnoses such as malignancy. This case report describes a case of IgG4-RD with renal mass in a young man that resolved with glucocorticoid therapy alone.",nocancer
" Adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency (OMIM #615688) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a wide clinical spectrum, including small- and medium-sized vessel vasculopathies, but data focusing on the associated neuroimaging features are still scarce in the literature. Here, we describe the clinical neuroimaging features of 12 patients with genetically proven adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency (6 males; median age at disease onset, 1.3 years; median age at genetic diagnosis, 15.5 years). Our findings expand the neuroimaging phenotype of this condition demonstrating, in addition to multiple, recurrent brain lacunar ischemic and/or hemorrhagic strokes, spinal infarcts, and intracranial aneurysms, also cerebral microbleeds and a peculiar, likely inflammatory, perivascular tissue in the basal and peripontine cisterns. Together with early clinical onset, positive family history, inflammatory flares and systemic abnormalities, these findings should raise the suspicion of adenosine deaminase 2 deficiency, thus prompting genetic evaluation and institution of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, with a potential great impact on neurologic outcome.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Intussusception has a low incidence rate in adults. Many cases in adults are caused by tumors. Intussusception results from conditions other than tumors are uncommon. This is the first case report about intussusception that occurred after removing a long intestinal tube (LT). CASE PRESENTATION: A 69-year-old female complained of ""recurrent abdominal pain with reduced flatus passage and frequency of bowel movement for 10 days"" was admitted to the hospital. Plain abdominal radiography and abdominal CT upon admission showed intestinal obstruction. The patient's abdominal pain was not relieved after symptomatic treatments, which involved fluid and electrolyte replacement, LT placement, spasmolytic agents, and analgesics. Hence, surgical exploration was carried out. The patient had a good recovery postoperatively. No abdominal pain or bloating developed after food intake. The patient passed flatus and had bowel movements later. On postoperative day 9, the LT was removed. On the 10th day, the patient suddenly developed abdominal distension and acute abdominal pain. Emergency abdominal CT showed small bowel intussusception. Surgical exploration was then performed. Severe small bowel dilatation located at 1.5 m from the ligament of Treitz was found during the procedure. Intussusception at the site was observed. No color change of the intestinal wall was detected, suggesting that no necrosis was present. So, a manual reduction was done. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 6. CONCLUSIONS: This case serves as a warning that the simple action of pulling out the LT might also cause serious complications, which should be given more attention.",nocancer
"Providing care for transplant recipients is challenging given the need to maintain optimal graft function and survival, while managing the debilitating side effects and complications associated with immunosuppression including infection, cancer, new-onset diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.Given the complexity of treatment options and the uncertainty about long term benefits and harms of treatment, understanding patient preferences and values are key to ensuring that clinical decisions take into consideration patient priorities to support shared decision-making and self-management. Choice experiments are increasingly used to quantify patient and community preferences, including in the field of transplantation. Discrete choice experiments (DCE) are a well-established, validated methodology used to elicit preferences for decision-making in health and other settings. In transplantation for example, DCEs have been used to elicit patient preferences for outcomes following kidney transplantation, to identify community preferences factors for organ allocation and in establishing core outcomes. This article provides an overview of the concepts and methods used in the design of DCEs and how patients' preferences can be applied in shared decision-making in transplantation.",nocancer
"The innate and adaptive immune systems play an essential role in host defense against pathogens. Various signal transduction pathways monitor and balance the immune system since an imbalance may promote pathological states such as allergy, inflammation, and cancer. Mast cells have a central role in the regulation of the innate/adaptive immune system and are involved in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and allergic diseases by releasing inflammatory mediators such as histamines, proteases, chemotactic factors, and cytokines. Although various signaling pathways are associated with mast cell activation, our discovery and characterization of the pLysRS-Ap4A signaling pathway in these cells provided an additional important step towards a full understanding of the intracellular mechanisms involved in mast cell activation. In the present review, we will discuss in depth this signaling pathway's contribution to host defense and the pathological state.",nocancer
"Bacterial DNA containing unmethylated CpG motifs can activate immune cells to release proinflammatory cytokines. Here, the role of bacterial DNA containing CpG motifs in diseases with a focus on arthritis is discussed. Our studies demonstrate that the intraarticular injection of bacterial DNA and oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG motifs (CpG ODN) induced arthritis. The induction of arthritis involves the role of macrophages over other cells such as neutrophils, NK cells, and lymphocytes. TNF-alpha and TNFRI play an important role in the development of arthritis. NF-kappaB also plays a critical regulatory role in arthritis. Systemic anti-inflammatory treatment, along with antibiotic therapy, has beneficial effects on the course and the outcome of bacterial arthritis. Thus, future treatment strategies for bacterial arthritis should include attempts to minimizing bacterial growth while blocking the proinflammatory effects of the bacterial DNA. Significant therapeutic efficiency has also been shown by CpG ODN-mediated Th1 immune activation in mouse models of cancer, infectious disease, and allergy/asthma.",nocancer
"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in multiple biological processes and can be used as biomarkers for clinical disease diagnosis, so their detection is of great importance. Here, manganese dioxide (MnO2) nanosheet acts as carrier to deliver DNAzyme probes into cells through endocytosis, where intracellular glutathione (GSH) reduces the MnO2 nanosheet to manganese ions (Mn2+) and releases the probes. The generated Mn2+ can be further used as an effective cofactor to activate the DNAzyme probe, and cleave the DNA strand into two fragments. Then, the miRNA-155 in the cells can hybridize with the cleaved fragment to cause the fluorescence signal change of the probe. The proposed proportional fluorescent method has been applied to the imaging of miRNA-155 in HeLa cells and HepG2 cells with the estimated detection limit (LOD) as 1.6 x 10-12 M. The new method can provide great help for cancer diagnosis and biological research related to miRNA.",nocancer
"The adoptive transfer of T cells that are engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) has shown remarkable success in treating B cell malignancies but only limited efficacy against other cancer types, especially solid tumours. Compared with haematological diseases, solid tumours present a unique set of challenges, including a lack of robustly expressed, tumour-exclusive antigen targets as well as highly immunosuppressive and metabolically challenging tumour microenvironments that limit treatment safety and efficacy. Here, we review protein- and cell-engineering strategies that seek to overcome these obstacles and produce next-generation T cells with enhanced tumour specificity and sustained effector function for the treatment of solid malignancies.",nocancer
"The 20S proteasome enzyme complex is involved in the proteolytic degradation of misfolded and oxidatively damaged proteins and is a focus of medical research for the development of compounds with pharmaceutical properties, which are active in cancer cells and/or neurodegenerative diseases. The present study aims to develop a biosensor for investigating the 20S proteasome activity and inhibition by means of electrochemical methods. The 20S proteasome is best immobilized at the electrode surface through bio-affinity interactions with antibodies that target different subunits on the 20S proteasome, enabling the investigation of the effect of an enzyme's orientation on biosensor response. The enzymatic activity is analyzed by fixed potential amperometry with the highest sensitivity of 24 muA cm-2 mM-1 and a LOD of 0.4 muM. The detection principle involves the oxidation of an electroactive probe that is released from the enzyme's substrates upon proteolysis. The most sensitive biosensor is then used to study the multicatalytic activity of the 20S proteasome, i.e. the caspase-, trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activity, by analyzing the biosensor's sensitivity towards different substrates. The behavior of the immobilized 20S proteasome is investigated as a function of substrate concentration. The kinetic parameters are derived and compared with those obtained when the enzyme was free in solution, with K0.5 values being one to two orders of magnitude lower in the present case. Two 20S inhibitors, epoxomicin and bortezomib, are investigated by analyzing their influence on the 20S biosensor response. The proposed analytical method for proteasome activity and inhibitor screening has the main advantage of being cost-effective compared to the ones typically employed.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Papua New Guinea, Pacific Island nations, and Timor-Leste represent a range of island nations with populations ranging from a few thousand to 8 million. They perform on average about 25% of the Lancet Commission of Global Surgery's target 5000 per 100 000 population and their health workforce have significant deficits of trained surgeons and anaesthetists. This study was conducted to determine how the current national health plans of these nations have included surgery and anaesthesia. METHODS: The most recent (as of December 2018) published national health plans of 10 Pacific Island nations (Cook Islands, Fiji, Nauru, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu), Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste were reviewed for content and process, searching for key words and identifying themes related to surgery and anaesthesia. RESULTS: There were 12 national health plans with a combined total of 478 pages. There was limited surgical and/or anaesthesia input within the planning process. Injuries, blindness, cancer and non-communicable diseases were included themes, but the potential role of surgical care in addressing these conditions was not well documented. The need for better information and registries was noted by several nations but possible surgical care delivery or outcome metrics were not included. CONCLUSION: There is limited mention of surgical and anaesthesia care planning within current health plans in the Pacific, PNG and TL. There is a need for greater surgical and anaesthesia engagement in future plans with performance measured against World Health Organization core surgical indicators.",nocancer
"Juglone (Jug) is one of the main active substances of Cortex Juglandis Mandshuricae in a folk anti-cancer prescription. Previously, there were few studies on its interaction with DNA and mechanism of action. The present paper studied, the mechanism of action between Jug and calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) by fluorescence spectroscopy, together with ethidium bromide (EB) fluorescence probe, UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, salt effect and ctDNA melting point (Tm) experiment, resonance scattering spectroscopy and molecular docking under the simulated human physiological conditions. The experimental findings indicated that Jug quiescently quenched the fluorescence of EB-ctDNA system, characteristic absorption peak intensity of ctDNA presented a decolorization effect after the interaction of ctDNA and Jug, the interaction with ctDNA enhanced of Jug resonance scattering peak and generated new resonance scattering peak, the salt exerted less effect on the interaction between Jug and ctDNA molecules, and the interaction with Jug increased the Tm value of ctDNA by 5.0  C The binding constant (KA) between Jug and ctDNA was 2.12 x 105 L/mol (310 K) and the number of binding sites (n) was about 1. The interaction between Jug and ctDNA was an entropically driven spontaneous and endothermic process. The results of molecular docking further showed that the naphthoquinone plane was embedded in the region between the two TA bases in the ctDNA groove, and the 5'-hydroxyl and 4-naphthoquinone groups extended to the outside of the ctDNA double helix.",nocancer
"Nine previously proposed segmentation evaluation metrics, targeting medical relevance, accounting for holes, and added regions or differentiating over- and under-segmentation, were compared with 24 traditional metrics to identify those which better capture the requirements for clinical segmentation evaluation. Evaluation was first performed using 2D synthetic shapes to highlight features and pitfalls of the metrics with known ground truths (GTs) and machine segmentations (MSs). Clinical evaluation was then performed using publicly-available prostate images of 20 subjects with MSs generated by 3 different deep learning networks (DenseVNet, HighRes3DNet, and ScaleNet) and GTs drawn by 2 readers. The same readers also performed the 2D visual assessment of the MSs using a dual negative-positive grading of -5 to 5 to reflect over- and under-estimation. Nine metrics that correlated well with visual assessment were selected for further evaluation using 3 different network ranking methods - based on a single metric, normalizing the metric using 2 GTs, and ranking the network based on a metric then averaging, including leave-one-out evaluation. These metrics yielded consistent ranking with HighRes3DNet ranked first then DenseVNet and ScaleNet using all ranking methods. Relative volume difference yielded the best positivity-agreement and correlation with dual visual assessment, and thus is better for providing over- and under-estimation. Interclass Correlation yielded the strongest correlation with the absolute visual assessment (0-5). Symmetric-boundary dice consistently yielded good discrimination of the networks for all three ranking methods with relatively small variations within network. Good rank discrimination may be an additional metric feature required for better network performance evaluation.",nocancer
"A major emphasis in precision medicine is to optimally treat subgroups of patients who may benefit from certain therapeutic agents. And as such, enormous resources and innovative clinical trials designs in oncology are devoted to identifying predictive biomarkers. Predictive biomarkers are ones that will identify patients that are more likely to respond to specific therapies and they are usually discovered through retrospective analysis from large randomized phase II or phase III trials. One important design to consider is the stratified biomarker design, where patients will have their specimens obtained at baseline and the biomarker status will be assessed prior to random assignment. Regardless of their biomarker status, patients will be randomized to either an experimental arm or the standard of care arm. The stratified biomarker design can be used to test for a treatment-biomarker interaction in predicting a time-to event outcome. Many biomarkers, however, are derived from tissues from patients, and their levels may be heterogeneous. As a result, biomarker levels may be measured with error and this would have an adverse impact on the power of a stratified biomarker clinical trial. We present a trial design and an analysis framework for the stratified biomarker design. We show that the naive test is biased and provide bias-corrected estimators for computing the sample size and the 95% confidence interval when testing for a treatment-biomarker interaction in predicting a time to event outcome. We propose a sample size formula that adjusts for misclassification and apply it in the design of a phase III clinical trial in renal cancer.",nocancer
"HIV is a pandemic and continuously raises problem across the world. This disease puts an immense pressure on treatment modalities. There are only few clinically accepted drugs available for the treatment and few molecules under clinical development. Although, the antiretroviral drugs give reliable and positive response on control of virus replication but during the long treatment, it has been affirmed that there are number of side effects. With recent advancements in biotechnology, nanomaterials such as gold and silver etc. are proving to be a game changer in targeted drug delivery treatment. As gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are biocompatible natural excipients, a lot of scientists are very eager to investigate more about the immune effects of AuNPs to create a safe and cost effective treatment that could potentially help in the reduction of numerous toxic effects present in the existing treatments of various critical diseases like cancer and HIV etc. In this context, the present hypothesis recommends the use of combination drug delivery strategy based on gold nanoparticles that could pave the way to overcome adverse results of existing delivery techniques of antiretroviral drugs to treat HIV. This review also highlights the fact that a proper development of this gold nanoparticle combination antiretroviral drug delivery approach will not only help to suppress the virus multiplication but also target the viral entry area by attaching with gp120 (glycoprotein 120), and inhibit the binding with CD4 (Cluster of differentiation 4) T cells.",nocancer
"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to have antitumor effect in different tumors, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Autophagy plays a critical role in tumorigenesis and cancer therapy and has been found to be activated by ATO in different cells. However, the role of autophagy in the antitumor effect of ATO has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of autophagy in the antiangiogenic effect of ATO in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro and its underlying mechanism. Our data showed that ATO suppresses angiogenesis and induces autophagy in HUVECs through upregulation of forkhead box protein O3 (FoxO3a). Co-incubated with autophagy inhibitor or knockdown of FoxO3a effectively inhibited ATO-induced autophagy and reversed the antiangiogenic effect of ATO, indicating that ATO-induced autophagy plays an antiangiogenic role in HUVECs. Our results highlight the importance of autophagy in the antiangiogenic effect of ATO and provide an improved understanding of the function of ATO.",nocancer
"It has been suggested that sugar intake may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis. However, studies on this matter are lacking. Intima media thickness (IMT) is a well-established measurement of subclinical atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate the cross-sectional association between sugar intake (i.e., added, free and total sugar and sugar-rich foods and beverages) and IMT. Our study comprised 5269 individuals (45-73 years, 40% men) of the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study, a population-based cohort conducted in Sweden with data collected from 1991 to 1994. Measurements of IMT were performed with B-mode ultrasound at the right common carotid artery (IMTcca) and the bifurcation of the carotids (IMTbif). Dietary intake was estimated using a combination of a 7-day food record, diet questionnaire and interview. After adjusting for methodological, lifestyle and dietary confounders, no statistically significant associations were observed for any of the sugar intake variables and IMT. For example, added sugar intake presented no significant linear association with IMTcca or IMTbif (Ptrends: IMTcca 0.81 for men and 0.98 for women and IMTbif 0.20 for men and 0.40 for women). In conclusion, we found no clear association between sugar intake and IMT measurements in this study.",nocancer
"Dust samples were collected from roads of five distinct types of land use zones (National Highway, residential areas, sensitive areas, mining areas, and busy traffic areas) of Dhanbad to determine the pollution characteristics, health risk, and identifying the source of trace elements. The dust samples were segregated into <= 60 microm and trace elements like Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were analysed. Concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Mn were observed highest in the mining areas, whereas Ni, Pb, and Zn presented higher concentration values at National Highway and busy traffic zones. Cd showed highest geo-accumulation index (Igeo), contamination factor (Cf), and ecological risk (ER) among all the trace elements. The health risk assessment model was performed to assess the health effects of carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic pollutants caused due to multi-elemental exposure on adults and children. The significantly higher HQ (Hazard Quotient) and HI (Hazard Index) values posed by Cr, Fe, and Mn indicated potential non-carcinogenic risks to the people of Dhanbad. Similarly, values of CR (Cancer Risk) for Cd, Cr and Ni were within the range of 10-6-10-4, which indicated to cause carcinogenic risk to the population by the exposure of road dust. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Pearson correlation showed that coal mining activities in Jharia coalfield, coal-based industries like coke-oven plants, coal washeries and heavy vehicular load in the roads of Dhanbad were the major causes of emission of these trace elements.",nocancer
"Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) have emerged as increasingly important biomarkers, particularly in the diagnosis and prognosis of cancers. However, most SNVs are rarely detected in blood samples from cancer patients as they are surrounded by abundant concomitant wild-type nucleic acids. Herein, we design a system that features a combination of competitive DNA probe system (CDPS) and duplex-specific nuclease (DSN) that we referred to as CAD. A theoretical model was established for the CAD system based on reaction networks. Guided by the theoretical model, we found that a minor loss in sensitivity significantly improved the specificity of the system, thus creating a theoretical discrimination factor (DF) > 100 for most conditions. This non-equivalent tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity provides a new concept for the analysis of rare DNA-sequence variants. As a demonstration of practicality, we applied as-proposed CAD system to identify low variant allele frequency (VAF) in a synthetic template (0.1% VAF) and human genomic DNA (1% VAF). This work promises complete guidance for the design of enzyme-based nucleic acid analysis.",nocancer
"Since glyphosate was classified as potentially carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, public debate regarding the environmental impact and health risks from its use has intensified. Almost all regulatory agencies throughout the world have concluded that the judicious use of glyphosate does not pose risks to the environment and human health. However, on the last day of 2020 the Mexican government decreed a ban of this herbicide beginning January, 2024. In current Mexican agriculture there are no safer chemical and/or other weed management technologies that allow for the economical substitution of glyphosate for weed control. Many Mexican weed scientists agree that glyphosate use should be reduced, but not banned outright. This decree could have more negative economic and social consequences as well as environmental and human health risks than benefits, which could compromise the country's food and public security. Crop yields are projected by some to decline by up to 40% with this ban, increasing food prices, making food less accessible to low-income consumers. In addition, a black market for the smuggling and illegal sale of glyphosate is possible. The possible environmental, economic and social impacts caused by the glyphosate ban in Mexico are discussed, emphasizing on weed management. This article is protected by copyright.

"Oral organoids are complex 3-dimensional structures that develop from stem cells or organ-specific progenitors through a process of self-organization and re-create architectures and functionalities similar to in vivo organs and tissues in the oral and maxillofacial region. Recently, striking advancements have been made in the construction and application of oral organoids of the tooth, salivary gland, and tongue. Dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells isolated from tooth germs or derived from pluripotent stem cells could generate tooth germ-like organoids by self-organization in a specific culture system. Tooth organoids can also be constructed based on tissue engineering principles by seeding stem cells on a scaffold with the bioregulatory functions of odontogenic differentiation. Two main approaches have been used to construct salivary gland organoids: 1) incubation of salivary gland-derived stem/progenitor cells in a 3-dimensional culture system to form the structure of the gland through mimicking regenerative processes and 2) inducing of pluripotent stem cells to generate embryonic salivary glands by replicating the development process. Taste bud organoids can be generated by embedding isolated circumvallate papilla tissue in Matrigel with a mixture of growth factors, while lingual epithelial organoids have been constructed using lingual stem cells in a suitable culture system containing specific signaling molecules. These oral organoids usually maintain the main functions and characteristic structures of the corresponding organ to a certain extent. Furthermore, using cells isolated from patients, oral organoids could replicate specific diseases such as maxillofacial tumors and tooth dysplasia. Until now, oral organoids have been applied in the study of mechanisms of tooth development, pathology and regeneration of the salivary gland, and precision therapeutics for tongue cancer. These findings strongly demonstrate that the organoid technique is a novel paradigm for the study of the development, pathology, and regeneration of oral and maxillofacial tissue.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by binding to target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Because of the key part that miRNAs play, understanding the correct regulatory role of miRNAs in diverse patho-physiological conditions is of great interest. Although it is known that miRNAs act combinatorially to regulate genes, precise identification of miRNA-gene interactions and their specific functional roles in regulatory comodules remains a challenge. We developed THEIA, an effective method for simultaneously predicting miRNA-gene interactions and regulatory comodules, which group functionally related miRNAs and genes via non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). RESULTS: We apply THEIA to RNA sequencing data from breast invasive carcinoma samples and demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering biologically significant regulatory comodules that are significantly enriched in spatial miRNA clusters, biological pathways, and various cancers. CONCLUSIONS: THEIA is a theoretically rigorous optimization algorithm that simultaneously predicts the strength and direction (i.e., up-regulation or down-regulation) of the effect of modules of miRNAs on a gene. We posit that if THEIA is capable of recovering known clusters of genes and miRNA, then the clusters found by our method not previously identified by literature are also likely to have biological significance. We believe that these novel regulatory comodules found by our method will be a springboard for further research into the specific functional roles of these new functional ensembles of miRNAs and genes,especially those related to diseases like breast cancer.",nocancer
"Intestinal mucositis remains one of the most debilitating side effects related to chemotherapy. The onset and persistence of mucositis is an intricate physiological process involving cross-communication between the specific chemotherapeutic drug, the immune system, and gut microbes that results in a loss of mucosal integrity leading to gut-barrier dysfunction. Intestinal mucositis has a severe impact on a patient's quality of life and negatively influences the outcome of treatment. Most importantly, intestinal mucositis is a major contributor to the decreased survival rates and early onset of death associated with certain chemotherapy treatments. Understanding the pathophysiology and symptomology of intestinal mucositis is important in reducing the negative consequences of this condition. Prophylaxis, early diagnosis, and proper symptom management are essential to improved survival outcomes in cancer patients. This review focuses on the pathobiology of intestinal mucositis that accompanies chemotherapy treatments. In addition, we will discuss the therapeutic potential of select strategies that have shown promise in mitigating chemotherapies' off-target effects without hampering their anti-cancer efficacy.",nocancer
"Carbonic anhydrase IX (hCAIX) is a membrane-spanning metalloenzyme, encoded by CA9 gene, which can lead to various carcinomas if upregulated. Due to its overexpression in many cancer tissues, hCAIX has become a promising target for developing anticancer therapeutics. Furthermore, several classes of small-molecules have shown to inhibit the hCAIX expression. In this study, therefore, we screened (n = 42) plant-derived compounds to identify the most potent hCAIX inhibitors and to understand their interactions with hCAIX and drug candidacy through in silico approaches. Among all, only 3 compounds (i.e., fraxoside, scopolin, and xanthone,) provided higher binding affinity towards hCAIX protein as compared to the native ligand. In standard docking, scopolin showed -4.97 kcal/mol of binding energy with hCAIX while control ligand provided -4.45 kcal/mol. In precise docking, the highest binding affinity was found for fraxoside (-7.67 kcal/mol) as compared to -3.04 kcal/mol of the control. The Gibbs free energy (DeltaG) of these potent leads was also consistent and in support of the docking studies. The binding interactions were also found to be stable in dynamics simulation. Furthermore, analysis of protein-protein interactions and co-expression revealed the possible association of CA9 gene with other tumorous genes, especially angiogenesis factor HIF1A which will most likely be affected by the identified inhibitors. With further experimental validation, therefore, these potential inhibitors could be effective against hCAIX protein, thereby, paving the way for prospective anticancer therapeutics.",nocancer
"Cellular senescence is a heterogeneous process guided by genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, characterizing many types of somatic cells. It has been suggested as an aging hallmark that is believed to contribute to aging and chronic diseases. Senescent cells (SC) exhibit a specific senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), mainly characterized by the production of proinflammatory and matrix-degrading molecules. When SC accumulate, a chronic, systemic, low-grade inflammation, known as inflammaging, is induced. In turn, this chronic immune system activation results in reduced SC clearance thus establishing a vicious circle that fuels inflammaging. SC accumulation represents a causal factor for various age-related pathologies. Targeting of several aging hallmarks has been suggested as a strategy to ameliorate healthspan and possibly lifespan. Consequently, SC and SASP are viewed as potential therapeutic targets either through the selective killing of SC or the selective SASP blockage, through natural or synthetic compounds. These compounds are members of a family of agents called senotherapeutics divided into senolytics and senomorphics. Few of them are already in clinical trials, possibly representing a future treatment of age-related pathologies including diseases such as atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular diseases, hepatic steatosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and age-related macular degeneration. In this review, we present the already identified senolytics and senomorphics focusing on their redox-sensitive properties. We describe the studies that revealed their effects on cellular senescence and enabled their nomination as novel anti-aging agents. We refer to the senolytics that are already in clinical trials and we present various adverse effects exhibited by senotherapeutics so far. Finally, we discuss aspects of the senotherapeutics that need improvement and we suggest the design of future senotherapeutics to target specific redox-regulated signaling pathways implicated either in the regulation of SASP or in the elimination of SC.",nocancer
"Targeting of low-oxygen (hypoxic) environments found in many tumors using redox-active metal complexes is a strategy that can enhance efficacy and reduce side effects of chemotherapies. We have developed a series of Cu(II) complexes with tridentate pyridine aminophenolate-based ligands for preferential activation in the reduction window provided by hypoxic tissues. Furthermore, ligand functionalization with a CF3 pendant group provides a 19F spectroscopic handle for magnetic resonance studies of redox processes at the metal centre and behaviour in cellular environments. The phenol group in the ligand backbone was substituted at the para-position with H, Cl, and NO2    to modulate the reduction potential of the Cu(II) centre, giving a range of values below the window expected for hypoxic tissues. The NO2 substituted complex, which has the highest reduction potential, showed enhanced cytotoxic selectivity towards HeLa cells grown in hypoxic conditions. Cell death occurs via apoptosis, as determined by cell morphology analysis. A combination of 19F NMR and ICP-OES indicates localization of the NO2 complex in HeLa cell nuclei and increased cellular accumulation under hypoxia. This correlates with DNA nuclease activity being the likely origin of cytotoxic activity, as demonstrated by cleavage of DNA plasmids in the presence of the Cu(II) nitro complex and a reducing agent. Selective detection of the paramagnetic Cu(II) complexes and their diamagnetic ligands through 19F MRI suggests hypoxia targeting theranostic applications via redox activation.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Accurate recording of diagnosis (DX) data in electronic health records (EHRs) is important for clinical practice and learning health care. Previous studies show statistically stable patterns of data entry in EHRs that contribute to inaccurate DX, likely because of a lack of data entry support. We conducted qualitative research to characterize the preferences of oncological care providers on cancer DX data entry in EHRs during clinical practice. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews and focus groups to uncover common themes on DX data entry preferences and barriers to accurate DX recording. Then, we developed a survey questionnaire sent to a cohort of oncologists to verify the generalizability of our initial findings. We constrained our participants to a single specialty and institution to ensure similar clinical backgrounds and clinical experience with a single EHR system. RESULTS: A total of 12 neuro-oncologists and thoracic oncologists were involved in the interviews and focus groups. The survey developed from these two initial thrusts was distributed to 19 participants yielding a 94.7% survey response rate. Clinicians reported similar user interface experiences, barriers, and dissatisfaction with current DX entry systems including repetitive entry operations, difficulty in finding specific DX options, time-consuming interactions, and the need for workarounds to maintain efficiency. The survey revealed inefficient DX search interfaces and challenging entry processes as core barriers. CONCLUSION: Oncologists seem to be divided between specific DX data entry and time efficiency because of current interfaces and feel hindered by the burdensome and repetitive nature of EHR data entry. Oncologists' top concern for adopting data entry support interventions is ensuring that it provides significant time-saving benefits and increasing workflow efficiency. Future interventions should account for time efficiency, beyond ensuring data entry effectiveness.",nocancer
"Quinoline is one of the most important and versatile nitrogen heterocycles embodied in several biologically active molecules. Within the numerous quinolines developed as antiproliferative agents, this review is focused on compounds interfering with DNA structure or with proteins/enzymes involved in the regulation of double helix functional processes. In this light, a special focus is given to the quinoline compounds, acting with classical/well-known mechanisms of action (DNA intercalators or Topoisomerase inhibitors). In particular, the quinoline drugs amsacrine and camptothecin (CPT) have been studied as key lead compounds for the development of new agents with improved PK and tolerability properties. Moreover, notable attention has been paid to the quinoline molecules, which are able to interfere with emerging targets involved in cancer progression, as G-quadruplexes or the epigenetic ones (e.g.: histone deacetylase, DNA and histones methyltransferase). The antiproliferative and the enzymatic inhibition data of the reviewed compounds have been analyzed. Furthermore, concerning the SAR (structure-activity relationship) aspects, the most recurrent ligand-protein interactions are summarized, underling the structural requirements for each kind of mechanism of action.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of three common deformable image registration (DIR) packages across algorithms and institutions. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The Deformable Image Registration Evaluation Project (DIREP) provides ten virtual phantoms derived from computed tomography (CT) datasets of head-and-neck cancer patients over a single treatment course. Using the DIREP phantoms, DIR results from 35 institutions were submitted using either Velocity, MIM, or Eclipse. Submitted deformation vector fields (DVFs) were compared to ground-truth DVFs to calculate target registration error (TRE) for six regions of interest (ROIs). Statistical analysis was performed to determine the variability between each DIR software package and the variability of users within each algorithm. RESULTS: Overall mean TRE was 2.04 +- 0.35 mm for Velocity, 1.10 +- 0.29 mm for MIM, and 2.35 +- 0.15 mm for Eclipse. The MIM mean TRE was significantly different than both Velocity and Eclipse for all ROIs. Velocity and Eclipse mean TREs were not significantly different except for when evaluating the registration of the cord or mandible. Significant differences between institutions were found for the MIM and Velocity platforms. However, these differences could be explained by variations in Velocity DIR parameters and MIM software versions. CONCLUSIONS: Average TRE was shown to be <3 mm for all three software platforms. However, maximum errors could be larger than 2 cm indicating that care should be exercised when using DIR. While MIM performed statistically better than the other packages, all evaluated algorithms had an average TRE better than the largest voxel dimension. For the phantoms studied here, significant differences between algorithm users were minimal suggesting that the algorithm used may have more impact on DIR accuracy than the particular registration technique employed. A significant difference in TRE was discovered between MIM versions showing that DIR QA should be performed after software upgrades as recommended by TG-132.",nocancer
"Hyperlipidemia causes diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, Type II Diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. Drugs that specifically target HL associated diseases are required for treatment. 34 KEGG pathways targeted by lipid lowering drugs were used to construct a directed protein-protein interaction network and driver nodes were determined using CytoCtrlAnalyser plugin of Cytoscape 3.6. The involvement of driver nodes of HL in other diseases was verified using GWAS. The central nodes of the network and 34 overrepresented pathways had a critical role in Hyperlipidemia. The PI3K-AKT signalling pathway, non-essentiality, non-centrality and approved drug target status were the predominant features of the driver nodes. Next, a Random Forest classifier was trained on 1445 molecular descriptors calculated using PaDEL for 50 approved lipid lowering and 84 lipid raising drugs as the positive and negative training set respectively. The classifier showed average accuracy of 76.8 % during 5-fold cross validation with AUC of 0.79 +- 0.06 for the ROC curve. The classifier was applied to select molecules with favourable properties for lipid lowering from the 130 approved drugs interacting with the identified driver nodes. We have integrated diverse network data and machine learning to predict repurposing of nine drugs for treatment of HL associated diseases.",nocancer
"Iron is an essential element for life, as it is critical for oxygen transport, cellular respiration, DNA synthesis, and metabolism. Disruptions in iron metabolism have been associated with several complex diseases like diabetes, cancer, infection susceptibility, neurodegeneration, and others; however, the molecular mechanisms linking iron metabolism with these diseases are not fully understood. A commonly used model to study iron deficiency (ID) is yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we used quantitative (phospho)proteomics to explore the early (4 and 6 h) and late (12 h) response to ID. We showed that metabolic pathways like the Krebs cycle, amino acid, and ergosterol biosynthesis were affected by ID. In addition, during the late response, several proteins related to the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy were upregulated. We also explored the proteomic changes during a recovery period after 12 h of ID. Several proteins recovered their steady-state levels, but some others, such as cytochromes, did not recover during the time tested. Additionally, we showed that autophagy is active during ID, and some of the degraded proteins during ID can be rescued using KO strains for several key autophagy genes. Our results highlight the complex proteome changes occurring during ID and recovery. This study constitutes a valuable data set for researchers interested in iron biology, offering a temporal proteomic data set for ID, as well as a compendium the proteomic changes associated with episodes of iron recovery.",nocancer
"MOTIVATION: Identification of interactions between bioactive small molecules and target proteins is crucial for novel drug discovery, drug repurposing and uncovering off-target effects. Due to the tremendous size of the chemical space, experimental bioactivity screening efforts require the aid of computational approaches. Although deep learning models have been successful in predicting bioactive compounds, effective and comprehensive featurization of proteins, to be given as input to deep neural networks, remains a challenge. RESULTS: Here, we present a novel protein featurization approach to be used in deep learning-based compound-target protein binding affinity prediction. In the proposed method, multiple types of protein features such as sequence, structural, evolutionary and physicochemical properties are incorporated within multiple 2-D vectors, which is then fed to state-of-the-art pairwise input hybrid deep neural networks to predict the real-valued compound-target protein interactions. The method adopts the proteochemometric approach, where both the compound and target protein features are employed at the input level to model their interaction. The whole system is called MDeePred and it is a new method to be used for the purposes of computational drug discovery and repositioning. We evaluated MDeePred on well-known benchmark datasets and compared its performance with the state-of-the-art methods. We also performed in vitro comparative analysis of MDeePred predictions with selected kinase inhibitors' action on cancer cells. MDeePred is a scalable method with sufficiently high predictive performance. The featurization approach proposed here can also be utilized for other protein-related predictive tasks. AVAILABILITY: The source code, datasets, additional information and user instructions of MDeePred are available at https://github.com/cansyl/MDeePred. CONTACT: vatalay@metu.edu.tr.

"OBJECTIVE: As cancer treatments continue to improve, the incidence of spinal metastases and the need for surgical management of these with fixation procedures are growing rapidly. Traditionally metallic implants, composed of titanium alloy, have been used in surgical fixation of unstable or symptomatic vertebral metastases or traumatic injuries. Metallic implants, however, cause significant artifact on post-operative imaging, degrading image quality and limiting interpretation, and can also impair the planning and delivery of radiotherapy. Composite carbon fiber-based materials, such as carbon fiber-reinforced polyetheretherketone (PEEK), have been developed to overcome these issues and are now available for spinal fixation procedures. We aimed to review the multimodal imaging features of these new implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Current literature and a case example from our institution were used to describe the multimodal imaging characteristics and considerations of new carbon fiber-based spinal fixation implants. RESULTS: New carbon fiber-based spinal implants allow far greater visualization of surrounding structures on post-operative cross-sectional imaging, significantly improving diagnostic accuracy and precision of radiotherapy planning, and do not significantly absorb or scatter X-ray photons during radiotherapy delivery. There are, however, important surgical and radiologic considerations associated with the use of carbon fiber-based implants which radiologists must be aware of, such as implications for surgical planning and intra-operative fluoroscopic and post-operative plain radiographic imaging. CONCLUSION: The use of carbon fiber-based implants, rather than traditional metallic implants, for spinal fixation offers significant advantages for post-operative diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy planning and delivery.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Radiotherapy treatment planning based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) benefits from increased soft-tissue contrast and functional imaging. MRI-only planning is attractive but limited by the lack of electron density information required for dose calculation, and the difficulty to differentiate air and bone. MRI can map magnetic susceptibility to separate bone from air. A method is introduced to produce synthetic CT (sCT) through automatic voxel-wise assignment of CT numbers from an MRI dataset processed that includes magnetic susceptibility mapping. METHODS: Volumetric multi-echo gradient echo datasets were acquired in the heads of five healthy volunteers and fourteen patients with cancer using a 3 T MRI system. An algorithm for CT synthesis was designed using the volunteer data, based on fuzzy c-means clustering and adaptive thresholding of the MR data (magnitude, fat, water, and magnetic susceptibility). Susceptibility mapping was performed using a modified version of the iterative phase replacement algorithm. On patient data, the algorithm was assessed by direct comparison to X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. RESULTS: The skull, spine, teeth, and major sinuses were clearly distinguished in all sCT, from healthy volunteers and patients. The mean absolute CT number error between X-ray CT and sCT in patients ranged from 78 and 134 HU. CONCLUSION: Susceptibility mapping using MRI can differentiate air and bone for CT synthesis. The proposed method is automated, fast, and based on a commercially available MRI pulse sequence. The method avoids registration errors and does not rely on a priori information, making it suitable for nonstandard anatomy.",nocancer
"Background: In the United States, the percentage of hospitals over 50 beds with palliative care programs has risen substantially from 7% of hospitals in 2001 to 72% in 2017. Yet the dynamic nature of program adoption and closure over time is not known. Objective: To examine the rate of palliative care program adoption and closure and associated hospital and geographic characteristics in a national sample of U.S. hospitals. Design: Adoption and closure rates were calculated for 3696 U.S. hospitals between 2009 and 2017. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine the association between adoption and closure status and hospital, geographic, and community characteristics. Setting/Subjects: All nonfederal general medical and surgical, cancer, heart, and obstetric or gynecological hospitals, of all sizes, in the United States in operation in both 2009 and 2017. Results: By 2017, 34.9% (812/2327) of the hospitals without palliative care in 2009 had adopted palliative care programs, and 15.0% (205/1369) of the hospitals with programs had closed them. In multivariable models, hospitals in metropolitan areas, nonprofit and public hospitals (compared to for-profit hospitals), and those with residency training approval by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education were significantly more likely to adopt and significantly less likely to close palliative care programs during the study period. Conclusions: This study indicates that palliative care is not equitably adopted nor sustained by hospitals in the United States. Federal and state interventions may be required to ensure that high-quality care is available to our nation's sickest patients.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Interferon (IFN)-lambda1, also named Interleukin (IL)-29, is a new member of the Type III IFN or IFN-lambda family. IL-29 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many types of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. OBJECTIVE: To study the role of IL-29 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis vulgaris. METHODS: The authors detected the serum levels of IL-29 in forty-one patients with psoriasis vulgaris, twenty-three patients with atopic dermatitis and thirty-eight age and gender-matched controls by sandwich Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The effects of IL-29 on the expression of cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-17, IL-8, IL-4, IL10, Interferon (IFN-gamma) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), in PBMCs and HaCat cells were determined by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Our data indicated that serum IL-29 levels were significantly elevated in patients with psoriasis vulgaris when compared with atopic dermatitis patients and the control group. Moreover, Serum levels of IL-29 were closely associated with the severity of psoriasis vulgaris. Furthermore, IL-29 up-regulated the mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-alpha in PBMCs from psoriasis vulgaris patients. In addition, IL-29 enhanced the IL-6 and IL-8 expression from the HaCat cells. STUDY LIMITATIONS: Original article. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first observations on the association of IL-29 and psoriasis vulgaris and showed elevated IL-29 serum levels. The authors suggest that IL-29 may play a role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis vulgaris.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Aging is often associated with low-grade systemic inflammation and reduced anabolic hormone levels. To investigate whether lifelong exercise training can decrease the age-related low-grade inflammation and anabolic hormone levels, we examined hormonal and inflammatory parameters among highly-trained male masters athletes and age-matched non-athletes. METHODS: From 70 elite power and endurance master athletes - EMA (51.3 +- 8.0 yr), 32 young controls - YC (23.7 +- 3.9 yr) and 24 untrained age-matched controls - MAC (47.2 +- 8.0 yr) venous blood was drawn to measure inflammatory parameters (interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha] and interleukin-10 [IL-10]) and circulating hormones (luteinizing hormone [LH], total testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone-binding globulin [SHBG] and free androgen index [FAI]). RESULTS: EMA showed a better anti-inflammatory status than MAC (higher IL-10 and IL-10/IL-6 ratio and lower IL-6), but a lower anti-inflammatory status than YC (higher TNF-alpha) (p < 0.05). The MAC group had lower testosterone levels compared to the YC and EMA group (p < 0.05), and lower estradiol levels and testosterone/LH ratio compared to YC (p < 0.05). In the control groups (MAC and YC), testosterone correlated negatively with age and proinflammatory parameters, and positively with anti-inflammatory parameters. CONCLUSION: Elite master athletics elevated levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines above that seen in non-athlete peers and mitigated the age-related reduction in testosterone levels.",nocancer
"Recently, the gut microbiota has been found to be associated with many diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, depression, Parkinson's disease, cancer, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among various gut microbiota-derived metabolites (GMs), short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), bile acids (BAs), and tryptophan (TRP) metabolites are the most frequently discussed metabolites. LC-MS/MS shows advantages in quantifying the levels of metabolites with good sensitivity and selectivity; however, the poor ionization efficiency and polar characteristics of SCFAs make their analysis challenging, especially when analyzing plasma samples with low SCFA concentrations. Moreover, without characteristic fragment ions for unconjugated BAs and different detection ion modes for TRP metabolites and BAs, GM analysis is complex and time-consuming. To overcome these problems, we developed a derivatization method combined with LC-MS/MS to enhance the sensitivity and LC retention of GMs. Through derivatization with 3-nitrophenylhydrazine (3-NPH), 7 SCFAs, 9 bile acids, and 6 tryptophan metabolites can be simultaneously analyzed via separation within 14 min on a reversed-phase C18 column. For accurate quantification, 13C6-3NPH-labeled standards were used as one-to-one internal standards. This derivatization approach was optimized and then validated. We further applied this method to investigate the targeted GM profile in patients with CVD. The results showed a significant reduction in plasma butyrate levels in CVD patients compared with healthy controls, suggesting its potentially protective role in CVD. In summary, this work provides a sensitive and effective LC-MS/MS method for simultaneously quantifying gut microbiota-related metabolites in human plasma, which could benefit various future gut microbiota-related studies.",nocancer
"Photodynamic therapy is an attractive technique for various skin tumors and non-cancerous skin lesions. However, while the aim of photodynamic therapy is to target and damage only the malignant cells, it unavoidably affects some of the healthy cells surrounding the tumor as well. However, data on the effects of PDT to normal cells are scarce, and the characterization of the pathways activated after the photodamage of normal cells may help to improve clinical photodynamic therapy. In our study, primary human epidermal keratinocytes were used to evaluate photodynamic treatment effects of photosensitizers with different subcellular localization. We compared the response of keratinocytes to lysosomal photodamage induced by phthalocyanines, aluminum phthalocyanine disulfonate (AlPcS2a) or aluminum phthalocyanine tetrasulfonate (AlPcS4), and cellular membrane photodamage by m-tetra(3-hydroxyphenyl)-chlorin (mTHPC). Our data showed that mTHPC-PDT promoted autophagic flux, whereas lysosomal photodamage induced by aluminum phthalocyanines evoked differentiation and apoptosis. Photodamage by AlPcS2a, which is targeted to lysosomal membranes, induced keratinocyte differentiation and apoptosis more efficiently than AlPcS4, which is targeted to lysosomal lumen. Computational analysis of the interplay between these molecular pathways revealed that keratin 10 is the coordinating molecular hub of primary keratinocyte differentiation, apoptosis and autophagy.",nocancer
"Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a key enzyme in the human endocannabinoid system. It is also the main enzyme responsible for the conversion of 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) to arachidonic acid (AA), a precursor of prostaglandin synthesis. The inhibition of MAGL activity would be beneficial for the treatment of a wide range of diseases, such as inflammation, neurodegeneration, metabolic disorders and cancer. Here, the author reports the pharmacological evaluation of new disulfiram derivatives as potent inhibitors of MAGL. These analogues displayed high inhibition selectivity over fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), another endocannabinoid-hydrolyzing enzyme. In particular, compound 2i inhibited MAGL in the low micromolar range. However, it did not show any inhibitory activity against FAAH.",nocancer
"CD147 is involved in various physiological processes and plays important roles for tumor metastasis. Glycosylation of the protein determines numerous functions of CD147. Up to now, hardly any sensor has been developed for detecting glycosylation of CD147 in live cells. There is a pressing requirement of development of a selective and continuous biosensor for cell imaging. The emergence of gene-encoded fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor provides a new way to develop the sensors to analysts. We designed and constructed novel gene-encoded FRET proteins sensing glycosylation of CD147 by measuring FRET ratio of two intermolecular motifs. With the decrease of CD147 glycosylation level in cells, the FRET ratio increased significantly. The specificity of the sensor targeting to CD147 was also determined by siRNA interference experiment. Finally, continuous living cell image of deglycosylation process of CD147 using the newly developed sensor has been performed successfully. The work not only provides useful tools for analyzing glycosylation of CD147 in living cells, but also implicates alternative strategy for detecting other glycosylated proteins.",nocancer
"Aurora kinases are a family of serine/threonine kinases that play a crucial role in cell proliferation through the regulation of mitotic spindles. These kinases are the regulatory proteins localized in the various phases of the cell cycle and are involved in centrosome maturation, chromosome alignment, chromosomal segregation, and cytokinesis. They have emerged as one of the validated drug targets for anticancer drug discovery as their overexpression has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various carcinomas. Inhibitors of Aurora kinases induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells. Hence, the design and development of Aurora kinase inhibitors have been widely explored in recent years by the scientific community as potential anticancer agents. Various Aurora kinase inhibitors have been under preclinical and clinical investigations as antitumor agents. This review summarizes the recent strategies of various researchers for the design and development of Aurora kinase inhibitors belonging to different structural classes. Their bioactivity, SARs, molecular modelling, and mechanistic studies have also been described.

"Cisplatin (Cis) is an effective cancer therapy commonly employed in many therapeutic regimens. However, treatment regimens that contain either a high dose or cumulative doses of Cis could trigger liver damage. A unique study demonstrated that captopril (Cap) protects against Cis-induced liver toxicity, but only some liver function enzymes and some antioxidant enzymes were investigated in that study. Our study aims to elucidate the protective mechanism of Cap against Cis liver toxicity. Acute liver toxicity was induced in rats by injecting a single Cis dose (7.5 mg/kg) in three groups (n = 6). Two groups were pre-treated with low (50 mg/kg) and high (100 mg/kg) Cap doses for one week before Cis injection, and the third group was injected with Cis only. The high Cap dose significantly improved liver function markers (ALT, AST, and ALP) and hepatic tissue pathology. The low Cap dose significantly improved ALP and, to a lesser extent, hepatic tissue pathology. Both Cap doses significantly decreased liver contents of MDA, IL-1beta, and cleaved caspase-3; and liver protein expression of TNF-alpha, Bax, and caspase-3. The high Cap dose significantly increased liver contents of GSH, GPx, CAT, and SOD, and the liver protein expression of Bcl2. Moreover, only the high Cap dose significantly decreased liver IL-6 content and cytochrome C protein expression. Cap did not inhibit the antitumor impact of Cis against HCT116 cancer cells. Therefore, Cap restricts Cis-induced liver toxicity by reducing inflammation and apoptosis and augmenting the antioxidant system.",nocancer
"This study aimed to quantify the extent of heavy metal, non-metal and metalloid levels in the Campomanesia adamantium pulp obtained from an area crossed by road experiencing high large vehicle traffic and intensive agriculture modern farming, to monitor the health risks associated with pulp consumption by humans. For this purpose, in three spots located within this area, ripe fruits were collected on the roadside, bush and farm-margin. Pulp samples were digested by microwave-assisted equipment, and chemical elements were quantified by ICP OES. The concentrations of K, Pb, Se, Fe, Mo, Zn, Co, Ni and Mn in the pulp collected in roadside/bush points showed statistical differences (p < 0.05). The heavy metals and metalloid concentrations that exceeded FAO/WHO standards were ordered Pb > As > Mo > Co > Ni > Mn > Cr. Therefore, among these metalloid and heavy metals, As, Pb and Cr were found to be higher in farm-margin > roadside > bush (1.5 x 10-3, 1.1 x 10-3 and 6.2 x 10-4), respectively. Therefore, As is the most important metalloid with higher levels in farm-margin, roadside and bush (1.5 x 10-3, 1.0 x 10-3 and 6.0 x 10-4 > 10-6-10-4 and 3.33, 2.30 and 1.34 > 1), respectively, to total cancer risk and hazard quotient, if 10 g daily of pulp are consumed.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Pigmented lesions are uncommon in the oral mucosa, and studies investigating the incidence and types of these lesions are desired to improve the diagnostic knowledge of clinicians. The aim of this study was to analyze the distribution of oral pigmented lesions in a Brazilian population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective descriptive cross-sectional study was performed. Oral pigmented lesions were retrieved from the files of two oral and maxillofacial pathology services from Brazil over a 45-year period (1974-2019). The clinical data and the diagnoses of each case were retrieved and included in a Microsoft Excel  database. RESULTS: From 77.074 lesions diagnosed in this period, 761 (0.99%) represented pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa, including 351 (46.1%) melanocytic and 410 (53.9%) non-melanocytic lesions, with a higher incidence in females (73.2%) between the fourth and seventh decades of life. Amalgam tattoo (53.6%) represented the most common lesion, followed by melanotic macule (18.3%) and racial pigmentation (10.8%). Other pigmented lesions included nevus (9.9%), post-inflammatory pigmentation (3%), melanoma (2.1%), melanoacanthoma (1.4%), smoker's melanosis (0.4%), drug-induced pigmentation (0.3%), and melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy (0.1%). The buccal mucosa was the most commonly affected site (25.2%), followed by the alveolar ridge (14.5%), and gingiva (11.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The current findings were similar to previous studies with minor differences due methodology and characteristics of the services from where lesions were retrieved. The knowledge of these data may contribute to a better understanding of oral pigmented lesions and assist clinicians to better recognize and manage them.",nocancer
"Biopolymer-based nanomaterials have been developed as antimicrobial and anticancer agents due to their advanced physical, chemical and biomedical characteristics. Herein, chitosan-copper oxide nanomaterial was, successfully synthesized by a green method. In this process, copper salt was nucleated with Psidium guajava leaves extract in order to form the nanomaterial in the chitosan network. Attenuated total reflection-fourier transform, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Dynamic light scattering, Transmission electron microscope, Field emission scanning electron microscopy/Energy dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Photoluminescence spectroscopy techniques were, employed to characterize the synthesized nanomaterial. The average size of the nanomaterial was identified to be ~52.49 nm with XRD. The antibacterial study of CCuO NM showed higher activity than the commercial amoxicillin against gram-positive (G + ve) (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis) and gram-negative (G-ve) bacteria (Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli). CCuO NM showed in-vitro anticancer potential against human cervical cancer cells (Hela) with an IC50 concentration of 34.69 mug/mL. Photoluminescence spectrum of CCuO NM showed a green emission (oxygen vacancies) observed at ~516 nm, which is attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by the nanomaterial, which is believed, to be responsible for the biocidal (cell death) effects.

"OBJECT: Fusobacterium nucleatum (F.nucleatum), a gram-negative, obligately anaerobe of oral commensal,has been regarded as culprit of periodontal diseases previously and is being unveiled as possible pathogen of gastrointestinal disorders. The key virulence factor of F.nucleatum is FadA adhesin for binding and invading of the host's epithelial cells. Here, we detected fecal F.nucleatum and virulence gene fadA in patients with ulcerative colitis(UC) and evaluated the clinical relevance with UC. METHODS AND SUBJECTS: A total of 310 subjects were enrolled including 100 patients with UC, 70 healthy controls (HC), 70 patients with irritable bowel syndrome subtype diarrhea(IBS-D), and 70 colorectal cancer patients(CRC). Stool samples of UC patients compared with healthy controls as well as IBS-D and CRC patients were collected for Polymerase Chain Reaction(PCR) detection of F.nucleatum (based on 16s rRNA) and virulence gene fadA. RESULTS: The detection rate of 16s rRNA based PCR for F.nucleatum of UC patients(39/100, 39.00%) and CRC(26/70, 37.14%) patients are significantly higher than HC (12/70, 17.14%, P < 0.01) and IBS-D patients (14/70, 20.00%, P < 0.01). Moreover, 19 samples were detected fadA positive from 39 F.nucleatum positive samples of UC patients (19/39, 48.72%), which is significantly higher than HC(2/12, 16.66%, P < 0.05). There were 3 samples detected fadA positive from 14 F.nucleatum positive samples of IBS-D patients(3/14, 21.43%) and 13 out of 26(50.00%) of CRC patients, which were both no significant differences compared with UC patients(21.4% vs 48.72%, P > 0.05; 50.00% vs 48.72%, P > 0.05). For both F.nucleatum and fadA gene positive patients, there were no statistical significances between erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cells(WBC), and hemoglobin compared with negative patients(defined by either F.nucleatum or fadA negative, or both negative). However, it is worth noting that detection rate of F.nucleatum with virulence gene fadA in patients of severe ulcerative colitis was significantly higher than patients with mild and moderate colitis(28.89% vs 10.91%, P < 0.05). In addition, the fecal F.nucleatum and fadA gene positive patients were more likely to have pancolitis other than left-sided colitis(pancolitis/left-sided colitis: 26.92% vs 10.42%, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of F.nucleatum and fadA gene increased in UC patients, especially in patients with severe colitis and pancolitis. Strains of F.nucleatum harbored virulence gene fadA is suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of UC.",nocancer

"Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is emerging as a secondary infection in patients with COVID-19, which can present as alveolar disease, airway disease (ie, invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis), or both. Histopathology of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis in patients with severe COVID-19 confirms tracheal ulcers with tissue invasion of Aspergillus hyphae but without angioinvasion, which differs from patients with severe influenza, where early angioinvasion is observed. We argue that aggregation of predisposing factors (eg, factors that are defined by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer and Mycoses Study Group Education and Research Consortium or genetic polymorphisms), viral factors (eg, tropism and lytic effects), immune defence factors, and effects of concomitant therapies will determine whether and when the angioinvasion threshold is reached. Management of invasive Aspergillus tracheobronchitis should include reducing viral lytic effects, rebalancing immune dysregulation, and systemic and local antifungal therapy. Future study designs should involve approaches that aim to develop improved diagnostics for tissue invasion and airways involvement and identify the immune status of the patient to guide personalised immunotherapy.",nocancer
"Methylation of cytosine in CpG dinucleotides and histone lysine and arginine residues is a chromatin modification that critically contributes to the regulation of genome integrity, replication, and accessibility. A strong correlation exists between the genome-wide distribution of DNA and histone methylation, suggesting an intimate relationship between these epigenetic marks. Indeed, accumulating literature reveals complex mechanisms underlying the molecular crosstalk between DNA and histone methylation. These in vitro and in vivo discoveries are further supported by the finding that genes encoding DNA- and histone-modifying enzymes are often mutated in overlapping human diseases. Here, we summarize recent advances in understanding how DNA and histone methylation cooperate to maintain the cellular epigenomic landscape. We will also discuss the potential implication of these insights for understanding the etiology of, and developing biomarkers and therapies for, human congenital disorders and cancers that are driven by chromatin abnormalities.",nocancer
"Arsenic (As) is one of the most toxic and cancer-causing metals which is generally entered the food chain via intake of As contaminated water or food and harmed the life of living things especially human beings. Therefore, the reduction of As content in the food could be of great importance for healthy life. To reduce As contamination in the soil and food, the evaluation of plant-based As uptake and transportation mechanisms is critically needed. Different soil factors such as physical and chemical properties of soil, soil pH, As speciation, microbial abundance, soil phosphates, mineral nutrients, iron plaques and roots exudates effectively regulate the uptake and accumulation of As in different parts of plants. The detoxification mechanisms of As in plants depend upon aquaporins, membrane channels and different transporters that actively control the influx and efflux of As inside and outside of plant cells, respectively. The xylem loading is responsible for long-distance translocation of As and phloem loading involves in the partitioning of As into the grains. However, As detoxification mechanism based on the clear understandings of how As uptake, accumulations and translocation occur inside the plants and which factors participate to regulate these processes. Thus, in this review we emphasized the different soil factors and plant cell transporters that are critically responsible for As uptake, accumulation, translocation to different organs of plants to clearly understand the toxicity reasons in plants. This study could be helpful for further research to develop such strategies that may restrict As entry into plant cells and lead to high crop yield and safe food production.",nocancer
"Petroleum exploration has continued to impact negatively the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. Oil spills from petroleum exploration contaminate both the aquatic and non- aquatic environments and destroy the ecosystem which makes people in these regions to be prone to diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative disease, infertility, and sterility and also poverty. Some oxidative stress markers of the liver and muscle of fish (Clarias gariepinus) from Apata, Araromi, and Mahin rivers (located in the Niger Delta region) were compared with those of fish samples from a clean fish farm (control) in order to assess the level of pollution of the rivers. A significant increase in malondialdehyde level and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity as well as alterations in antioxidant status (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, and glutathione S-transferase) was observed in the organs of fish samples from Apata, Araromi, and Mahin rivers compared with the control. A significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MnPCEs) was also observed in the fish samples from these rivers in comparison with the control. Based on results of our research, we can conclude that these rivers are polluted mainly by oil spillage and other industrial activities; therefore, the consumption of aquatic organisms from these rivers and the use of water from the rivers for domestic activities might be unsafe.",nocancer
"Background: Risks attributed to chronic diseases, cancer, musculoskeletal discomfort, and infectious diseases among Indonesians were found to be associated with lifestyle behaviors, particularly in rural areas. The aim of this study was to examine the outcomes of a home-visiting lifestyle modification program on improving health risk behaviors among Indonesians living in rural areas. Methods: A total of 160 Indonesians living in rural hamlets in the Yogyakarta Region of Indonesia participated in the program in the period of June 21 to July 21, 2019. In the pre-intervention home interview, learning needs of diet, exercise, hand hygiene, and substance use were identified by using structured assessment tools. In the next home visit, the visitors provided health education and facilitated lifestyle planning based on the related affective and cognitive domains of learning. Subsequent follow-up interviews were conducted 3 weeks after intervention. Results: The results showed that the self-reported intake of vegetables, fruits, meat and salt, cooking with less oil, hand hygiene before eating, number of cigarettes smoked, and symptoms of muscle stiffness significantly improved after the intervention. The lifestyle modification program consisted of the affective and cognitive domains of learning, and could lead to the target behavioral changes in self-reported and observable measures over 1 month. Conclusions: The findings contributed to the framework of community-based health education for health risk reduction and behavioral modification in developing rural communities where health care resources were limited. Further studies with control groups and vigorous objective measures were recommended to elucidate its long-term impacts. The factors leading to its sustainability concerning collaborative care partnerships between community residents and faculty resources are worthy of continued exploration.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: In this article, we address questions regarding how people consider what they do or do not consent to and the reasons why. This article presents the findings of a citizen forum study conducted by the University of Geneva in partnership with the Geneva University Hospitals to explore the opinions and concerns of members of the public regarding predictive oncology, genetic sequencing, and cancer. METHODS: This paper presents the results of a citizen forum that included 73 participants. A research tool titled ""the mechanics of consent"" was designed for this study. This tool is a table encouraging participants to reflect on social and research actors, types of data, and desired levels of control while sharing different types of data with different actors. Participants' discussion that led to the completion of each table were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: The results are a compilation of responses from the mechanics of consent tool divided into two sections; the first presents quantitative results of collective responses regarding attitudes to consent to donate their data. The second section present qualitative findings emerged from the discussion amongst participants. DISCUSSION: Choice and control of personal data is crucial for the public to be able to decide who and how to trust. Key information to be disclosed to potential research participants shall include information about potential risks and benefits; who will be accessing and using their data; as well as assurances that their choice will be respected. Furthermore, researchers ought to make sure they are trustworthy, by acting in a competent, reliable, and honest manner. Governance systems ought to be better equipped to address ethical issues raise by the growing presence of non-traditional research actors, consent of exchanges of data via digital devices and online activity such as social media and fairness of data trading. Finally, informed consent is one of the various elements that contribute to conducting ethical research. More needs to be done to strengthen governance and ensure adequate protection of research participants, particularly to address issues related to predictive health analytics.",nocancer
"Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are long linear sulfated polysaccharides implicated in processes linked to disease development such as mucopolysaccharidosis, respiratory failure, cancer, and viral infections, thereby serving as potential biomarkers. A successful clinical translation of GAGs as biomarkers depends on the availability of standardized GAG measurements. However, owing to the analytical complexity associated with the quantification of GAG concentration and structural composition, a standardized method to simultaneously measure multiple GAGs is missing. In this study, we sought to characterize the analytical performance of a ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS)-based kit for the quantification of 17 free GAG disaccharides. The kit showed acceptable linearity, selectivity and specificity, accuracy and precision, and analyte stability in the absolute quantification of 15 disaccharides. In native human samples, here using urine as a reference matrix, the analytical performance of the kit was acceptable for the quantification of CS disaccharides. Intra- and inter-laboratory tests performed in an external laboratory demonstrated robust reproducibility of GAG measurements showing that the kit was acceptably standardized. In conclusion, these results indicated that the UHPLC-MS/MS kit was standardized for the simultaneous measurement of free GAG disaccharides allowing for comparability of measurements and enabling translational research.",nocancer
"Paprika powder is a good source of different carotenoids and polyphenols, which play a key role in preventing certain diseases (some kinds of cancer and cardiovascular diseases). They can also be used as natural food colorants. Organic production is characterized by strict rules, but products obtained in this way contain more bioactive compounds, such as carotenoids and polyphenols. The aim of this study was to measure and identify carotenoids and polyphenols in different paprika samples (sweet, hot, smoked, and chili) obtained by organic and conventional production. Quantitative and qualitative carotenoid and polyphenols analysis showed that the experimental samples contained different concentrations of these compounds.",nocancer
"AIMS: This study examined the cross-sectional association between diet quality and periodontal disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the Oral Infections, Glucose Intolerance and Insulin Resistance Study (ORIGINS), 923 individuals completed the National Cancer Institute's validated Diet History Questionnaire 1, from which the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) scores and A Priori Diet Quality Scores (APDQS) were calculated. Mean probing depth (MPD), mean clinical attachment loss (MAL) and % of sites bleeding on probing (%BOP) were derived from full-mouth periodontal exams. Multivariable adjusted linear and logistic regression models assessed the associations between diet quality and MPD, MAL, %BOP, and the odds of periodontitis (defined via the CDC/AAP classification). RESULTS: Alternative Healthy Eating Index and APDQS were not associated with MPD, MAL, or periodontitis. While AHEI was also not associated with %BOP, the APDQS was associated with %BOP (p = .03). Higher nut consumption was related to lower MPD (p = .03) and periodontitis odds (p = .03). Higher red meat consumption was associated with higher MPD (p = .01) and %BOP (p = .05). Higher trans-fatty acid consumption was also associated with increased %BOP (p = .05). CONCLUSION: Overall diet quality scores were not associated with periodontal status. Future studies are necessary to replicate the associations observed in this study to minimize the risk of false discovery.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Home palliative care services have played an essential role during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak by providing symptom control, drug procurement, and psychological support for frail patients and their families unable to leave their homes. AIM: To understand how home palliative care professionals were affected by the outbreak, describing changes and challenges in their daily work as well as their reactions to the Covid-19 pandemic in Italy. DESIGN: Qualitative study conducted using telephone semi-structured interviews, with thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Thirty home care professionals working for an Italian non-profit organization which provides home palliative care for cancer patients and their families. RESULTS: Three main themes were identified. The first theme showed both patient-related and practice-related challenges participants faced in their daily work, requiring the implementation of different communication methods and patient and family education on risk prevention. The second theme showed the perception of increased responsibility and being the only landmark for family played a decisive role in participants' positive attitude. The third theme highlighted the participants' perception of the critical role of a home care setting in this emergency situation. CONCLUSIONS: The first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic brought many challenges and stressors for home palliative care professionals. On the other side, they reported a satisfaction with their critical role in carrying out their work with patients at risk.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The capability of deep learning radiomics (DLR) to extract high-level medical imaging features has promoted the use of computer-aided diagnosis of breast mass detected on ultrasound. Recently, generative adversarial network (GAN) has aided in tackling a general issue in DLR, i.e., obtaining a sufficient number of medical images. However, GAN methods require a pair of input and labeled images, which require an exhaustive human annotation process that is very time-consuming. The aim of this paper is to develop a radiomics model based on a semi-supervised GAN method to perform data augmentation in breast ultrasound images. METHODS: A total of 1447 ultrasound images, including 767 benign masses and 680 malignant masses were acquired from a tertiary hospital. A semi-supervised GAN model was developed to augment the breast ultrasound images. The synthesized images were subsequently used to classify breast masses using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The model was validated using a 5-fold cross-validation method. RESULTS: The proposed GAN architecture generated high-quality breast ultrasound images, verified by two experienced radiologists. The improved performance of semi-supervised learning increased the quality of the synthetic data produced in comparison to the baseline method. We achieved more accurate breast mass classification results (accuracy 90.41%, sensitivity 87.94%, specificity 85.86%) with our synthetic data augmentation compared to other state-of-the-art methods. CONCLUSION: The proposed radiomics model has demonstrated a promising potential to synthesize and classify breast masses on ultrasound in a semi-supervised manner.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Biological tissues consist of heterogenous populations of cells. Because gene expression patterns from bulk tissue samples reflect the contributions from all cells in the tissue, understanding the contribution of individual cell types to the overall gene expression in the tissue is fundamentally important. We recently developed a computational method, CDSeq, that can simultaneously estimate both sample-specific cell-type proportions and cell-type-specific gene expression profiles using only bulk RNA-Seq counts from multiple samples. Here we present an R implementation of CDSeq (CDSeqR) with significant performance improvement over the original implementation in MATLAB and an added new function to aid cell type annotation. The R package would be of interest for the broader R community. RESULT: We developed a novel strategy to substantially improve computational efficiency in both speed and memory usage. In addition, we designed and implemented a new function for annotating the CDSeq estimated cell types using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. This function allows users to readily interpret and visualize the CDSeq estimated cell types. In addition, this new function further allows the users to annotate CDSeq-estimated cell types using marker genes. We carried out additional validations of the CDSeqR software using synthetic, real cell mixtures, and real bulk RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. CONCLUSIONS: The existing bulk RNA-seq repositories, such as TCGA and GTEx, provide enormous resources for better understanding changes in transcriptomics and human diseases. They are also potentially useful for studying cell-cell interactions in the tissue microenvironment. Bulk level analyses neglect tissue heterogeneity, however, and hinder investigation of a cell-type-specific expression. The CDSeqR package may aid in silico dissection of bulk expression data, enabling researchers to recover cell-type-specific information.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Statistical process control tools such as control charts were recommended by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group 218 for radiotherapy quality assurance. However, the tools needed to analyze multivariate, correlated data that is often encountered in treatment plan quality measures, are lacking. In this study, we develop quality control tools that can model multivariate plan quality measures with correlations and account for patient-specific risk-factors, without adding a significant burden to clinical workflow. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A multivariate, quality control chart is developed that includes a risk-adjustment model, Hotelling's T2 statistic, and principal component analysis (PCA). PCA accounts for correlations among a set of organ-at-risk (OAR) dose-volume histogram (DVH) points that serves as proxies for plan quality. Risk-adjustment models estimate the principal components from PCA using a set of patient- and treatment-specific risk factors. The resulting residuals from the risk-adjustment models are used to compute the Hotelling's T2 statistic; the corresponding multivariate control chart is then plotted based on the beta distribution followed by the statistic. Further, the box-cox transformation is used to account for non-normality in DVH points. We investigate the application of the proposed methodology via three multivariate control charts-a conventional chart that ignores risk-adjustment and PCA, a risk-adjusted chart ignoring PCA, and a PCA-based, risk-adjusted chart. These control charts are evaluated on 69 head-and-neck cases. RESULTS: The conventional multivariate control chart fails to account for important patient-specific risk factors, including volumes and cross-sectional areas of the tumor and OARs and distances in-between. This failure leads to a larger number of false alarms. While the multivariate risk-adjusted control chart is able to reduce false alarms, it fails to account for correlations in DVH points. The multivariate PCA-based, risk-adjusted control chart can detect unusual plans after accounting for the correlations. By replanning, improvements are shown on an unusual plan identified by both risk-adjusted methods. CONCLUSIONS: The multivariate risk-adjusted control chart developed here enables quality control of plans prior to delivery. This methodology is generic and can be readily applied for other radiotherapy quality assurance protocols, such as gamma analysis pass-rates.",nocancer
"A series of quinazolin-4-one Schiff bases were synthesized and tested in vitro for their cytotoxicity against two cancerous cell lines (MCF-7, Caco-2) and a human embryonic cell line (HEK-293) including their antibacterial evaluation against two Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacterial strains. Most of the quinazoline-schiff bases exhibited potent cytotoxicity against Caco-2. Compound 6f with the O-butyne functional group displayed three-fold higher cytotoxic activity (IC50 = 376.8 mM) as compared to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (IC50 = 1086.1 mM). However, all compounds were found to be toxic to HEK-293, except for compound 6h that showed ~three-fold lower toxicity and higher selectivity index than 5-FU.  Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis revealed that O-alkylation generally increased the anticancer activity and selectivity of quinazoline-4-one Schiff bases toward Caco-2 cells. The fluorinated Schiff-base generally exhibited even more significant cytotoxic activity compared to their chlorine analogues. Surprisingly, none of the quinazoline-4-one Schiff bases displayed encouraging antibacterial activity against the bacterial strains investigated. Most of the compounds were predicted to show compliance with the Lipinski parameters and ADMET profiles, indicating their drug-like properties.",nocancer
"Ferroptosis has recently attracted much interest because of its relevance to human diseases such as cancer and ischemia-reperfusion injury. We have reported that prolonged severe cold stress induces lipid peroxidation-dependent ferroptosis, but the upstream mechanism remains unknown. Here, using genome-wide CRISPR screening, we found that a mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake regulator, mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1), is required for generating lipid peroxide and subsequent ferroptosis under cold stress. Furthermore, the gatekeeping activity of MICU1 through mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) is suggested to be indispensable for cold stress-induced ferroptosis. MICU1 is required for mitochondrial Ca2+ increase, hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and subsequent lipid peroxidation under cold stress. Collectively, these findings suggest that the MICU1-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis-MMP hyperpolarization axis is involved in cold stress-induced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis.",nocancer

In this review, we summarize recent studies on immunotherapy and gene therapy including the topics of oncolytic immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, gene replacement, antisense oligonucleotides, RNA interference, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-based gene editing, transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and custom treatment for Epstein-Barr virus, human T-lymphotropic virus 1, hepatitis B virus, human papillomavirus, hepatitis C virus, herpesvirus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma, Merkel cell polyomavirus, and cytomegalovirus.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Ileum obstruction due to internal hernia beneath external iliac artery after pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is extremely rare. We reported a case of acute strangulated internal hernia between the left external iliac artery and psoas major as late complication of laparoscopic hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy. CASE PRESENTATION: A 46-year-old woman, who with histories of laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and PLND 9 years ago for the cervical malignant tumor, open appendectomy 18 years ago, visited our hospital complaining of aggravated left lower abdominal pain, bloating, nausea and vomiting from few hours ago. Left abdomen distention, tympanitic with rebound tenderness and muscular tension was detected during physical examinations. Accompanying with elevated inflammatory markers and mild intestinal dilatation showed in lab results and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) respectively. After carefully reading the CT images, a small bowel was found between the left external iliac artery (EIA) and the psoas major, combined with the patient's surgical history, we suspected it might be internal hernia. Eventually, the emergency laparoscopic laparotomy confirmed our conjecture, the gap between the iliac vessels and the psoas major was closed with an absorbable suture, the patient was discharged on the fourth postoperative day. CONCLUSION: Primary closure of peritoneal fissue maybe an effective measure to potentially prevent internal hernia. The choice of surgical approach for pelvic tumors still needs further exploration but faster diagnosis and immediate laparotomy might promise a better prognosis.",nocancer
"The bioessential nature of cobalt and the rich photochemistry of its coordination complexes can be exploited to develop potential next-generation photochemotherapeutics. A series of six novel mixed-ligand cobalt(III) complexes of the formulation [Co(B)2(L)]ClO4 (1-6), where B is an N,N-donor phenanthroline base, namely, 1,10-phenanthroline (phen in 1 and 4), dipyrido[3,2-d:2',3'-f]quinoxaline (dpq in 2 and 5), and dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine (dppz in 3 and 6), and L is an O,O-donor dianionic ligand derived from catechol (1,2-dihydroxybenzene, cat2-, in 1-3) or esculetin (6,7-dihydoxycoumarin, esc2-, in 4-6), have been prepared and characterized, and their light-triggered cytotoxicity has been studied in cancer cells. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction structures of complexes 1 (as PF6- salt, 1a) and 2 show distorted octahedral geometries around the cobalt(III) center formed by the set of N4O2 donor atoms. The low-spin and 1:1 electrolytic complexes 1-6 display a d-d transition around 700 nm. Complexes 4-6 with a coordinated esc2- ligand additionally display a pi   pi* intraligand transition centered at 403 nm. Complexes 4-6 possessing a naturally occurring and photoactive esc2- ligand show high visible-light-triggered cytotoxicity against HeLa and MCF-7 cancer cells, yielding remarkably low micromolar IC50 values while being much less toxic under dark conditions. Control complexes 1-3 possessing the photoinactive cat2- ligand show significantly less cytotoxicity either in the presence of light or in the dark. The complex-induced cell death is apoptotic in nature caused by the formation of reactive oxygen species via a type 1 photoredox pathway. Fluorescence microscopy of HeLa cells treated with complex 6 reveals mitochondrial localization of the complex. A significant decrease in the dark toxicity of free esculetin and dppz base is observed upon coordination to cobalt(III). Complexes bind to calf-thymus DNA with significant affinity, but 6 binds with the greatest affinity. Complex 6 efficiently photocleaves supercoiled DNA to its nicked circular form when irradiated with visible light via a photoredox type 1 pathway involving hydroxyl radicals (HO ). Thus, complex 6 showing remarkable visible-light-triggered cytotoxicity but negligible toxicity in the dark is a good candidate for cancer photochemotherapy applications.",nocancer
"The geographical distribution of mortality has frequently been studied. Nevertheless, those studies often consider isolated causes of death. In this work, we aim to study the geographical distribution of mortality in urban areas, in particular, in 26 Spanish cities. We perform an overall study of 16 causes of death, considering that their geographical patterns could be dependent and estimating the dependence between the causes of death. We study the deaths in these 26 cities during the period 1996-2015 at the census tract level. A multivariate disease mapping model is used in order to solve the potential small area estimation problems that these data could show. We find that most of the geographical patterns found show positive correlations. This suggests the existence of a transversal geographical pattern, common to most causes of deaths, which determines those patterns to a higher/lower extent depending on each disease. The causes of death that exhibit that underlying pattern in a more prominent manner are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and cirrhosis for men and cardiovascular diseases and dementias for women. Such findings are quite consistent for most of the cities in the study. The high positive correlation found between geographical patterns reflects the existence of both high and low-risk areas in urban settings, in general terms for nearly all the causes of death. Moreover, the high-risk areas found often coincide with neighborhoods known for their high deprivation. Our results suggest that dependence among causes of death is a key aspect to be taken into account when mapping mortality, at least in urban contexts.",nocancer
"Reconstruction for large-scale temporomandibular joint (TMJ) defects can be challenging. We have used the medial femoral condyle (MFC) osseocartilaginous flap for repair of TMJ defects. The aim of this paper was to describe our technique and to present the preliminary results. The MFC osseocartilaginous flap was used as a free vascularized graft for TMJ defect in four patients who had undergone resection for benign tumor of the TMJ region (n = 2) or TMJ ankylosis (n=2). A computer-assisted technique was used in all cases. Symmetry of the mandible was objectively evaluated by postoperative computed tomography. Complications were recorded during follow-up visits. Lower extremity functional status was assessed by the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFC) questionnaire. The MFC osseocartilaginous flap success rate was 100%; bony union was obtained in all four patients, and normal occlusion was achieved within 6-11 months after surgery. No flap-related complications occurred. All patients were satisfied with their postoperative facial symmetry and oral function. The LEFC score ranged from 72 to 80, indicating normal lower extremity function. Vascularized MFC osseocartilaginous flap appears to be a reliable option for reconstruction of large-scale TMJ defects.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The involvement of gastrointestinal tract is rare in sarcoidosis. Endoscopic and histologic evaluation likely provides diagnostic clue in sarcoidosis patients. The aims were to assess the frequency of abnormal endoscopy and histology in patients with sarcoidosis undergoing endoscopic evaluation and to characterize the endoscopic and histologic features in sarcoidosis of the gastrointestinal tract. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that included 230 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of sarcoidosis in a tertiary care center. The endoscopic and pathology reports were assessed, and serum angiotensin converting enzyme analysis was performed. RESULTS: Of 230 patients, 63 upper endoscopies and 142 colonoscopies were performed. The most common indication for upper endoscopy was abdominal pain (36.8%) while colonoscopy was most frequently performed for colorectal cancer screening (58.2%). There were 25 upper gastrointestinal biopsies performed (biopsy rate 39.7%) with a diagnostic yield of 92.0% abnormal biopsies, of which the main findings were esophageal tissue eosinophilia, gastritis and duodenal villous blunting. There were 99 lower gastrointestinal biopsies (biopsy rate 64.1%) with a diagnostic yield of 68.7% abnormal biopsies for adenocarcinoma, adenoma, inflammation, low-grade dysplasia, or polyp. Only one gastric biopsy revealed evidence of non-necrotizing granulomas. Of note, patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy or colonoscopy were more likely to have underlying gastrointestinal comorbidities (62.5%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Patients with sarcoidosis undergoing endoscopic evaluation have high histologic abnormalities with a low probability of characteristic histologic (i.e. granulomas, Schaumann and asteroid bodies) findings.",nocancer
"Tissues are complex mixtures of different cell subtypes, and this diversity is increasingly characterized using high-throughput single cell analysis methods. However, these efforts are hindered, as tissues must first be dissociated into single cell suspensions using methods that are often inefficient, labor-intensive, highly variable, and potentially biased towards certain cell subtypes. Here, we present a microfluidic platform consisting of three tissue processing technologies that combine tissue digestion, disaggregation, and filtration. The platform is evaluated using a diverse array of tissues. For kidney and mammary tumor, microfluidic processing produces 2.5-fold more single cells. Single cell RNA sequencing further reveals that endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and basal epithelium are enriched without affecting stress response. For liver and heart, processing time is dramatically reduced. We also demonstrate that recovery of cells from the system at periodic intervals during processing increases hepatocyte and cardiomyocyte numbers, as well as increases reproducibility from batch-to-batch for all tissues.",nocancer

The mentioned areas that cover the women care in the center: Physical, Psychological, Social Support and Health Education. CONCLUSIONS: The attention by an interdisciplinary team becomes prevalent in the care of mastectomized women, since cancer and its treatment produce various changes in women's lives in the short and long term, so follow-up and support must be biopsychosocial, covering all areas that may be affected, especially during the pandemic.",nocancer
"A disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs) are key mediators of cell signaling by ectodomain shedding of various growth factors, cytokines, receptors and adhesion molecules at the cellular membrane. ADAMs regulate cell proliferation, cell growth, inflammation, and other regular cellular processes. ADAM17, the most extensively studied ADAM family member, is also known as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha converting enzyme (TACE). ADAMs-mediated shedding of cytokines such as TNF-alpha orchestrates immune system or inflammatory cascades and ADAMs-mediated shedding of growth factors causes cell growth or proliferation by transactivation of the growth factor receptors including epidermal growth factor receptor. Therefore, increased ADAMs-mediated shedding can induce inflammation, tissue remodeling and dysfunction associated with various cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis, and ADAMs can be a potential therapeutic target in these diseases. In this review, we focus on the role of ADAMs in cardiovascular pathophysiology and cardiovascular diseases. The main aim of this review is to stimulate new interest in this area by highlighting remarkable evidence.",nocancer
"RATIONALE: An important public health strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic was the protection of people at risk of severe progressions of an infection; namely, older people and people with pre-existing conditions. OBJECTIVE: To improve public health communication, it is vital to understand, which sociodemographic and psychological factors drive older people's acceptance of and compliance with public health measures. METHOD: This goal was pursued in this three-wave longitudinal online study with older adults, collected between March and June during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (N = 327; first and second wave during the national lockdown; third wave: after the lifting of most lockdown measures). RESULTS: The results show that overall acceptance of and adherence to the public health measures were high among older adults and even more so for people with pre-existing conditions (e.g., cancer, type II diabetes). However, some infringements of the measures were observed, and the longitudinal analyses suggest that increases in social trust positively influenced acceptance of measures over time, while trivialising beliefs and health fears impacted older adults' compliance with protective measures over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study offers insights into the behavioural responses of older adults to an ongoing threat and the associated uncertainty that is part of public communication about the pandemic and protective measures.",nocancer
"Leptospirosis, caused by pathogenic Leptospira species, is an essential but neglected zoonosis. There are more than 300 serovars of pathogenic Leptospira, while inactivated bacteria offers only short-term serovar-specific protection. Leptospirosis treatment is mainly dependent on the use of antibiotics. However, the side effects of antibiotics and the risk of antibiotic resistance remain major problems. Thus, alternative agents which are fewer side effects on humans and efficient in leptospirosis would be welcome. Many studies have reported that polysaccharides could be used as immunostimulants in treating infection and cancer. In this study, we examined the protective effect of polysaccharides isolated from Iris against leptospirosis. To our knowledge, it is the first time to report Iris polysaccharides (IP) as an immunostimulant in treating infection. The results showed that IP treatment significantly increased the survival rate of hamsters challenged by a lethal dose of leptospires. Besides, the tissue injury and leptospiral load were reduced in IP-treated infection group compared with the untreated infection group at 4 days post-infection (p.i.). Intriguingly, IP treatment sustained intense immune response at 4 days p.i. analyzed by qPCR. The results exhibited that the gene expression of TLR2 and TLR4 was significantly increased in the group coinjected with IP and leptospires than in the infected controls. And the expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha were also up-regulated after IP treatment, except the expression of IL-1beta in the kidney. Our results not only broaden the medicinal value of Iris, but also provide a competent candidate for the control of Leptospira infection.",nocancer
"Vorolanib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). A sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS assay was developed and fully validated for simultaneous quantification of vorolanib and its main metabolite X297 in human plasma. The two analytes were extracted from K2-EDTA plasma samples by protein precipitation (PP) with acetonitrile, and chromatographically separated on a C18 reverse-phase column using a gradient elution. A SCIEX 5500 QTRAP  mass spectrometer system was operated in multiple-reaction monitoring mode (MRM) and all components were detected using positive electrospray ionization (ESI). The results successfully demonstrated that the method had satisfactory linearity, sensitivity, and selectivity in the concentration ranges of vorolanib (1.00-1000 ng/mL) and X297 (0.500-500 ng/mL). In this study, two concentration related peaks in the vorolanib and X297 detection channels were observed, which were speculated to be isomers of vorolanib and X297. In order to standardize the sample pretreatment process, the effect of lamp light and pH on the isomer reconversion was evaluated. The results indicated, that the exposure of samples to lamp light during the handling procedures, did not cause the conversion of the isomers. For the first time a robust and specific ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) assay for the high-throughput quantification of vorolanib and X297 in human plasma was established and validated following bioanalytical validation guidelines. The proposed method was successfully applied to clinical trials evaluating the pharmacokinetics of vorolanib tablets in Chinese advanced solid tumor patients.",nocancer
"3alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3alpha-HSD) is an enzyme that is essential in the regulation of the concentration of 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5alpha-DHT) in the prostate. It catalyzes the hydride reduction of 5alpha-DHT to 3alpha-androstanediol, which activates androgen receptors. Elucidating details about the hydride reduction of 5alpha-DHT by 3alpha-HSD and the environment around the active site of the enzyme could lead to the development of effective drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. In this study, the X-ray crystal structure of human 3alpha-HSD type 3 was comprehensively evaluated. Moreover, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and hybrid ONIOM-type quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations were performed using a large QM region (maximum 232 atoms). It was determined that the reaction proceeded in a single step without the formation of an alkoxide ion owing to the direct hydride reduction of the substrate by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and concerted proton transfer by Tyr55 and Lys84. Noncovalent interaction (NCI) analysis highlighted the roles of Tyr216 and Trp227 in 3alpha-HSD. Specifically, Tyr216 assisted the reaction by pi/pi interactions with the neighboring nicotinamide ring of NADP(H), whereas Trp227 played an important role in recognition of the size of the substrate by CH/pi interactions.",nocancer
"The lungs are directly connected to the external environment, which makes them more vulnerable to infection and injury. They are protected by the respiratory epithelium and immune cells to maintain a dynamic balance. Both innate and adaptive immune cells are involved in the pathogenesis of lung diseases. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a subset of unconventional T cells, which have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Although MAIT cells account for a small part of the total immune cells in the lungs, evidence suggests that these cells are activated by T cell receptors and/or cytokine receptors and mediate immune response. They play an important role in immunosurveillance and immunity against microbial infection, and recent studies have shown that subsets of MAIT cells play a role in promoting pulmonary inflammation. Emerging data indicate that MAIT cells are involved in the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 and possible immunopathogenesis in COVID-19. Here, we introduce MAIT cell biology to clarify their role in the immune response. Then we review MAIT cells in human and murine lung diseases, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis and lung cancer, and discuss their possible protective and pathological effects. MAIT cells represent an attractive marker and potential therapeutic target for disease progression, thus providing new strategies for the treatment of lung diseases.",nocancer
"Many studies show that saponins isolated from various plants have a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells inducing apoptosis and autophagy. On the other hand, saponins also exhibit a number of beneficial properties, such as antioxidant properties. Thus, saponins can be considered both in terms of their therapeutic and protective effects during anticancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the effect of the saponin fraction isolated from sea buckthorn (Elaeagnus rhamnoides (L.) A. Nelson) leaves on the viability of HL-60 cancer cells using resazurin assay and its ability to induction of apoptosis with Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) double staining. Moreover, we studied its effect on the oxidative stress induced by H2O2, and anti-platelet and anticoagulant potential in whole blood using T-TAS, a microchip-based flow chamber system. We observed that the saponin fraction significantly decreased the viability of HL-60 cells at the concentration above 50 microg/mL and induced apoptosis at the concentration of 100 microg/mL. Moreover, we observed that saponin fraction used at lower concentrations, such as 0.5 and 1 microg/mL, stimulated HL-60 cells and increased their viability. The saponin fraction also decreased the level of free radicals and reduced oxidative DNA damage measured by the comet assay. However, at high concentration of oxidant H2O2 equal 5 mM, we noticed that the saponin fraction at 50 microg/mL increased the level of free radicals in HL-60 cells. We also demonstrated anticoagulant potential of the saponin fraction at the concentration of 50 microg/mL. Our results indicate that the saponin fraction obtained from sea buckthorn leaves can show both chemotherapeutic and chemoprotective potential.",nocancer
"The combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy is a prospective strategy to improve antitumor efficacy. Herein, a series of novel cytotoxic chlorin-based derivatives as dual photosensitizers (PSs) and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) were synthesized and investigated for biological activity. Among them, compound 15e showed definite HDAC2 and 10 inhibitory activities by up-regulating expression of acetyl-H4 and highest phototoxicity and dark-toxicity, which was more phototoxic than Talaporfin as a PS while with stronger dark-toxicity compared to vorinostat (SAHA) as a HDACI. The biological assays demonstrated that 15e was liable to enter A549 cells and localized in mitochondria, lysosomes, golgi and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) etc. multiple organelles, resulting in higher cell apoptosis rate and ROS production compared to Talaporfin. Moreover, it could induce tumor cell autophagy as a dual PS and HDACI. All results suggested that compound 15e could be applied as a potential dual cytotoxic drug for PDT and chemotherapy.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Adherence to levothyroxine (LT4) and attaining thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) goal in pregnancy has not been well-defined yet. We aimed to investigate adherence to LT4, success to reach TSH goal, and association between them in pregnant women with primary hypothyroidism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) was applied in third trimester in pregnant women with primary hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's thyroiditis, surgical hypothyroidism or iodine deficiency) whom LT4 was given for at least 3 months. Those with chronic illness or thyroid cancer were excluded. We grouped the patients according to MMAS-8 score (<6, low adherence vs >=6, medium/high adherence), and TSH measurement in third trimester (in-range vs out-of-range). RESULTS: Of total (n = 85), 57.64% (n = 49) had medium/high adherence to LT4, and 41.17% (n = 35) out-of-range TSH, but no association was found among them (P = .937). LT4 initiation in pregestational period, surgical hypothyroidism, high LT4 dose in second/third trimester and alternate-day dosing were associated with medium/high adherence. Age, number of visits, and less time between ingestion of LT4 and breakfast were associated with medium/high adherence. LT4 dose in second trimester and dose increment at the beginning of pregnancy were positively associated with in-range TSH. CONCLUSION: Non-adherence and treatment failure are frequent in LT4-treated pregnant women. Adherence seems not to be associated with treatment success. Regular follow-up may improve adherence. Our study is the first to analyse both treatment success and adherence to LT4 in pregnancy.",nocancer
"Sulforaphane (SFN) is a phytochemical compound extracted from cruciferous plants, like broccoli or cauliflower. Its isothiocyanate group renders SFN reactive, thus allowing post-translational modification of cellular proteins to regulate their function with the potential for biological and therapeutic actions. SFN and stabilized variants recently received regulatory approval for clinical studies in humans for the treatment of neurological disorders and cancer. Potential unwanted side effects of SFN on heart function have not been investigated yet. The present study characterizes the impact of SFN on cardiomyocyte contractile function in cardiac preparations from neonatal rat, adult mouse and human induced-pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. This revealed a SFN-mediated negative inotropic effect, when administered either acutely or chronically, with an impairment of the Frank-Starling response to stretch activation. A direct effect of SFN on myofilament function was excluded in chemically permeabilized mouse trabeculae. However, SFN pretreatment increased lactate formation and enhanced the mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species accompanied by a significant reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential. Transmission electron microscopy revealed disturbed sarcomeric organization and inflated mitochondria with whorled membrane shape in response to SFN exposure. Interestingly, administration of the alternative energy source l-glutamine to the medium that bypasses the uptake route of pyruvate into the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle improved force development in SFN-treated EHTs, suggesting indeed mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor of SFN-mediated contractile dysfunction. Taken together, the data from the present study suggest that SFN might impact negatively on cardiac contractility in patients with cardiovascular co-morbidities undergoing SFN supplementation therapy. Therefore, cardiac function should be monitored regularly to avoid the onset of cardiotoxic side effects.",nocancer
"Edible mushrooms have been increasingly introduced into the human diet, which has driven research into their functional properties. Thus, Agaricus brasiliensis Murill or Agaricus blazei Murill (ABM) is a species native to the Brazilian biome, whose fruitful body has been used not only for dietary purposes, but also in the development of functional foods or as source of molecules of pharmacological interest. The bioactivity of ABM has been related to the presence of polysaccharides, although the contribution of others metabolites cannot be discharged. This work describes the polysaccharides isolation methodology and preparation of the extracts of ABM and their biological activities. Furthermore, it presents a general outline of its characterizations regarding composition, chemical structure and properties in solution. The ABM and its chemical constituents exhibit several biological activities that support their potential use for prevention or treatment of diseases with inflammatory background, such as cancer, diabetes and atherosclerosis. The mechanism of action of the extracts and polysaccharides from ABM is mainly related to a modulation of immune system response or reduction of inflammatory response. This review shows that the ABM has great potential in the pharmaceutical, biotechnological and food sectors that deserves additional research using standardized products.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Due to the non-randomized nature of real-world data, prognostic factors need to be balanced, which is often done by propensity scores (PS). This study aimed to investigate whether autoencoders, which are unsupervised deep learning architectures, might be leveraged to compute PS. METHODS: We selected patient-level data of 128,368 first-line treated cancer patients from the Flatiron Health EHR-derived de-identified database. We trained an autoencoder architecture to learn a lower-dimensional patient representation, which we used to compute PS. To compare the performance of an autoencoder-based PS with established methods, we performed a simulation study. We assessed the balancing and adjustment performance using standardized mean differences (SMD), root-mean-square-errors (RMSE), percent bias and confidence interval (CI) coverage. To illustrate the application of the autoencoder-based PS, we emulated the PRONOUNCE trial by applying the trial's protocol elements within an observational database setting, comparing two chemotherapy regimens. RESULTS: All methods but the manual variable selection approach led to well-balanced cohorts with average SMDs <0.1. LASSO yielded on average the lowest deviation of resulting estimates (RMSE 0.0205) followed by the autoencoder approach (RMSE 0.0248). Altering the hyperparameter setup in sensitivity analysis, the autoencoder approach led to similar results as LASSO (RMSE 0.0203 and 0.0205, respectively). In the case study, all methods provided a similar conclusion with point estimates clustered around the null (e.g. HRautoencoder 1.01 [95% CI 0.80-1.27] vs. HRPRONOUNCE 1.07 [0.83-1.36]). INTERPRETATION: Autoencoder-based PS computation was a feasible approach to control for confounding but did not perform better than some established approaches like LASSO.",nocancer
"Due to the complicated pathogenic pathways of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), related medicinal therapies have remained a clinical challenge. COVID-19 highlights the urgent need to develop mechanistic pathogenic pathways and effective agents for preventing/treating future epidemics. As a result, the destructive pathways of COVID-19 are in the line with clinical symptoms induced by severe acute coronary syndrome (SARS), including lung failure and pneumonia. Accordingly, revealing the exact signaling pathways, including inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and autophagy, as well as relative representative mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), Bax/caspases, and Beclin/LC3, respectively, will pave the road for combating COVID-19. Prevailing host factors and multiple steps of SARS-CoV-2 attachment/entry, replication, and assembly/release would be hopeful strategies against COVID-19. This is a comprehensive review of the destructive signaling pathways and host-pathogen interaction of SARS-CoV-2, as well as related therapeutic targets and treatment strategies, including potential natural products-based candidates.",nocancer
"Rivers, the main source of the domestic water supply in Malaysia, have been threatened by frequent flooding in recent years. This study aims to assess human health risks associated with exposure to concentrated heavy metals in a flood-prone region of Malaysia and investigate the affected individuals' willingness to participate in managing water resources. Hazard indices and cancer risks associated with water contamination by heavy metals have been assessed following the method prescribed by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Yearly data of heavy metal contamination (Cd, Cr, Pb, Zn, Fe), water quality parameters (DO, BOD, COD, pH), and climatic information (annual rainfall, annual temperature) have been collected from the Department of Environment and Meteorological Department of Malaysia, respectively. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry technique has been used by the department of environment for analyzing heavy metal concentration in river water samples. In this study, data from a stratified random sample of households in the affected region were analyzed, using partial least squares structural equation modeling, to predict the link between individuals' perceptions and attitudes about water resources and their willingness to engage in water management program. The health risk estimation indicated that the hazard index values were below the acceptable limit, representing no non-carcinogenic risk to adults and children residing in the study area via oral intake and dermal adsorption of water. However, the calculated value for cancer risk signified possible carcinogenic risks associated with Pb and Cd. In general, contamination due to pollution and flooding tends to increase in the basin region, and appropriate management is needed. The results identified perceived water quality as a significant factor influencing people's attitudes toward involvement in water management programs. As in many developing countries, there is no legal provision guaranteeing public representation in water management in Malaysia. The conclusion discusses the importance of these for the literature and for informing future policy actions.",nocancer
"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most frequent cause of young-onset dementia. Even though immune-mediated and neuroinflammatory factors have been recognized as potential pathophysiological mechanisms, the role of specific immune molecules, such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, remains elusive. The aim of this study was to investigate TNF Superfamily Molecules (TNF, TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis [TWEAK], soluble TNF receptor type 1 [sTNFRI] and soluble TNF receptor type 2 [sTNFRII]) in patients with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and controls, and to explore potential associations with clinical parameters and brain atrophy. This study included two groups of participants matched for age, sex and schooling years: patients with probable bvFTD (n = 17, mean age = 64.9 years, 6 women/11 men) and healthy controls (HC, n = 17; mean age = 63.9 years, 10 women/7 men). All participants underwent comprehensive cognitive assessment and structural brain imaging with 3 T magnetic resonance imaging. Plasma levels of TNF, TWEAK, sTNFRI and sTNFRII were determined by ELISA. We conducted voxel-based morphometry analyses to investigate correlations between grey matter (GM) atrophy and plasma levels of TNF, TWEAK, sTNFRI and sTNFRII within bvFTD group. Compared to HC, bvFTD patients had lower cognitive scores and marked frontotemporal atrophy. Patients with bvFTD had significantly higher plasma levels of TNF (p < 0.0001), sTNFRI (p < 0.001), and sTNFRII (p < 0.0001), and similar levels of TWEAK in comparison with controls. The levels of sTNFRII were positively correlated with GM atrophy involving temporal poles, precuneus and cerebellum in bvFTD patients, while the levels of TWEAK positively correlated with right superior temporal gyrus. Our results implicate TNF superfamily in the pathophysiology of FTD.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Information on long-term dietary intake is often required for research or program planning, but surveys routinely use short-term assessments such as 24-h recalls (24HRs). Methods to reduce the impact of within-person variation in 24HRs, such as the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method, typically require extensive training and skill. OBJECTIVES: We introduce the Simulating Intake of Micronutrients for Policy Learning and Engagement (SIMPLE) macro, a new tool to increase the accessibility of 24HR analysis. We explain the underlying theory behind the tool and provide examples of potential applications. METHODS: The SIMPLE macro connects the core NCI statistical code to estimate usual intake distributions and includes additional code to enable advanced analyses such as predictive modeling. The related SIMPLE-Iron macro applies the full probability method to estimate inadequate iron intake, and the SIMPLE-1D macro is used for descriptive or modeling analyses of data with a single 24HR per person. The macros and associated documentations are freely available. We analyzed data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the Cameroon National Micronutrient Survey to compare the SIMPLE macro to 1) the core NCI code using the Estimated Average Requirement cut point method, and 2) the IMAPP software for iron only, and to demonstrate the applications of the SIMPLE macro for estimating usual intake and predictive modeling. RESULTS: The SIMPLE macro generates identical results to the core NCI code. The SIMPLE-Iron macro also produces estimates of inadequate iron intake comparable to the IMAPP software. The examples demonstrate application of the SIMPLE macro to 1) descriptive analyses of nutrient intake from food and supplements (NHANES), and 2) analyses accounting for breast-milk nutrient intake and modeling fortification and supplementation programs (Cameroon). CONCLUSIONS: The SIMPLE macros may facilitate the analysis and modeling of dietary data to inform nutrition research, programs, and policy.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Bioelectrical impedance analysis-derived phase angle (PhA) has been gaining attention in the clinical evaluation of nutritional status because it is thought to be a proxy of water distribution and body cell mass; it is also associated to muscle strength and is an effective predictor of different clinical outcomes. Since an association may be expected between PhA and sarcopenia (defined by low skeletal muscle mass and impaired muscle function), the aim of this systematic review was to evaluate: a) changes in PhA due to sarcopenia; b) prevalence of sarcopenia according to PhA values; c) derivation of phase angle cut-offs for detecting sarcopenia; d) sarcopenia and PhA as predictors of clinical outcomes. METHODS: A systematic research on electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science) from inception to January 31st, 2020 was performed according to PRISMA checklist. Using PICOS strategy, ""P"" corresponded to participants of any age, gender or ethnicity, ""I"" designated diagnosis of sarcopenia, ""C"" indicated subjects without sarcopenia, ""O"" corresponded to PhA, and ""S"" selected all study types. Methodological quality was assessed using the National Institute of Health (NIH) quality assessment tool. RESULTS: Through the initial literature search and after removing duplicates and excluding papers by screening titles and abstracts, 79 potentially relevant studies were examined. Thirteen studies (7668 subjects) met the inclusion criteria. The overall risk of bias was low. Sarcopenia was associated with a significant lower PhA in seven studies out of eight, while five studies out of six reported a high prevalence of sarcopenia was in patients with low PhA. Different cut-off point values from 4.05 to 5.05  have been derived for the identification of sarcopenia. PhA and sarcopenia were independent predictors of survival in cancer patients and geriatric hospitalized patients. CONCLUSIONS: Data from the selected papers demonstrate that PhA is decreased in sarcopenic subjects and the prevalence of sarcopenia is higher in subjects with low PhA. Further studies are needed to determine to what extent PhA may be valuable in detecting low muscle quality and/or identifying sarcopenia.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To identify psychosocial determinants of quit motivation in older deprived smokers. The evidence may be used to optimise smoking cessation interventions for the target population. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey using online recruitment methods including Facebook-targeted advertising. SETTING: UK, 2019. PARTICIPANTS: Current smokers aged 50 years or older and from a socioeconomically deprived background. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures included motivation to stop smoking, smoking history, perceived social support, self-efficacy for quitting, self-exempting beliefs and lung cancer risk perception. Multivariable regression was used to analyse factors associated with quit motivation. RESULTS: Of a total 578 individuals who consented to take part, 278 (48.1%) did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the 300 eligible participants, most were recruited using Facebook (94.0%), were aged 50-64 years (83.7%) and women (85.7%). Most participants were renting from a housing association (72.0%) and had low education (61.0%). Higher motivation to quit was statistically significantly associated with a higher intensity of previous quit attempts (p=0.03), higher quit confidence (p=0.01), higher smoking self-efficacy (p=0.01), a lower risk-minimising beliefs score (p=0.01) and using traditional nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) when trying to stop smoking or cut down (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Older smokers from deprived backgrounds face complex barriers to quitting smoking. Interventions are needed to increase self-efficacy for quitting, modify risk-minimising beliefs and target elements of previous quit attempts (ie, the use of NRT) that are associated with motivation to stop smoking.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the different profiles of dental service use by the Brazilian elderly and their possible association with sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, functionality and self-perception of oral health. METHODS: Cross-sectional population-based study, using secondary data from the National Health Survey (PNS) of 2013. The sample size was 2,969 elderly individuals. Latent Class Analysis was used to construct the dependent variable ""profile of dental service use"" from questions related to this profile. The independent variables formed 3 blocks: sociodemographic; comorbidities; functionalities and self-perception of oral health. The Rao-Scott Test and Standardized Residue Analysis tested the association. To measure the effect of covariates, Odds Ratio was estimated using a multiple hierarchical model of multinomial logistic regression. Significance level was 5%. RESULTS: Three latent classes were identified: Direct Disbursement Profile, Health Plan Profile and the Unified Health System (SUS) Profile. White elderly people were associated with the Direct Disbursement and Health Plans profile. The Health Plan profile was more associated with the married marital status or living with a spouse. In the multiple model, low schooling was associated with the profile of SUS users and elderly people diagnosed with cancer with the Health Plan profile. Self-perceiving oral health as bad or very bad increased the chances of belonging to the SUS profile. CONCLUSION: Latent Class Analysis proved to be a powerful strategy for a subtle and detailed understanding of the profile of dental service use and its relationship with associated factors.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of elderly patients with MS is increasing, in conjunction with the ageing general population. This review will examine the principal characteristics of elderly patients with MS and how the concomitant pathologies affect them. Finally, it will assess the impact of the medications on these patients and whether it would be safe to discontinue the disease-modifying treatment. METHODS: Searches using PubMed were conducted in October 2020 to collect studies assessing the impact of age and comorbidities on patients with MS. RESULTS: Several studies showed that aged patients develop concomitant pathologies that could worsen the disease's prognosis. Also, MS itself may be closely related to cognitive impairment, even though the exact etiopathogenic mechanism of it is still unclear. To date, safety and efficacy of currently available drugs remain unassessed in elderly populations. These treatments may not be beneficial in preventing the progression of disability in ageing people with no signs of inflammatory activity, and discontinuation of treatment is often discussed in this subgroup of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cardiovascular pathology, psychiatric disorders, diabetes or cancer is further associated with increased mortality in MS patients. The diagnosis and treatment of the disease is challenged by both age-related comorbidities and clinical variations compared to younger patients. It may be safe to discontinue treatment in elderly patients with no clinico-radiological activity.",nocancer
"Objectives: We present patterns of sunburn, sun safety behaviors and indoor tanning bed use in a nationally representative sample of schoolchildren aged 10-17. These behaviors were explored across gender, age, and social class groups. Methods: Within the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Ireland study, 10,271 young people (aged 13.54 +- 1.92, percentage girls 53.3%) reported frequency of sun safety behaviors, sunburn, and frequency and circumstances of indoor tanning bed use. Results: Children frequently experienced sunburn (90% lifetime, 74% last year), and 3% reported never using any sun protection. Applying sunscreen and wearing sunglasses were the most commonly used sun safety measures; other ways of sun protection were less popular. Indoor tanning bed use was reported by around 5%, and a large proportion of users were not advised of any indoor tanning safety measures. Sun safety behaviors varied by age and gender, with some socio-economic differences in tanning bed use. An association was found between frequency of family holidays abroad and sunburn. Conclusion: Targeted interventions are needed to increase sun safety behaviors and eliminate tanning bed use among children in Ireland.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the difference in pharygocutaneous fistula (PCF) development between pectoralis major flap onlay and interpositional reconstructions after salvage total laryngectomy (STL). DATA SOURCES: Medline, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review was performed during January 2020. English articles were included that described minor and major PCF rates after STL reconstructed with pectoralis major onlay or interposition. PCFs were classified as major when conservative therapy was unsuccessful and/or revision surgery was needed. Articles describing total laryngopharyngectomies were excluded. Meta-analyses of the resulting data were performed. RESULTS: Twenty-four articles met final criteria amassing 1304 patients. Three articles compared onlay with interposition, and 18 compared onlay with primary closure. Pectoralis interposition demonstrated elevated odds ratio (OR) of PCF formation as compared with onlay (OR, 2.34; P < .001). Onlay reconstruction reduced overall (OR, 0.32; P < .001) and major (OR, 0.21; P < .001) PCF development as compared with primary pharyngeal closure alone. Data were insufficient to compare interposition against primary closure. CONCLUSIONS: This research shows evidence that pectoralis onlay after STL diminishes the odds of total and major PCF development. Pectoralis interposition reconstruction showed elevated odds of PCF formation as compared with pectoralis onlay.",nocancer
"In this study, we report the effects of caffeine on angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos both during normal development and after exposure to Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2). As markers of angiogenesis, we measured the length and width of intersegmental vessels (ISVs), performed whole-mount in situ hybridization with fli1 and cadh5 vascular markers, and counted the number of interconnecting vessels (ICVs) in sub-intestinal venous plexus (SIVP). In addition, we measured angiogenesis after performing zebrafish yolk membrane (ZFYM) assay with microinjection of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and perivitelline tumor xenograft assay with microinjection of tumorigenic FGF2-overexpressing endothelial (FGF2-T-MAE) cells. The results showed that caffeine treatment causes a shortening and thinning of ISVs along with a decreased expression of the vascular marker genes and a decrease in the number of ICVs in the SIVP. Caffeine was also able to block angiogenesis induced by exogenous FGF2 or FGF2-producing cells. Overall, our results are suggestive of the inhibitory effect of caffeine in both direct and indirect angiogenesis.",nocancer
"STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of a mind-body exercise, qigong Baduanjin, on sleep disturbances in women experiencing intimate partner violence and explore the mediating role of depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and inflammation in producing the effects. METHODS: A subgroup of a parent randomized controlled trial, were randomized for a 22-week Baduanjin intervention (n=94) or wait-list control (n=92). Questionnaires including the General Sleep Disturbance Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory version II were administered at baseline, post-training (6 weeks), and post-intervention (22 weeks), and blood samples were collected to assess tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 levels at baseline and post-intervention only. RESULTS: Of the 186 participants, 170 completed the study. Results indicate that the total sleep disturbance scores for the intervention group were significantly lower than those for the wait-list control group at Week 6 (difference = -7.96; 95% CI, -13.63 to -2.30; P = 0.006) and Week 22 (difference = -7.17; 95% CI, -12.58 to -1.76; P = 0.01). Mediation analysis showed a statistically significant indirect effect of the intervention on sleep improvement through reducing depressive symptoms (beta=2.58, 95% CI, 0.69 to 5.09), while the mediating effects of perceived stress and inflammation were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Qigong Baduanjin can be recommended for women who experience intimate partner violence and report sleep disturbances. More research is needed to understand the clinical significance of the observed sleep improvements.

"Chronic stressors represented risk factors for the etiology or exacerbation of several gastrointestinal diseases. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic restraint stress (CRS) could initiate and aggravate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and metabolic disturbance of rats. Firstly, increased inflammatory cytokines (interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10(IL-10)) and decreased tight junction (TJ) proteins (occludin and zonula occludins-1 (ZO-1)) in rat colon were observed. Secondly, untargeted metabolomics based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) revealed that TRP metabolism was the most prominently affected. Thirdly, quantification of TRP and its metabolites via prominence ultrafast liquid chromatography coupled with a QTRAP 5500 mass (UFLC-QTRAP-5500/MS) showed that TRP, kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) were significantly increased. At the same time, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was unchanged and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid (5-HIAA) was significantly decreased in the colon of CRS rats. Besides, TRP metabolic enzyme changes were with the same trends as the corresponding metabolites. Thus, our data showed that CRS could initiate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and colonic metabolism disturbance, especially TRP-KYN metabolism pathway of rats, which may provide an experimental background for future research on stress-related gastrointestinal dysfunction. SIGNIFICANCE: Chronic exposure to psychological stress could induce metabolic imbalance of the body, and stressful life events were intimately correlated with frequent relapses in patients with intestinal disorders. The present study showed that chronic restraint stress (CRS) could initiate and aggravate colonic inflammation, integrity damage and metabolic disturbance, especially tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism of rats. Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway may be involved in the initiation and development of diseases induced by chronic stress. This research may shed light on future research on stress-related gastrointestinal dysfunction.",nocancer
"The biguanide metformin is the most commonly used antidiabetic drug. Recent studies show that metformin not only improves chronic inflammation by improving metabolic parameters but also has a direct anti-inflammatory effect. In light of these findings, it is essential to identify the inflammatory pathways targeted by metformin to develop a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of action of this drug. Commonly accepted mechanisms of metformin action include AMPK activation and inhibition of mTOR pathways, which are evaluated in multiple diseases. Additionally, metformin's action on mitochondrial function and cellular homeostasis processes such as autophagy, is of particular interest because of the importance of these mechanisms in maintaining cellular health. Both dysregulated mitochondria and failure of the autophagy pathways, the latter of which impair clearance of dysfunctional, damaged, or excess organelles, affect cellular health drastically and can trigger the onset of metabolic and age-related diseases. Immune cells are the fundamental cell types that govern the health of an organism. Thus, dysregulation of autophagy or mitochondrial function in immune cells has a remarkable effect on susceptibility to infections, response to vaccination, tumor onset, and the development of inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. Here we summarize the latest research on metformin's regulation of immune cell mitochondrial function and autophagy as evidence that new clinical trials on metformin with primary outcomes related to the immune system should be considered to treat immune-mediated diseases over the near term.",nocancer
"While Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a prominent cause of cervical cancer and mortality among underserved women, HPV vaccine completion rates remain stagnant (54%) among US adolescents. Our objective is to identify how adolescents' mothers' engagement with anti-vaccine versus pro-vaccine social media content is associated with their children's HPV vaccination rates via increased vaccine hesitancy. We employ the notion of loss aversion escalated in an emotion-laden circumstance in consumer behavior literature given that HPV vaccination decisions directly affect children's well-being. Based on this escalated loss aversion tendency for an emotion-laden decision, we explain why anti-vaccine content disproportionately increases mothers' overarching vaccine hesitancy, while pro-vaccine content does not decrease vaccine hesitancy. We conducted a population-based survey among 426 mothers of US adolescents aged 13-18. Our sample closely mimics the socioeconomic and demographic factors of the population group of mothers of adolescents in the US census. Our results show that anti-vaccine social media posts are associated with increases in mothers' overarching vaccine hesitancy and with decreases in their children's HPV vaccination rates, while pro-vaccine content has no significant association with either.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate in a sample of Chilean adult women, the association between adiposity markers with pattern and length of the menstrual cycle, assessing the influence of metabolic markers and hormones in this relationship. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 401 premenopausal women belonging to the DERCAM study (Determinants of Breast Cancer Risk) from Santiago, Chile. The menstrual cycle pattern was defined as regular or irregular, while menstrual cycle length was categorized as short (<=25 d), normal (26-31d), and long (>=32d). Adiposity markers included body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-hip ratio (WHR), and body fat percentage (BFP). Insulin, sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), androstenedione (A2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and progesterone were measured in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. RESULTS: There was no association between adiposity markers and cycle patterns. However, after all, metabolic and hormonal adjustments, women in the third tertile of BFP (RRR = 2.63; 95 % CI: 1.21.5.69) were more likely to have longer menstrual cycles. CONCLUSION: Women with high BFP presented a higher risk of having irregular menstrual cycles, which was an indicator of reproductive disorders; this relationship could be partially mediated by hormonal markers, especially SHBG, E1, and insulin levels.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: More and more countries utilize nurse anesthetists as an anesthetic care provider to make up for the insufficiency of anesthesiologists. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether introducing nurse anesthetists with expanded scope of practice to anesthetic care would jeopardize the safety of patients and quality of anesthetic care. DESIGN: This observational study used an interrupted time series design. SETTING(S): A metropolitan teaching cancer hospital located in Southwest China. PARTICIPANTS: 24290 patients with surgical procedures under general anesthesia from January 2015 to December 2017 were included. METHODS: In May 2016, nurse anesthetists with expanded scope of practice were introduced to anesthetic care. Administrative and medical record data were accessed to identify the occurrence of anesthetic outcomes including failed tracheal intubation and inability to ventilate with mask, aspiration, problem with airway in the post-anesthesia care room, hypothermia (temperature <= 35 C or chills), unplanned stay in the post-anesthesia care room longer than 3 hours, unexpected intensive care unit admission, reintubation, vascular and cardiopulmonary disorders and death. Statistical process control analysis was conducted to test special cause variation in outcomes over time. RESULTS: Findings demonstrated significant decrease in the proportion of patients staying in the post-anesthesia care room longer than 3 hours and with hypothermia following nurse anesthetists introduced to anesthetic care. Other anesthetic outcomes were not significantly changed. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that involvement of nurse anesthetists with expanded scope of practice in anesthetic care did not jeopardize patients' safety or quality of anesthesia. Moreover, it may have beneficial impact in preventing prolonged stay in the post-anesthesia care room and hypothermia. Further research is required to examine the impact of involvement of nurse anesthetists in anesthetic care across all clinical contexts.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Oxaliplatin, a third-generation platinum derivative is commonly used in combination treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Since 2008, it is the second most common cause of drug-induced immune hemolytic anemia (DIIHA) investigated in our laboratory. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Samples from fifteen patients including nine (60%) with intravascular hemolysis, suspected of having DIIHA were studied for the presence of anti-oxaliplatin. Direct antiglobulin tests (DATs) and tests with oxaliplatin-treated red blood cells (RBCs) or untreated and enzyme-treated RBCs in the presence of oxaliplatin were performed. A pool of normal AB sera with no unexpected antibodies was used as a control for nonimmunologic protein adsorption (NIPA). RESULTS: Eleven (73%) of the fifteen patients had antibodies to oxaliplatin that reacted with drug-treated RBCs and untreated RBCs in the presence of drug by tube and/or gel method. Lower-titer reactivity (<20) obtained with four patients' sera and the corresponding pooled normal sera was most likely due to NIPA. Eighty seven percent (13/15) of the patients had positive DAT either with anti-IgG only (33%), IgG + C3d (40%) or C3d only (13%). Two patients had a negative DAT. No directly agglutinating antibody was observed with the pools of normal donor's sera in the presence of oxaliplatin. CONCLUSION: Anti-oxaliplatin can cause severe intravascular hemolysis. Complement can usually be detected on the patient's RBCs and anti-oxaliplatin can be detected in the patient's serum. RBC-bound albumin detection with anti-human albumin needs to be performed to confirm NIPA which could have contributed to the patient's hemolytic anemia.",nocancer
"Seventy-five contaminants including chlorinated/brominated/parent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Cl/Br/PAHs) were investigated in 29 edible aquatic species from the Indian Ocean near Sri Lanka and 10 species from the Pacific Ocean near Japan. Concentrations of total ClPAHs and BrPAHs in the samples were 2.6-57 and 0.30-9.5 ng/g-dry weight from the Indian Ocean, and 0.35-18 and 0.03-3.3 ng/g-dry weight from the Pacific Ocean, respectively. Comparing the profiles of Cl/BrPAHs among the samples, congeners of chlorinated and brominated pyrene were predominant components and enhanced the potential for biomagnification in the sample from the off-shore pelagic environment in the Indian Ocean. The incremental lifetime cancer risks estimated by intake of the targets in consuming aquatic organisms showed that approximately one-third of studied organisms exceeded the acceptable risk level for Sri Lankans.",nocancer
"Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, a symptom of neutrophil depletion, makes cancer patients highly susceptible to invasive fungal infection with substantial morbidity and mortality. To address the cryptococcal brain infection in this condition, this study attempts to arm neutrophils (NEs) with antibiotics to potentiate the antifungal capability of NEs. To allow effective integration, amphotericin B, a potent antibiotic, is assembled with albumin nanoparticles through hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond interactions to form AmB@BSA nanoparticles (A-NPs). The nutrient composition (albumin) and virus-like size (~40 nm) facilitate efficient uptake of A-NPs by NEs to construct the antibiotics-armed NEs. It is demonstrated that the armed NEs can maintain the intrinsic biological functions of NEs, such as cell viability and capacity of migration to an inflammatory site. In a neutropenic mouse model of brain fungal infection, the treatment with the armed NEs allows for preventing fungal invasion more effectively than that with the native NEs, without the apparent systemic toxicity. Such a synergistic anti-infection system maximizes the antifungal effects by taking advantage of NEs and antibiotics. It provides a potential NEs-mediated therapeutic approach for treating fungal infection caused by chemotherapy-induced neutropenia.",nocancer
"In mammals, the white adipocyte is a cell type that is specialized for storage of energy (in the form of triacylglycerols) and for energy mobilization (as fatty acids). White adipocyte metabolism confers an essential role to adipose tissue in whole-body homeostasis. Dysfunction in white adipocyte metabolism is a cardinal event in the development of insulin resistance and associated disorders. This Review focuses on our current understanding of lipid and glucose metabolic pathways in the white adipocyte. We survey recent advances in humans on the importance of adipocyte hypertrophy and on the in vivo turnover of adipocytes and stored lipids. At the molecular level, the identification of novel regulators and of the interplay between metabolic pathways explains the fine-tuning between the anabolic and catabolic fates of fatty acids and glucose in different physiological states. We also examine the metabolic alterations involved in the genesis of obesity-associated metabolic disorders, lipodystrophic states, cancers and cancer-associated cachexia. New challenges include defining the heterogeneity of white adipocytes in different anatomical locations throughout the lifespan and investigating the importance of rhythmic processes. Targeting white fat metabolism offers opportunities for improved patient stratification and a wide, yet unexploited, range of therapeutic opportunities.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Intestinal adaptation has been extensively studied experimentally, but very limited data is available on human subjects. In this study we assessed intestinal adaption in humans with short bowel syndrome (SBS). METHODS: We comparatively evaluated mucosal hyperplasia, inflammation, barrier function and nutrient transport using histology, immunohistochemistry and qPCR for selected 52 key genes in duodenal biopsies obtained from children with SBS after weaning off parenteral nutrition (n = 33), and matched controls without intestinal pathology (n = 12). Small bowel dilatation was assessed from contrast small bowel series. RESULTS: Duodenal mucosa of SBS children showed increased histologic inflammation of lamina propria (p = 0.033) and mucosal mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor (p = 0.027), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta2 (p = 0.006) and caveolin-1 (CAV1; p = 0.001). Villus height, crypt depth, enterocyte proliferation, apoptosis and expression of proliferation and nutrient transport genes remained unchanged. Pathologic small bowel dilatation reduced crypt depth (p = 0.045) and downregulated mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-6 by three-fold (p = 0.008), while correlating negatively with IL6 (r = -0.609, p = 0.004). Loss of ileocecal valve (ICV) upregulated mRNA expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), TGF-beta1, CAV1, several apoptosis regulating genes, and mRNA expression of zonulin (p < 0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Despite successful adaptation to enteral autonomy, duodenal mucosa of SBS children displayed histologic and molecular signs of abnormal inflammation and regulation of epithelial permeability, whereas no structural or molecular signs of adaptive hyperplasia or enhanced nutrient transport were observed. Excessive dilatation of the remaining small bowel paralleled impaired duodenal crypt homeostasis, while absence of ICV modified regulation of mucosal inflammation, regeneration and permeability.

"Metabolic FLIM (fluorescence lifetime imaging) is used to image bioenergetic status in cells and tissue. Whereas an attribution of the fluorescence lifetime of coenzymes as an indicator for cell metabolism is mainly accepted, it is debated whether this is valid for the redox state of cells. In this regard, an innovative algorithm using the lifetime characteristics of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) (NAD(P)H) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) to calculate the fluorescence lifetime induced redox ratio (FLIRR) has been reported so far. We extended the FLIRR approach and present new results, which includes FLIM data of the various enzymes, such as NAD(P)H, FAD, as well as flavin mononucleotide (FMN). Our algorithm uses a two-exponential fitting procedure for the NAD(P)H autofluorescence and a three-exponential fit of the flavin signal. By extending the FLIRR approach, we introduced FLIRR1 as protein-bound NAD(P)H related to protein-bound FAD, FLIRR2 as protein-bound NAD(P)H related to free (unbound) FAD and FLIRR3 as protein-bound NAD(P)H related to protein-bound FMN. We compared the significance of extended FLIRR to the metabolic index, defined as the ratio of protein-bound NAD(P)H to free NAD(P)H. The statistically significant difference for tumor and normal cells was found to be highest for FLIRR1.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Acute encephalopathy, while a common presentation in the emergency department, is typically caused by a variety of metabolic, vascular, infectious, structural, or psychiatric etiologies. Among metabolic causes, hyperammonemia is relatively common and typically occurs in the setting of cirrhosis or liver dysfunction. However, noncirrhotic hyperammonemia is a rare occurrence and poses unique challenges for clinicians. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we report a rare case of a 50-year-old Caucasian female with history of bladder cancer status post chemotherapy, radical cystectomy, and ileocecal diversion who presented to the emergency department with severe altered mental status, combativeness, and a 3-day history of decreased urine output. Her laboratory tests were notable for hyperammonemia up to 289 mumol/L, hypokalemia, and hyperchloremic nonanion gap metabolic acidosis; her liver function tests were normal. Urine cultures were positive for Enterococcus faecium. Computed tomography imaging showed an intact ileoceal urinary diversion with chronic ileolithiasis. Upon administration of appropriate antibiotics, lactulose, and potassium citrate, she experienced rapid resolution of her encephalopathy and a significant reduction in hyperammonemia. Her hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis persisted, but her hypokalemia had resolved. CONCLUSION: This case is an example of one of the unique consequences of urinary diversions. Urothelial tissue is typically impermeable to urinary solutes. However, when bowel segments are used, abnormal absorption of solutes occurs, including exchange of urinary chloride for serum bicarbonate, leading to a persistent hyperchloremic nonanion gap metabolic acidosis. In addition, overproduction of ammonia from urea-producing organisms can lead to abnormal absorption into the blood and subsequent oversaturation of hepatic metabolic capacity with consequent hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Although this is a rare case, prompt identification and treatment of these metabolic abnormalities is critical to prevent severe central nervous system complications such as altered mental status, coma, and even death in patients with urinary diversions.",nocancer
"Given increasing concerns about the persistence and toxic effects of some sunscreen ingredients in aquatic ecosystems, several states, territories, and nations have banned the sale and/or possession of sunscreens containing chemicals of concern. Little is known, however, about the outcomes or effectiveness of these efforts to reduce the prevalence of toxic chemicals in coastal waters. This article reviews the state of knowledge relating to regulatory and other efforts to reduce the impact of chemical ingredients in sunscreens on aquatic ecosystems, focusing on the following questions: To what extent will local legislative restrictions on ingredients actually reduce the concentrations of chemicals in coastal waters and protect aquatic health? Do these legislative measures effectively decrease overall public use of sunscreens containing potentially harmful ingredients, or would other measures, such as local outreach programs, consumer education, or broader-scale ingredient regulation be more effective? How might restrictions on chemical UV filters impact human health? While it is still early to assess the outcomes of recent ingredient bans, their effectiveness is limited by the fact that legislation generally applies only to sunscreens sold within the legislating jurisdiction. Public awareness campaigns can be locally effective, but are hindered by the absence of clear environmental labelling standards for sunscreen. While retail and industry groups, and many dermatologists, cite concerns that sunscreen ingredient bans might lead to increased incidences of skin cancer, consumer preferences are influenced by a wide range of factors and no studies clearly document whether restrictions on chemical ingredients will cause people to use sun protection less frequently or less effectively. Until more information is available, many consider it prudent to take a precautionary approach to sunscreen regulation supported by broad scale, consistent regulatory policies and labelling standards that limit chemical ingredients to those considered safe for human use and ecosystem health.

"Novel dual redox/pH-sensitive star-like amphiphilic sucrose-oligo(butyl fumarate)(thioglycolic acid conjugate)-SS-poly(ethylene glycol) (Suc-OBF(TGA)-SS-PEG) copolymers and their self-assembled micelles were prepared and utilized for intracellular doxorubicin delivery. Importance of changing the hydrophobic chain length on micelles properties was investigated. Results showed that the micelles with longer hydrophobic chain exhibited smaller size and were more stable in aqueous solution. The redox and pH sensitivity of the micelles was confirmed by the change of micelle diameter/diameter distribution measured by dynamic light scattering and the change of micellar morphology observed by scanning electron microscope. The micelles display a decent doxorubicin loading capacity. In vitro release studies showed that only 14.3% doxorubicin was released from doxorubicin-loaded micelles under physiological conditions in 30h. The release of doxorubicin was accelerated at pH 5.5 or in the presence of 10mM glutathione at pH 7.4 (46.9% and 76.9% of doxorubicin was released, respectively, in 30h). The doxorubicin release was further expedited under pH 5.5 and 10mM GSH conditions (91.4%). Suc-OBF(TGA)-SS-PEG micelles displayed no cytotoxicity toward HDF cells. MTT assays indicated that doxorubicin-loaded micelles had good cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells. This work suggested that star-like amphiphilic Suc-OBF(TGA)-SS-PEG copolymer micelles may provide a promising platform for delivering doxorubicin and other hydrophobic anticancer drugs.",nocancer
"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor family of ligand-inducible transcription factors and regulates gene networks in biological processes such as cell growth and proliferation. Disruption of these networks by chemical compounds with estrogenic activity, can result in adverse outcomes such as unscheduled cell proliferation, ultimately culminating in tumor formation. To distinguish disruptive activation from normal physiological responses, it is essential to quantify relationships between different key events leading to a particular adverse outcome. For this purpose, we established fluorescent protein MCF7 reporter cell lines for ERalpha-induced proliferation by bacterial artificial chromosome-based tagging of three ERalpha target genes: GREB1, PGR and TFF1. These target genes are inducible by the non-genotoxic carcinogen and ERalpha agonist 17beta-estradiol in an ERalpha-dependent manner and are essential for ERalpha-dependent cell cycle progression and proliferation. The three GFP reporter cell lines were characterized in detail and showed different activation dynamics upon exposure to 17beta-estradiol. In addition, they demonstrated specific activation in response to other established reference estrogenic compounds of different potencies, with similar sensitivities as validated OECD test methods. This study shows that these fluorescent reporter cell lines can be used to monitor the spatial and temporal dynamics of ERalpha pathway activation at the single cell level for more mechanistic insight, thereby allowing a detailed assessment of the potential carcinogenic activity of estrogenic compounds in humans.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against IL-12/23 approved for induction and maintenance treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). Real-life data shows its true effectiveness in terms of clinical and endoscopic response. There is little information regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in CD patients receiving ustekinumab. Our main aim was to define long-term clinical remission and HRQoL normalization. As a secondary aim, we investigated clinical predictive factors of clinical remission. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was undertaken in CD patients under ustekinumab in Hospital Vall d'Hebron between January 2009 and January 2019. Clinical remission was defined by Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and HRQoL normalization was defined by the 36-item Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ). RESULTS: Thirty-three patients were included. Average disease evolution was of 11 years (standard deviation 8), perianal disease was present in thirteen patients (39%), thirty patients (91%) had previously been treated with antiTNF agents and twenty-two patients (67%) had history of intestinal resection. Twenty-four of them (73%) fulfilled one year of treatment. Seventeen patients (51%) reached clinical remission and six (18%) restored the HRQoL. We did not detect predictors of clinical remission. CONCLUSIONS: Ustekinumab shows clinical effectiveness in real-life conditions similar to previous data. Normalization of HRQoL is clearly low compared to clinical remission, attributable to the roughness of the indicator and the severe disease course. Such normalization is a challenge for physicians dealing with inflammatory bowel diseases.",nocancer
"Living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is sometimes associated with impaired regeneration and severe ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in the graft, resulting in small-for-size syndrome (SFSS). Platelets were previously reported to stimulate liver regeneration in models of hepatectomy, but the evidence in partial liver transplantation (LT) is lacking. In this study, a rat model of partial LT was used, and the impact of thrombopoietin-induced perioperative thrombocytosis on graft regeneration, I/R injury and survival was investigated. In experiment I, 30% partial LT was performed. Under thrombocytosis, SFSS was attenuated, as shown by decreased levels of serum aminotransferases, bilirubin and ascites. Serum hepatocyte regeneration-related cytokines, including insulin-like growth factor-1, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), were elevated. Additionally, the proliferative signaling pathways, Ki67-labeling index, PCNA-labeling index, mitotic index and liver/body weight ratio were increased under thrombocytosis. The platelet-induced regeneration was independent of thrombopoietin, as increases in the Ki67-labelling and PCNA-labelling indexes were abolished after reducing platelet counts by anti-platelet serum in rats administered with thrombopoietin. For I/R injury, thrombocytosis did not aggravate oxidative stress, downstream signaling pathways, necrosis or apoptosis in the graft. After Kupffer cell depletion, the platelet-induced attenuation of serum aminotransferases, increased serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and proliferation-related signaling pathways were abolished. Moreover, platelet accumulation in the graft decreased substantially. In experiment II, 20% partial LT was performed, and thrombocytosis improved postoperative survival. In conclusion, our results suggested that thrombocytosis stimulated graft regeneration and prolonged survival without aggregating I/R injury after partial LT, and Kupffer cells vitally contributed to platelet-derived regeneration. Platelet therapies to increase perioperative platelet counts may improve the outcomes after LDLT.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Identify the main stressors of the nursing team in assisting patients in oncology palliative care with suspicions and confirmed for COVID-19. METHODS: Qualitative, descriptive and exploratory study with theoretical framework in the psychodynamics of work, carried out in the emergency and hospitalization sector of a national reference center for cancer treatment in Rio de Janeiro/Brazil. The semi-structured interview was used to collect the data, from April to May 2020. The data were organized and analyzed using the Collective Subject Discourse (CSD) method with the aid of the Qualiquantisoft  software. RESULTS: Twenty members of the nursing team participated (10 nurses and 10 nursing technicians). After the analysis, three CSDs with their respective central ideas (CI) emerged. The CSD software, Qualiquantisoft , also provided a quantitative analysis of the responses, in which 12 (60%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with work organization, 6 (30%) of the respondents believe that the main stressors are associated to work relationships and 2 (10%) of respondents believe that the main stressors are associated with working conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The adaptations that took place in the management of care and in the organization of work, to better serve patients in oncology palliative care with suspicions and confirmed for COVID-19, brought greater impact and psychological stress on the nursing team. Considering all the difficulties and influences that the nursing team members are facing in this pandemic moment by COVID-19 associated with palliative oncology care, it is believed that identifying the source of the psychological stress presented by them may contribute to them have a more effective, humanized and holistic care, in addition to spreading knowledge to nursing and other segments of the health area and bringing subsidies to other scientific productions, as well as highlighting the importance of early detection of psychological stress as a way of preventing impacts physical and psychosocial problems caused by work.",nocancer
"In cancer cells, enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal alterations and/or increased deposition of acetylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) can support oncogene expression. However, how the chromatin conformation of enhancer-promoter interactions is affected by these events is unclear. In the present study, by comparing chromatin structure and H3K27ac levels in normal and lymphoma B cells, we show that enhancer-promoter-interacting regions assume different conformations according to the local abundance of H3K27ac. Genetic or pharmacological depletion of H3K27ac decreases the frequency and the spreading of these interactions, altering oncogene expression. Moreover, enhancer hijacking mediated by chromosomal translocations influences the epigenetic status of the regions flanking the breakpoint, prompting the formation of distinct intrachromosomal interactions in the two homologous chromosomes. These interactions are accompanied by allele-specific gene expression changes. Overall, our work indicates that H3K27ac dynamics modulates interaction frequency between regulatory regions and can lead to allele-specific chromatin configurations to sustain oncogene expression.",nocancer
"Accumulating research indicates robust associations between sense of control and salutary health and well-being outcomes. However, whether change in sense of control is associated with subsequent outcomes has been under-evaluated. Participants (N = 12,998) were from the Health and Retirement Study-a diverse, nationally representative, and longitudinal sample of U.S. adults aged >50 years. We examined how increase in sense of control (from t0:2006/2008 to t1: 2010/2012) was associated with better outcomes on 35 indicators of: physical-, behavioral-, and psychosocial-health (t2:2014/2016). We used multiple logistic-, linear-, and generalized-linear regression models and controlled for sociodemographic characteristics, personality traits, sense of control, and all outcomes in the pre-baseline wave (t0:2006/2008). During the 4-year follow-up, people in the highest (vs. lowest) quartile of sense of control, conditional on prior sense of control, had reduced risk of mortality and improved physical-health outcomes (lower risk of: stroke, lung disease, physical limitations, cognitive impairment, chronic pain and higher self-rated health). Sense of control was related to better health-behaviors (increased physical activity, reduced sleep problems), higher psychological well-being (positive affect, life satisfaction, optimism, purpose, personal-, health-, financial-mastery), lower psychological distress (depression, hopelessness, negative affect, perceived constraints), decreased loneliness, and increased contact with friends. Sense of control was unrelated to other physical health indicators (diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, cancer, arthritis, overweight/obesity), health behaviors (binge drinking, smoking), and social factors (living with spouse/partner, frequency of contact with children and other family). These findings underscore the importance of sense of control as a potential intervention target for fostering physical-, behavioral-, and psychosocial-health.",nocancer
"Neonicotinoid insecticides (NIIs) are extensively used worldwide and frequently detected in the environment. The human and ecological risks associated with the occurrence of NIIs in agricultural zones are of high importance. The present study highlights the regional occurrence and human exposure risks of NIIs in agricultural soil within the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. Six neonicotinoids, i.e., imidacloprid, clothianidin, acetamiprid, imidaclothiz, dinotefuran, and flonicamid, were measured in 351 soil samples from Zengcheng, a typical agricultural zone. The soil samples were categorized into three groups based on cultivated plants: vegetables, rice, and fruits. At least one of these neonicotinoid insecticides was detected in 95% of the soil samples. The levels of  6NII (range (median)) were 0.26-390 (23), 0.26-280 (6.1), and 0.26-120 (5.0) ng g-1 dry weight in soil samples from vegetable farms, rice paddies, and fruit farms, respectively. Neonicotinoids were detected more frequently and at statistically higher concentrations in vegetable farms than in both rice paddies and fruit farms. This is likely ascribed to higher application frequencies of NIIs in vegetable farms due to higher planting frequencies. The hazard index values for human exposure to NIIs in the agricultural soils were all below 1, suggesting negligible non-cancer risks. The current residual levels of NIIs in the soils could however pose sub-lethal or acute effects to non-target terrestrial organisms such as earthworms. The present study suggests that more information is needed regarding NIIs contamination in soils from agricultural regions of South China to ensure that human and ecological risk from exposure to these compounds can be fully addressed.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To investigate aqueous cytokine levels in association with hemorrhage in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Sixty-six eyes with treatment-naive PDR, including 26 hemorrhagic and 40 nonhemorrhagic eyes were included in this institutional study. Aqueous humor levels of interleukin (IL)-1b, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and soluble VEGF receptor-1 were obtained by multiplex bead assay. Visual acuity and hemorrhage area measurements were obtained, and correlations between cytokine levels and hemorrhage were identified. RESULTS: Levels of MCP-1, TNF-alpha, and VEGF were higher in hemorrhagic eyes (1506.77 vs. 2131.31 pg/mL, 0.43 vs. 0.63 pg/mL, and 103.96 vs. 206.96 pg/mL; P = 0.050, 0.022, and 0.027, respectively). The levels of IL-8, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, and VEGF showed positive correlation with visual acuity (P = 0.019, 0.015, 0.001, and 0.014, respectively). The hemorrhage area revealed positive correlation with TNF-alpha and VEGF levels (P = 0.001 and < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSION: The presence and amount of hemorrhage in PDR were associated not only with VEGF concentration, but also with the levels of certain inflammatory cytokines, suggesting a role of both VEGF and inflammation in hemorrhagic eyes.",nocancer
"Chemotherapeutic agents, which contain the Michael acceptor, are potent anticancer molecules by promoting intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In this study, we synthesized a panel of PL (piperlongumine) analogs with chlorine attaching at C2 and an electron-withdrawing/electron-donating group attaching to the aromatic ring. The results displayed that the strong electrophilicity group at the C2-C3 double bond of PL analogs plays an important role in the cytotoxicity whereas the electric effect of substituents, which attached to the aromatic ring, partly contributed to the anticancer activity. Moreover, the protein containing sulfydryl or seleno, such as TrxR, could be irreversibly inhibited by the C2-C3 double bond of PL analogs, and boost intracellular ROS generation. Then, the ROS accumulation could disrupt the redox balance, induce lipid peroxidation, lead to the loss of MMP (Mitochondrial Membrane Potential), and ultimately result in cell cycle arrest and A549 cell line death. In conclusion, PL analogs could induce in vitro cancer apoptosis through the inhibition of TrxR and ROS accumulation.",nocancer
"The present article reviews and compares the immunomodulatory activities of Crocus sativus (C. sativus) and Nigella sativa (N. sativa) and their main bioactive compounds. Immunomodulatory effects of these plants, especially with respect to Th1 and Th2 cytokines, are discussed based on relevant articles, books, and conference papers published in English until the end of April 2020, that were retrieved from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases. C. sativus and its constituents increase immunoglobulin (Ig-)G, interleukin 2 (IL)-2, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and IFN-gamma/IL-4 ratio, but decreased IgM, IL-10 and IL-4 secretion. N. sativa extract and thymoquinone reduce the levels of IL-2, -4, -10, and -12, while enhance IFN-gamma and serum IgG1 and 2a. The reviewed articles indicate that C. sativus and N. sativa and their constituents could be potentially considered promising treatments for disorders associated with immune-dysregulation such as asthma and cancer.",nocancer
"Extant fold-switching proteins remodel their secondary structures and change their functions in response to environmental stimuli. These shapeshifting proteins regulate biological processes and are associated with a number of diseases, including tuberculosis, cancer, Alzheimer's, and autoimmune disorders. Thus, predictive methods are needed to identify more fold-switching proteins, especially since all naturally occurring instances have been discovered by chance. In response to this need, two high-throughput predictive methods have recently been developed. Here we test them on ORF9b, a newly discovered fold switcher and potential therapeutic target from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Promisingly, both methods correctly indicate that ORF9b switches folds. We then tested the same two methods on ORF9b1, the ORF9b homolog from SARS-CoV-1. Again, both methods predict that ORF9b1 switches folds, a finding consistent with experimental binding studies. Together, these results (1) demonstrate that protein fold switching can be predicted using high-throughput computational approaches and (2) suggest that fold switching might be a general characteristic of ORF9b homologs.

"Angiogenesis is important for tumor growth, and accordingly, targeting angiogenesis has become an important pathway for antitumor therapy. A novel proapoptotic peptide, CIGB-300 (P15-Tat), has been shown to be involved in the casein kinase II phosphorylation pathway, conferring it with antiangiogenic activity. Cyclic peptides have been widely used as scaffolds in drug design studies due to their high stability and favorable biopharmaceutical properties. Here, we chose two very stable cyclic trypsin inhibitors, MCoTI-II and SFTI-1, as frameworks to incorporate the bioactive epitope P15 into various backbone loops. NMR studies revealed that all re-engineered analogs had similar secondary structures to their native cyclic frameworks. One key analog, MCoP15, displayed significant improvement for inhibiting human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration, was nontoxic, and had higher stability than the P15 epitope alone. Overall, the results show the value of P15 being engineered into cyclic trypsin inhibitor scaffolds for improving antiangiogenic activity and stability. More broadly, the study highlights the versatility of cyclic peptide frameworks in drug design for antiangiogenic therapies.",nocancer
"CD55 is a major regulator of the complement system, a complex network of proteins that cooperate to clear tissue and blood pathogens from the organism. Indeed, overexpression of CD55 is associated with many diseases and is connected to the resistance mechanisms exhibited by several cancers towards immunotherapy approaches. High level of CD55 expression on tumour cells renders it a good target for both imaging and immunotherapy. Indeed, a conceivable approach to tackle disease is to interfere with CD55-mediated complement regulation with the use of CD55-targeting antibodies. However, the large size and poor tissue penetration together with to the high costs of antibodies often limits their widespread therapeutic use. Here, we employed bioinformatic and chemical approaches to design and synthesize molecules of small dimensions able to mimic a CD55 blocking antibody. As a result, a bicyclic peptide, named as miniAB55, proved to bind CD55 with nanomolar affinity. This molecule represents an attracting chemical scaffold for CD55-directed diagnostic tools in diseases associated with CD55 overproduction. To further support the applicative potential of miniAB55, we prove that the miniAB55 binds CD55 on the same region involved in inactivation of the complement C3 and C5 convertases, thus opening promising scenarios for the development of complement-modulating tools.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The guidelines on pharmacotherapy for cancer-related pain advocate active measures against the adverse effects of opioids to increase adherence to medication. However, preventative therapy for the management of nausea and vomiting has not been specified. This study aimed to verify the effects of prophylactic anti-emetics in preventing opioid-induced nausea and vomiting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of cases at our hospital in which oral opioids or patches were initiated for the management of pain due to malignant tumours from January 2017 to September 2019. RESULTS: Strong opioids were initiated for 349 patients; of these, data for 298 patients were analysed. A total of 193 patients were on anti-emetic prophylaxis. We found that the group that did not receive anti-emetic prophylaxis was significantly more likely to be prescribed an additional anti-emetic. CONCLUSION: Prophylactic administration of anti-emetics at the time of initiating opioid analgesics may reduce gastrointestinal toxicity.",nocancer
"Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) calculations can provide high-confidence predictions of the interaction strength between a ligand and its protein target. We sought to explore a series of triazolopyrimidines which bind to the EED subunit of the PRC2 complex as potential anticancer therapeutics, using FEP calculations to inform compound design. Combining FEP predictions with a late-stage functionalisation (LSF) inspired synthetic approach allowed us to rapidly evaluate structural modifications in a previously unexplored region of the EED binding site. This approach generated a series of novel triazolopyrimidine EED ligands with improved physicochemical properties and which inhibit PRC2 methyltransferase activity in a cancer-relevant G401 cell line.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic wounds such as diabetic ulcers are a serious public health problem. Extensive research is needed to find new alternatives for wound treatment. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a non-invasive method, which has been studied for several decades to treat cancer, infections, and other diseases. PDT involves the administration of a photosensitizer compound followed by irradiation with using light at specific wavelength to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) using molecular oxygen. It is possible that low dose photodynamic therapy (LDPDT) could improve wound healing and stimulates the cell repair process. This study we explored the effect of LDPDT on wound healing in vitro using normal and diabetic cellular wound models. METHODS: The effects of different concentrations of 5-ALA and different energy densities (dark or light) on the cell viability of human fibroblast cells were studied using the MTT assay. After ascertaining the optimum parameters, a scratch wound assay was performed on both normal and diabetic cells and then cells treated with 1 and 5 mug/ml of 5-ALA at 1 J/cm2 energy density. ROS production and morphological alteration of the cells were studied. RESULTS: The mortality of normal fibroblast cells increased with increasing 5-ALA concentration and also increasing energy density (up to 3 J/cm2 ). However, in diabetic cells, the mortality rate did not decrease. Diabetic cells showed increased migration and closure of the scratch compared to normal cells under similar conditions. A low concentration of 5-ALA (5 mug/ml) and low energy density of 1 J/cm2 in both normal and diabetic cells gave a small increase in ROS levels compared to controls. This may explain the positive effects of LDPDT on wound healing. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that LDPDT may have a potential effect on the wound healing of diabetic wounds.

"Saturated fatty acids, whose circulating levels are markedly increased in the body, significantly affect the growth and functions of skeletal muscle. These fatty acids may exert a detrimental effect on the undifferentiated skeletal myoblasts that may adversely affect their differentiation. In the present study, the exposure of myoblasts to excess palmitic acid caused an elevation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha expression and an increase in reactive oxygen species levels consistent with the enhanced inflammation and oxidative stress. Various concentrations of palmitic acid significantly decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, induced the programmed cell death by an increase in the caspase-3 expression, and DNA fragmentation in the myoblasts. These findings suggest that the increased concentrations of saturated fatty acid in the myoblasts increase lipotoxicity by increasing inflammation and oxidative stress, decreasing the mitochondrial function, and inducing apoptosis.",nocancer
"Autoimmune and autoinflammatory rheumatic disorders (ARD) are treated with antimetabolites, calcineurin inhibitors and biologic agents either neutralizing cytokines [Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-17, B-cell activating factor] or being directed against B-cells (anti-CD-20), costimulatory molecules or JAK kinases. Similarly for the influenza or pneumococcal vaccines, there is limited data on the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 prevention for this susceptible patient population. Moreover, preliminary data from vaccinated organ transplanted, inflammatory bowel and connective tissue disease patients suggests only limited immunogenicity after the first vaccine dose, particularly in patients on immunosuppressive regimens. Herein a set of recommendations for the vaccination of immune suppressed patients with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is proposed aimed at achieving optimal vaccine benefit without interfering with disease activity status. Moreover, rare autoimmune adverse events related to vaccinations are discussed.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cancer care can be taxing. Alexithymia, a personality construct characterized by difficulties in identifying and describing feeling and emotions, an externally-oriented thinking style and scarcity of imagination and fantasy, is significantly correlated with higher levels of both secondary traumatic stress (STS) and burnout and lower levels of compassion satisfaction in medical professionals in radiation oncology. In this study, we aimed to assess the difference in professional quality of life (QoL) and the association with alexithymia in this multidisciplinary field depending on the specific profession (radiation/ clinical oncologist, RO; medical physicist, MP; radiation therapist, RTT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was conducted via an online questionnaire, receiving 1500 submissions between May and October 2018. Alexithymia was assessed via the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and professional QoL was evaluated using the Professional Quality of Life Scale (ProQoL) version 5. Comparisons between the RO, RTT, and MP groups were performed by ANOVA or MANOVA, followed by Bonferroni corrected ANOVAs for continuous variables, and Pearson's chi-square test for categorical variables. The effect size was determined by calculating partial eta-squared (eta2). RESULTS: Profession had a moderator role on the correlation between alexithymia and STS, with RO being at a higher risk than MP and RTT. Further, the results of this study demonstrate the relevant point prevalence of decreased well-being at work even for professional categories such as MP despite the more technical profile and reduced interaction with patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of alexithymia as a factor contributing to decreased professional QoL amongst radiation oncology professionals. Alexithymic ROs are impacted to a higher extent compared to MPs and RTTs by the indirect exposure to patients suffering. It is worth addressing these observations in professional education, aiming to improve QoL for healthcare personnel.",nocancer
"Sinapic acid (SA), a widely prevalent hydroxycinnamic acid, possess numerous biological activities owing to its antioxidant property. The present study was aimed to prepare colon targeted polysaccharidic/polymeric ester prodrug of SA (a microbially triggered system) using Leucaena leucocephala galactomannan (LLG) as a polysaccharidic carrier. The polymeric conjugates of SA-LLG were found to exhibit an increase in % yield and DS with increase in amount of SA and volume of thionyl chloride. The degree of depolymerization of SA-LLG prodrug batches were evaluated using optimized concentration of galactomannase. The SA-LLG prodrug was characterized employing UV and FTIR spectroscopy, 1H NMR and XRD. In vitro release study of the optimized prodrug batch (SL10) suggested stable nature of SA-LLG conjugate under acidic (pH 1.2) and alkaline conditions (pH 6.8). The treatment of prodrug with galactomannase (15 mg/mL) followed by esterase (10 U/mL) enzyme released approximately 81% of SA after 24 h. The cell viability results revealed that free SA and SA-LLG were found to have similar antiproliferative potential against human colon cancer cell lines (HCT-116 cells). Our investigation revealed that polysaccharidic prodrug, SA-LLG, has the potential for colon targeting of SA and thus can be employed for the treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs).",nocancer
"The human microbiome is a complex and dynamic ecosystem, and the imbalance of its microbial community structure from the normal state is termed dysbiosis. The dysbiotic gut microbiome has been proved to be related to several pathological conditions like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), Colorectal Cancer (CRC), etc., and several other extra-intestinal conditions like Type 1 & 2 diabetes, obesity, etc. The complex gut microbial ecosystem starts to build before the birth of an individual. It is known to get affected by several factors such as birth mode, individual lifestyle, dietary practices, medications, and antibiotics. A dysbiotic microbiome can potentially hamper host homeostasis due to its role in immune modulation, metabolism, nutrient synthesis, etc. Restoration of the dysbiotic gut microbiome has emerged as a promising aid and a better therapeutic approach. Several approaches have been investigated to achieve this goal, including prebiotics and probiotics, Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT), extracellular vesicles, immune modulation, microbial metabolites, dietary interventions, and phages. This review discusses the various factors that influence the human microbiome with respect to their cause-effect relationship and the effect of gut microbiome compositional changes on the brain through the gut-brain axis. We also discuss the practices used globally for gut microbiome restoration purposes, along with their effectiveness.",nocancer
"Jaboticaba, Plinia cauliflora (Mart.) Kausel, is a Brazilian berry traditionally used in folk medicine as treatment for some health conditions. Phenolic compounds such as flavonoids and anthocyanins have previously been detected in the fruit. This current study aimed to evaluate the toxicological effects of jaboticaba peel extract (JPE) on Artemia salina, L929, and MDA-MB-231 cell lines. Besides, JPE antioxidant, acetylcholinesterase, and antifungal activities, and elemental analysis CHNS were also tested. JPE had moderate toxicity (LD50 = 360.92 mug mL-1) on A. salina, non-toxic effect on L929 cell line, and decreased the viability of cancer cell line MDA at 1,000 microg mL-1 and 500 microg mL-1 concentrations. The antioxidant activity toward 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) performed IC50 = 37.45 +- 0.17 microg mL-1, whereas 45.7% of acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited. By its elemental composition, JPE is an alternative food supplement and dermocosmetic component. Antifungal potential toward Candida strains was not observed.",nocancer
"COVID-19 induced pandemic situations have put the bio-medical waste (BMW) management system, of the world, to test. Sudden influx, of COVID-infected patients, in health-care facilities, has increased the generation of yellow category BMW (Y-BMW) and put substantial burden on the BMW-incineration units of India. This study presents the compromising situation of the BMW-incineration units of India, in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, from 21st March 2020 to 31st August 2020. This analysis revealed that on an average each COVID-infected patient in India generates approximately 3.41 kg/d of BMW and average proportion of Y-BMW in it is 50.44%. Further, it was observed that on 13th July 2020, the total Y-BMW, generated by both the normal and COVID-infected patients, fully utilized the BMW-incineration capacity of India. Also, it was made evident that, during the study period, BMW-incineration emitted several pollutants and their concentration was in the order: NOx > CO > SOx > PM > HCl > Cd > Pb > Hg > PCBs > Ni > Cr > Be > As. Subsequently, life time cancer risk assessment depicted that with hazard quotient >10-6, Cd may induce carcinogenic health impacts on both the adults and children of India. Therefore, to mitigate the environmental-health impacts associated with the incineration of BMW, evaluation of various options, viz., alternative technologies, substitution of raw materials and separate treatment of specific wastes, was also done. It is expected that the findings of this study may encourage the global auditory comprising scientific community and authorities to adopt alternate BMW-management strategies during the pandemic.",nocancer
"The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-ARE transcriptional response pathway plays a critical role in protecting the cell from oxidative stresses via the upregulation of cytoprotective genes. Aberrant activation of Nrf2 in cancer cells can confer this cytoprotectivity, thereby reducing the efficacy of both chemotherapeutics and radiotherapies. Key to this antioxidant pathway is the interaction between Nrf2 and CREB binding protein (CBP), mediated by the Neh4 and Neh5 domains of Nrf2. Disruption of this interaction via small-molecule therapeutics could negate the effects of aberrant Nrf2 upregulation. Due to the disordered nature of these domains, there remains no three-dimensional structure of Neh4 or Neh5, making structure-based drug design a challenge. Here, we performed 48 mus of unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the Amber99SB*-ILDNP and CHARMM36m force fields and circular dichroism (CD) spectropolarimetry experiments to elucidate the free-state structures of these domains; no previous data regarding their conformational landscapes exists. There are two main findings: First, we find Neh5 to be markedly more disordered than Neh4, which has nine residues in the middle of the domain showing alpha-helical propensity, thus pointing to Neh4 and Neh5 having different binding mechanisms. Second, the two force fields show strong differences for the glutamic acid-rich Neh5 peptide but are in reasonable agreement for Neh4, which has no glutamic acid. The CHARMM36m force field agrees more closely with the CD results.",nocancer
"Ora-pro-nobis (Pereskia aculeata Miller) is a non-conventional food plant common in Brazil. The objective of this study was to optimize the extraction of bioactive phenolic compounds from ora-pro-nobis leaves by employing solvent mixtures. Ten extracts were obtained with water, ethanol, acetone, and their binary and ternary mixtures, evaluating the chemical composition, antioxidant activity and bioactivities in vitro. The response surface methodology was applied to model the results and calculate the optimal solvent composition, which is 60% water, 40% ethanol and 0% acetone. The optimized extract is rich in phenolic compounds (64 mg GAE/g) and proteins (823 mg/g) and presents antioxidant activity (in intracellular media as well) and inhibits lipid peroxidation (32%) along with hypotonic hemolysis (H50 = 0.339%), it does not present toxicity in vitro against cancer and normal cells.

"PURPOSE: To identify staff and participants perspectives of best practices that facilitate achieving enrollment and retention targets in biomedical cohort studies in Caribbean populations. METHODS: Eight focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with research stakeholders including research (i) nurses/study supervisors, (ii) field staff/data collectors, and (iii) rural and urban participants of the Third Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey (a national NCD risk factor survey with biospecimen collection) to capture qualitative data on experiences with recruitment, training, retention challenges and potential solutions or strategies for strengthening future efforts. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that trained, experienced study staff with good interpersonal communication skills enhanced the proficiency of field operations and attracted study participants. Targeted community and stakeholder engagement alongside strong support from the coordinating center increased the reach and efficiency of the data collectors. Timely participant feedback, gender-appropriate approaches, and socioeconomic balance enhanced equitable enrollment and retention of participants of cohort studies particularly the hard to reach groups. CONCLUSION: Well-functioning research teams using traditional and social media promotion, applying gender-appropriate and personalized approaches together with strategies for reaching the less accessible socioeconomic groups, are effective for recruiting and retaining members of a Caribbean cohort. These strategies may also enhance the recruitment of other Black populations in the Diaspora including the US and Caribbean into biomedical studies including cancer research.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To find out the moderating effect of emotion reactivity and several demographic variables following symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder among individuals having undergone an amputation. METHODS: The cross-sectional study was conducted from March to July 2015 at the Government College University, Lahore, Pakistan, and comprised individuals, enrolled from difference orthopaedic and rehabilitation centres, aged 18-60 years having undergone amputation of upper or lower limb either because of diseases, like diabetes, gangrene, cancer ulcer, or because of traumatic injuries, like road accident, electrical shock. Assessment of the study variables was done using the Emotion Reactivity Scale and the Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 160 subjects, 117(72%) were males and 43(28%) were females. The overall mean age was 38.45+-13.17 years. Upper limb amputation cases were 17(10.6%), lower limb 138(86.2%) and both upper and lower limb amputation 5(3.2%). Amputation due to any disease was the case with 76(47.5%) subjects, while traumatic injury was the cause in 84(52.5%). There was a significant positive association of emotional reactivity with symptoms severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Post-amputation effects were found to have a significant impact on individual emotions, and traumatic flashbacks had a leading role in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms severity.",nocancer
"Nanomaterial-based on-off-on fluorescence sensing strategies are significant particularly in intracellular nucleic acids imaging assay. There still remains challenge to rationally balance fluorescence quenching efficiency and recovery dynamics. We assume that the performance of on-off-on fluorescence sensing strategy can be fundamentally improved on small zero-dimensional (0D) nanomaterial with precisely modulated surface charge. For a proof-of-concept demonstration, silicon nanoparticle (SiNP) with ~4 nm was synthesized and used as the quencher model, of which the surface charge density was modulated by modification of triphenylphosphonium (TPP). The influence of particle size, surface charge and charge density of the nanomaterials on sensing performance was systematically investigated. The strategy showed a low limit of detection (LOD) as 26 pM for target model miR-494, which is one of the lowest in nanomaterial-based on-off-on sensing platforms. And the LOD is even comparable to amplification-based methods in a greatly shortened assay time (2.5 h). The miR-494 expresses in cancerous and normal living cells of human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), human lung carcinoma (A549), human breast cancer (MCF-7), and normal human mammary epithelial (MCF-10A) cells were imaged and localized with significantly improved sensitivity and specificity. These excellent performances insure it a promising candidate as convenient and non-enzymatic sensing platform for miRNA-associated disease detection and early diagnosis.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: After posterior fossa tumour surgery, up to 39% of children experience postoperative cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) characterized by mutism and other motor and cognitive impairments. There is a lack of knowledge on the patient-reported challenges and long-term needs. Consequently, no specific recommendations exist for rehabilitative and supportive interventions for patients with CMS. The aims of this study were to explore the patients' experiences related to the sequelae of CMS, to identify challenges and needs regarding support and rehabilitation in the period of growing from child to adult and to add perspectives for future developments of supportive care and rehabilitative guidelines. METHODS: Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with young adults diagnosed with CMS as children. A thematic analysis identified four themes describing challenges impacting aspects of the participants' lives. RESULTS: Four main themes were identified and highlight the rehabilitative need for focus on verbal and non-verbal communication skills in addition to the physical impairments. We found that brain tumour survivors with CMS can benefit from social and educational rehabilitation, straightforward and truthful information, support in structuring their everyday lives and increased public knowledge of CMS. CONCLUSION: Children with CMS face a variety of challenges affecting many aspects of their everyday lives. They should be entitled to the elements of a current rehabilitation initiative for childhood cancer to support patients' social disability and educational decline. Finally, we identified a need for an official information publication.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Irish Health Research Regulations (HRRs) were introduced following the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. The HRRs described specific supplementary regulatory requirements for research regarding governance, processes and procedure that impact on several facets of research. The numerous problems that the HRRs and particularly ""explicit consent"" inadvertently created were presented under the auspices of the Irish Academy of Medical Sciences (IAMS) on November 25, 2019, at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. AIMS: The objective of this review was to obtain feedback and to examine the impact of GDPR and the HRRs on health research in Ireland in order to determine whether the preliminary feedback, presented at the IAMS meetings, was reflected at a national level. METHODS: Individuals from the research community were invited to provide feedback on the impact, if any, of the HRRs on health research. Retrospective patient recruitment and consent outside a hospital setting for a multi-institutional Breast Predict study (funded by the Irish Cancer Society) were also analysed. RESULTS: Feedback replicated the issues presented at the IAMS with additional concerns identified. Only 20% of the original target population (n = 1987) could be included in the Breast Predict study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that the HRRs have had a significantly negative impact on health research in Ireland. Urgent meaningful engagement between patient advocate groups, the research community and legislators would help ameliorate these impacts.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: Economic constraints are a common explanation of why patients with low socioeconomic status tend to experience less access to medical care. We tested whether the decreased care extends to medical assistance in dying in a healthcare system with no direct economic constraints. DESIGN: Population-based case-control study of adults who died. SETTING: Ontario, Canada, between 1 June 2016 and 1 June 2019. PATIENTS: Patients receiving palliative care under universal insurance with no user fees. EXPOSURE: Patient's socioeconomic status identified using standardised quintiles. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Whether the patient received medical assistance in dying. RESULTS: A total of 50 096 palliative care patients died, of whom 920 received medical assistance in dying (cases) and 49 176 did not receive medical assistance in dying (controls). Medical assistance in dying was less frequent for patients with low socioeconomic status (166 of 11 008=1.5%) than for patients with high socioeconomic status (227 of 9277=2.4%). This equalled a 39% decreased odds of receiving medical assistance in dying associated with low socioeconomic status (OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.75, p<0.001). The relative decrease was evident across diverse patient groups and after adjusting for age, sex, home location, malignancy diagnosis, healthcare utilisation and overall frailty. The findings also replicated in a subgroup analysis that matched patients on responsible physician, a sensitivity analysis based on a different socioeconomic measure of low-income status and a confirmation study using a randomised survey design. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low socioeconomic status are less likely to receive medical assistance in dying under universal health insurance. An awareness of this imbalance may help in understanding patient decisions in less extreme clinical settings.",nocancer
"Alkaliptosis is a recently discovered form of regulated cell death driven by intracellular alkalization. However, the immune characteristics and mechanisms of alkaliptosis are still poorly understood. Here, we show that HMGB1, a multifunctional alarm protein that drives innate immunity, is necessary for inflammation caused by alkaliptotic damage. During alkaliptosis, HMGB1 translocation and release from the nucleus to the cytoplasm to the extracellular space requires nuclear DNA damage signals, whereas the FANCD2-dependent (but not ATM-mediated) DNA repair pathway inhibits this process. Once released by alkaliptotic cancer cells, extracellular HMGB1 binds to the AGER receptor in macrophages and then activates the STING1 pathway to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF and IL6). Consequently, the pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the HMGB1-AGER-STING1 pathway limits cytokine production during alkaliptosis. These findings provide new insight into the sterile inflammatory response to cell death.",nocancer
"Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes the loss of epithelial traits and gain of mesenchymal traits by normal cells during development and by neoplastic cells during cancer metastasis. The long noncoding RNA HOTAIR triggers EMT, in part by serving as a scaffold for PRC2 and thus promoting repressive histone H3K27 methylation. In addition to PRC2, HOTAIR interacts with the LSD1 lysine demethylase, an epigenetic regulator of cell fate during development and differentiation, but little is known about the role of LSD1 in HOTAIR function during EMT. Here, we show that HOTAIR requires its LSD1-interacting domain, but not its PRC2-interacting domain, to promote the migration of epithelial cells. This activity is suppressed by LSD1 overexpression. LSD1-HOTAIR interactions induce partial reprogramming of the epithelial transcriptome altering LSD1 distribution at promoter and enhancer regions. Thus, we uncover an unexpected role of HOTAIR in EMT as an LSD1 decommissioning factor, counteracting its activity in the control of epithelial identity.",nocancer

"A new biological scaffold was produced by replacing the 6pi-electron phenyl ring-B of a natural flavone skeleton with a 10pi-electron benzothiophene (BT). Since aromatic rings are important for ligand protein interactions, this expansion of the pi-electron system of ring-B might change the bioactivity profile. One of the resulting novel natural product-inspired compounds, 2-(benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)-5-hydroxy-7-isopropoxy-6-methoxyflavone (6), effectively arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase and displayed significant antiproliferative effects with IC50 values of 0.05-0.08 muM against multiple human tumor cell lines, including a multidrug resistant line. A structure-activity relationship study revealed that a 10pi-electron system with high aromaticity, juxtaposed 4-oxo and 5-hydroxy groups, and 7-alkoxy groups were important for potent antimitotic activity. Interestingly, two BT-flavonols (3-hydroxyflavone), 16 and 20, with 3-hydroxy and 5-alkoxy groups, induced distinct biological profiles affecting the cell cycle at the G1/S phase by inhibition of DNA replication through an interaction with topoisomerase I.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to elucidate the potential involvement of mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum contact genes in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease by monitoring levels of contact associated genes including Mitofusion 1 (MFN1) and MFN2, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), chaperone glucose-regulated protein 75 (GRP75), sigma non-opioid intracellular receptor 1 (SIGMAR1) and phosphate and tensin homolog induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) in human gingival fibroblasts in response to periodontal pathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis) in vitro. DESIGN: Primary human gingival fibroblasts were exposed to live cultures of P. gingivalis (W83; ATCC BAA-308) and F. nucleatum (subsp. Polymorphum; ATCC 10953) alone or in combination for 4 h at a 50 or 200 multiplicity of infection. Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (10 mug/mL) exposure was used as a positive control. Gene expression levels of contact genes (MFN1, MFN2, IP3R, GRP75, SIGMAR1 and PINK1) as well as a proinflammatory cytokine, Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and the apoptosis associated gene, Immediate early response 3 (IER3), were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: MFN1, GRP75, IP3R and PINK1 were significantly upregulated by P. gingivalis with or without F. nucleatum. Only P. gingivalis with F. nucleatum caused a significant upregulation of SIGMAR1. TNF-alpha and IER3 gene expression positively correlated with the contact-associated gene expression changes. CONCLUSION: F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis alone or in combination may differentially dysregulate the gene expression levels of contact-associated genes in human gingival fibroblasts. These host-microbiome interactions may mechanistically be important in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicated that females have a lower morbidity, severe cases rate, mortality and better outcome than those of male. However, it remained to be addressed why this was the case. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To find the factors that potentially protect females from COVID-19, we recruited all confirmed patients hospitalized at three branches of Tongji Hospital (n=1902) from January 28 to March 8, 2020, and analyzed the correlation between menstrual status (n=509,including 68 from Mobile Cabin Hospital)/female hormones (n=78)/ cytokines related to immunity and inflammation(n=263), and the severity/clinical outcomes in female patients under 60 years of age.Non-menopausal female patients had milder severity and better outcome compared with age-matched men (p<0.01/p<0.01). Menopausal patients had longer hospitalization times than non-menopausal patients ( hazard ratio [HR], 1.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.46,p= 0.033). Both anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and estradiol (E2) showed a negative correlation with severity of infection (AHR=0.146/0.304, 95%CI = [0.026-0.824]/[0.092-1.001], p=0.029/0.05). E2 levels were negatively correlated with IL-2R, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFalpha in luteal phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.592, -0.558, -0.545, -0.623; p=0.033, 0.048, 0.054, 0.023), and with C3 in follicular phase (Pearson Correlation=-0.651; p=0.030). CONCLUSION: Menopause is an independent risk factor for female COVID-19 patients. AMH and E2 are potential protective factors, negatively correlated with COVID-19's severity, among which E2 is attributed to its regulation of cytokines related to immunity and inflammation. Hormone supplement might be a potential therapy for COVID-19 patients.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Atrophic gastritis (AG) is one of the important precancerous lesions of gastric cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are closely related to AG susceptibility. However, the research conclusions on the predictive potential of SNPs are inconsistent. The study aims to retrospect the association between SNPs of whole genes and AG risk by meta-analysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Up to April 29, 2020, a systematic literature search for the relationship of SNPs with AG susceptibility was performed utilizing PubMed, Web of Science and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure. The overall and stratified meta-analyses on extracted data were conducted by Stata11.2. RESULTS: 33 case-control studies were enrolled containing 9951 AG patients and 17252 healthy controls, and 17 SNPs in 12 different genes were systematically reviewed. The results indicated that 12 genes could be categorized based on their function, including immune response, cell proliferation and apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. For the SNPs in immune response-related genes, the C allele of TLR1 rs4833095 T/C increased AG risk to 1.21-fold and the recessive model of TLR4 rs11536878 in the TLR gene family decreased AG susceptibility to 0.48-fold. The variant alleles of IL-10 rs1800871 (OR=1.21) and IL-8 rs4073 (OR=1.22) in the IL gene family were positively associated with AG risk. PSCA rs2294008 enhanced AG risk in all genetic models. SNPs associated with AG susceptibility were mainly focused on immune response-related genes. Conclusion These SNPs related to immune response could influence on AG risk and have potential to be AG predictive biomarkers. It is worth noting that the number of studies for each SNPs were insufficient due to the limited published researches and updated meta-analysis needs to be performed based on extensive relevant studies for more reliable results.",nocancer
"Mortality from COVID-19 has obscured a subtler crisis - the swelling ranks of COVID-19 survivors. After critical illness, patients often suffer post-intensive care syndrome (PICS), which encompasses physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that are often long-lasting barriers to resuming a meaningful life. Some deficits after COVID-19 critical illness will require otolaryngologic expertise for years after hospital discharge. There are roles for all subspecialties in preventing, diagnosing, or treating sequelae of COVID-19. Otolaryngologist leadership in multidisciplinary efforts ensures coordinated care. Timely tracheostomy, when indicated, may shorten the course of intensive care unit stay and thereby potentially reduce the impairments associated with PICS. Otolaryngologists can provide expertise in olfactory disorders; thrombotic sequelae of hearing loss and vertigo; and laryngotracheal injuries that impair speech, voice, swallowing, communication, and breathing. In the aftermath of severe COVID-19, otolaryngologists are poised to lead efforts in early identification and intervention for impairments affecting patients' quality of life.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) infection is a common health problem, which is closely related to peptic ulcers, gastric cancer, and extragastric diseases. Drugs can successfully eradicate it. However, the recurrence of H pylori often occurs after initial eradication. To confirm the global incidence of H pylori reinfection and systematically evaluate its risk factors. METHODS: We will search for the relevant literature through Chinese and English databases, with the retrieval deadline being November 2021. Databases include PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, Wanfang Database, and China Biomedical Literature Database. Stata14.0 will be used to conduct this systematic review. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocols statements are followed in this protocol, and the PRISMA statement will be followed in the completed systematic review. RESULTS: The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review will provide evidence regarding the rate of H pylori reinfection and its risk factors after successful eradication. It can guide the management of patients with H pylori infection.",nocancer
"Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue to preserve the fertility of girls and young women at high risk of sterility is now widely practiced. Pieces of cryopreserved ovarian cortex can be thawed and autografted to restore fertility, but because of the risks of reintroduction of the cancer, transplantation may not be possible for girls and women with blood-borne leukemias or cancers with a high risk of ovarian metastasis. Cryopreserved ovarian tissue contains mainly primordial follicles but also provides access to immature oocytes from small antral follicles, which may be matured in vitro to provide an additional source of mature oocytes. So in cases in which transplantation is contraindicated, fertility restoration could be safely achieved in the laboratory either by in vitro maturation (IVM) of oocytes aspirated from growing follicles or by the complete in vitro growth (IVG) and maturation (IVM) of primordial follicles to produce fertile metaphase II (MII) oocytes. The development of IVM and IVG methods to support all stages of oocytes available within ovarian tissue will maximize the potential for all patients undergoing fertility preservation.",nocancer
"Five new decalins, monalbidins A-E ( 1 , 2 and 7 - 9 ), together with 16 known compounds ( 3 - 6 and 10 - 21 ), were isolated from the EtOAc extract of marine derived fungus Monascus albidus BB3 cultured in GPY medium. Among the known compounds, 1-hydroxymonacolin L ( 11 ), dehydromonacolin J ( 15 ), 8- O -acetylmonacolin J ( 19 ) and O -acetylmonacolin K ( 21 ) were separated from natural sources for the first time.Their structures were determined by comprehensive analysis on the 1D and 2D NMR, HRESIMS, UV and IR data , and their absolute configurations were assigned by experimental and calculated ECD data, and X-ray single-crystal diffraction analysis. Monalbidins C and D ( 7 and 8 ), monacolin K methyl ester ( 13 ), dehydromonacolin L ( 14 ), dehydromonacolin K ( 16 ), monacolin K ( 20 ) and O -acetylmonacolin K ( 21 ) showed moderate cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines SUNE1, HepG2, QGY7701, HCT116 and MDA-MB-231.",nocancer
"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease that affects the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreatic islets. The non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse is a widely studied spontaneous model of the disease that has contributed greatly to our understanding of T1D pathogenesis. This is especially true in the case of antigen discovery. Upon review of existing knowledge concerning the antigens and peptide epitopes that are recognized by T cells in this model, good concordance is observed between mouse and human antigens. A fascinating recent illustration of the contribution of the NOD mouse in the area of epitope identification is the discovery of non-contiguous CD4+ T cell epitopes. This novel epitope class is characterized by the linkage of an insulin-derived peptide to, most commonly, a fragment of a natural cleavage product of another beta cell secretory granule constituent. These so-called hybrid insulin peptides (HIPs) are also recognized by T cells in T1D patients, though the precise mechanism for their generation has yet to be defined and is the subject of active investigation. While evidence from the tumor immunology arena documented the existence of non-contiguous CD8+ T cell epitopes, generated by proteasome-mediated peptide splicing involving transpeptidation, such CD8+ T cell epitopes were thought to be a rare immunological curiosity. However, recent advances in bioinformatics and mass spectrometry have challenged this view. These developments, coupled with the discovery of HIPs, have spurred a search for non-contiguous CD8+ T cell epitopes in T1D, an exciting frontier area still in its infancy.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: To explore the national inpatient trends, regional variations, associated diagnoses, and outcomes of vertebral augmentation (vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty) in the USA from 2004 to 2017. METHODS: Data from the National Inpatient Sample were used to study hospitalization records for percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty. Longitudinal projections of trends and outcomes, including mortality, post-procedural complications, length of stay, disposition, and total hospital charges were analyzed. RESULTS: Following a period of decreased utilization from 2008 to 2012, hospitalizations for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty plateaued after 2013. Total hospital charges and overall financial burden of hospitalizations for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty increased to a peak of $1.9 billion (range $1.7-$2.2 billion) in 2017. Overall, 8% of procedures were performed in patients with a history of malignancy. In multivariable modeling, lung cancer (adjusted OR (aOR) 2.6 (range 1.4-5.1)) and prostate cancer (aOR 3.4 (range 1.2-9.4)) were associated with a higher risk of mortality. The New England region had the lowest frequency of routine disposition (14.1+-1.1%) and the lowest average hospital charges ($47 885+-$1351). In contrast, 34.0+-0.8% had routine disposition in the West Central South region, and average hospital charges were as high as $99 836+-$2259 in the Pacific region. The Mountain region had the lowest number of procedures (5365+-272) and the highest mortality rate (1.2+-0.3%). CONCLUSION: National inpatient trends of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty utilization remained stable after a period of decline from 2008 to 2012, while the financial burden of hospitalizations increased. Despite recent improvements in outcomes, significant regional variations persisted across the USA.",nocancer
"SIRT7 is a NAD+ -dependent deacetylase that controls important aspects of metabolism, cancer, and bone formation. However, the molecular targets and functions of SIRT7 in the kidney are currently unknown. In silico analysis of kidney transcripts of the BXD murine genetic reference population revealed a positive correlation between Sirt7 and Slc12a7 mRNA expression, suggesting a link between the corresponding proteins that these transcripts encode, SIRT7, and the K-Cl cotransporter KCC4, respectively. Here, we find that protein levels and activity of heterologously expressed KCC4 are significantly modulated depending on its acetylation status in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Moreover, SIRT7 interacts with KCC4 in a NAD+ -dependent manner and increases its stability and activity in HEK293 cells. Interestingly, metabolic acidosis increases SIRT7 expression in kidney, as occurs with KCC4. In contrast, total SIRT7-deficient mice present lower KCC4 expression and an exacerbated metabolic acidosis than wild-type mice during an ammonium chloride challenge. Altogether, our data suggest that SIRT7 interacts with, stabilizes and modulates KCC4 activity through deacetylation, and reveals a novel role for SIRT7 in renal physiology.",nocancer
"Cadmium (Cd) is an important industrial and environmental pollutant, which is closely correlated with female infertility. Although Cd-induced developmental disorders of human ovarian follicles have been widely reported, the underlying mechanisms remain not fully elucidated. In this study, we explored the mechanism underlying Cd-triggered apoptosis in granulosa cells. Following the treatment with various levels of Cd (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 muM), we found that Cd triggered the death of KGN cells (a human granulosa-like tumor cell line) in a dose- as well as time-dependent manner. The levels of expressions of Bax and Bak were significantly increased, whereas the expression levels of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 were considerably decreased after being treated with high levels of Cd. We showed that Cd exposure remarkably triggered mitochondrial dysfunction, including increased intracellular ROS and free Ca2+ levels, and decreased ATP generation and mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, we found that mitochondrial dysfunction, especially excessive ROS production and intracellular Ca2+ overload, serve a vital role in Cd-triggered apoptosis of KGN cells. After using inhibitors to block the corresponding signaling cascades, Cd-mediated apoptosis was markedly repressed by ASK1 and p38 inhibitors in contrast with the control group. This suggests the activation of downstream pathways triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction participates in granulosa cell death and may cause female reproductive toxicity after Cd exposure.",nocancer
"Synthetic antibody (Ab) technologies are efficient and cost-effective platforms for the generation of monoclonal Abs against human antigens. Yet, they typically depend on purified proteins, which exclude integral membrane proteins that require the lipid bilayers to support their native structure and function. Here, we present an Ab discovery strategy, termed CellectSeq, for targeting integral membrane proteins on native cells in complex environment. As proof of concept, we targeted three transmembrane proteins linked to cancer, tetraspanin CD151, carbonic anhydrase 9, and integrin-alpha11. First, we performed in situ cell-based selections to enrich phage-displayed synthetic Ab pools for antigen-specific binders. Then, we designed next-generation sequencing procedures to explore Ab diversities and abundances. Finally, we developed motif-based scoring and sequencing error-filtering algorithms for the comprehensive interrogation of next-generation sequencing pools to identify Abs with high diversities and specificities, even at extremely low abundances, which are very difficult to identify using manual sampling or sequence abundances.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: It has been reported that long intergenic non-protein-coding RNA 324 (LINC00324) promotes liver cancer by upregulating Fas ligand (FasL), which is a major player in intervertebral disk degeneration (IDD), indicating the involvement of LINC00324 in IDD. This study was carried out to investigate the interaction between LINC00324 and FasL in IDD. METHODS: Plasma samples were collected from both IDD (n = 60) and healthy controls (n = 60). The expression of LINC00324 and FasL in plasma was determined by RT-qPCR. The interactions between LINC00324 and FasL in nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were analyzed by overexpression experiments. RESULTS: LINC00324 and FasL were upregulated in IDD patients, and they were positively correlated. After treatment, the expression levels of FasL and LINC00324 were significantly decreased. In NP cells, overexpression of LINC00324 increased the expression of FasL at both mRNA and protein levels, while overexpression of FasL did not affect the expression of LINC00324. CONCLUSION: LINC00324 may upregulate FasL in IDD to promote disease progression.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To evaluate image quality, image noise, and conspicuity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in pancreatic low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstructed using deep learning image reconstruction (DLIR) and compare with those of images reconstructed using hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR). METHODS: Our institutional review board approved this prospective study. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Twenty-eight consecutive patients with PDAC undergoing chemotherapy (14 men and 14 women; mean age, 68.4 years) underwent pancreatic LDCT for therapy evaluation. The LDCT images were reconstructed using 40% adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction-Veo (hybrid-IR) and DLIR at medium and high levels (DLIR-M and DLIR-H). The image noise, diagnostic acceptability, and conspicuity of PDAC were qualitatively assessed using a 5-point scale. CT numbers of the abdominal aorta, portal vein, pancreas, PDAC, background noise, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the anatomical structures, and tumor-to-pancreas contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were calculated. Qualitative and quantitative parameters were compared between the hybrid-IR, DLIR-M, and DLIR-H images. RESULTS: CT dose-index volumes and dose-length product in pancreatic LDCT were 2.3 +- 1.0 mGy and 74.9 +- 37.0 mGy cm, respectively. The image noise, diagnostic acceptability, and conspicuity of PDAC were significantly better in DLIR-H than those in hybrid-IR and DLIR-M (all P < 0.001). The background noise was significantly lower in the DLIR-H images (P < 0.001) and resulted in improved SNRs (P < 0.001) and CNR (P < 0.001) compared with those in the hybrid-IR and DLIR-M images. CONCLUSION: DLIR significantly reduced image noise and improved image quality in pancreatic LDCT images compared with hybrid-IR.",nocancer
"Compounds bearing thiazole and chalcone pharmacophores have been reported to possess excellent antitubercular and anticancer activities. In view of this, we designed, synthesized and characterized a novel series of thiazole-chalcone hybrids (1-20) and further evaluated them for antitubercular and antiproliferative activities by employing standard protocols. Among the twenty compounds, chalcones 12 and 7, containing 2,4-difluorophenyl and 2,4-dichlorophenyl groups, showed potential antitubercular activity higher than the standard pyrazinamide (MIC = 25.34 microM) with MICs of 2.43 and 4.41 microM, respectively. Chalcone 20 containing heteroaryl 2-thiazolyl moiety exhibited promising antiproliferative activity against the prostate cancer cell line (DU-145), higher than the standard methotrexate (IC50 = 11 +- 1 microM) with an IC50 value of 6.86 +- 1 microM. Furthermore, cytotoxicity studies of these compounds against normal human liver cell lines (L02) revealed that the target molecules were comparatively less selective against L02. Additional computational studies using AutoDock predicted the key binding interactions responsible for the activity and the SwissADME tool computed the in silico drug likeliness properties. The lead compounds generated through this study, create a way for the optimization and development of novel drugs against tuberculosis infections and prostate cancer.",nocancer
"Seventeen new amide/sulfonamide containing nimesulide derivatives were synthesized and characterized by several spectroscopic techniques and primarily investigated for their inhibitory potential on COX enzymes and other pro-inflammatory factors. Experimental analyses showed that among seventeen compounds, N8 and N10 have remarkable potency and selectivity for the COX-2 enzyme over COX-1 at very low doses as compared to nimesulide. Moreover, both N8 and N10 selectively reduced the Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated COX-2 mRNA expression level while the COX-1 level remained stable. Both PGE2 release and nitric oxide production in macrophage cells were significantly suppressed by the N8 and N10 treatment groups. In silico ADME/Tox, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were also conducted. Additionally, all compounds were also screened in a panel of cancer cell lines for their antiproliferative properties by MTT and SRB assays. Compound N17 exhibited a considerable antiproliferative effect on the colon (IC50: 9.24 muM) and breast (IC50: 11.35 muM) cancer cell lines. N17 exposure for 48 h decreased expression of anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 and increased the expression of apoptogenic BAX. Besides, the BAX/BCL-2 ratio was increased with visible ultrastructural changes and apoptotic bodies under scanning electron microscopy. In order to investigate the structural and dynamical properties of selected hits on the target structures, multiscale molecular modeling studies are also conducted. Our combined in silico and in vitro results suggest that N8 and N10 could be further developed as potential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), while cytotoxic N17 might be studied as a potential lead compound that could be developed as an anticancer agent.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Being diagnosed with dementia is a confronting experience for any individual and their caregiver. However, a diagnosis provides opportunity for future preparation for management of the condition. This study investigated attitudes toward dementia and preferences for diagnosis among a sample of health service consumers in Japan. METHODS: Participants were patients or accompanying support persons (n = 217) who visited the specialty outpatient clinic of four hospital departments. The survey was conducted using an iPad with answers sent automatically to a secure server. The survey included items about the participants' most feared diseases and the reasons behind those fears, estimates of dementia prevalence in Japan, and preferences regarding a diagnosis of dementia and the reasons for their preference. RESULTS: The most feared disease was cancer (43.8 %), followed by dementia (18 %). Those selecting dementia most commonly reported practical, emotional and social impacts as the reasons why they most feared this condition. Almost all participants preferred to know the diagnosis of dementia as soon as possible for themselves, with significantly fewer preferring their spouse to know as soon as possible if they had dementia (95.9 % for self vs. 67.5 % for partner/spouse, p < 0.001). On average, participants estimated that 18.1 % of Japanese people are diagnosed with dementia by age 65, while they thought that 43.7 % of Japanese people are diagnosed with dementia by age 85. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight a need for community education about the significant impacts of dementia on the lives of individuals and their caregivers. People were more reluctant for their spouse to receive a diagnosis as soon as possible if they had dementia. Physicians should sensitively disclose diagnosis and ensure they involve both the patient and their relatives in discussions about diagnosis disclosure.",nocancer
"Nucleases are powerful tools in various biomedical applications, such as genetic engineering, biosensing, and molecular diagnosis. However, the commonly used nucleases (endonuclease IV, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease-1, and lambda exonuclease) are prone to the nonspecific cleavage of single-stranded DNA, making the desired reactions extremely low-yield and unpredictable. Herein, we have developed guiding-strand-controlled nuclease systems and constructed theoretical kinetic models to explain their mechanisms of action. The models displayed excellent agreement with the experimental results, making the kinetics highly predictable and tunable. Our method inhibited the nonspecific cleavage of single-stranded probes while maintaining highly efficient cleavage of double-stranded DNA. We also demonstrated the clinical practicability of the method by detecting a low-frequency mutation in a genomic DNA sample extracted from the blood of a patient with cancer. The limit of detection could be 0.01% for PTEN rs121909219. We believe that our findings provide a powerful tool for the field and the established model provides us a deeper understanding of the enzymatic activities of DNA nucleases.",nocancer
"Capecitabine is a fluoropyrimidine that is widely used as a cancer drug for the treatment of patients with a variety of cancers. Unfortunately, early onset, severe or life-threatening toxicity is observed in 19-32% of patients treated with capecitabine and 5FU. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the degradation of 5FU and a DPD deficiency has been shown to be a major determinant of severe fluoropyrimidine-associated toxicity. DPD is encoded by the DPYD gene and some of the identified variants have been described to cause DPD deficiency. Preemptive screening for DPYD gene alterations enables the identification of DPD-deficient patients before administering fluoropyrimidines. In this article, we describe the application of upfront DPD screening in Finnish patients, as a part of daily clinical practice, which was based on a comprehensive DPYD gene analysis, measurements of enzyme activity and plasma uracil concentrations. Almost 8% of the patients (13 of 167 patients) presented with pathogenic DPYD variants causing DPD deficiency. The DPD deficiency in these patients was further confirmed via analysis of the DPD activity and plasma uracil levels. Interestingly, we identified a novel intragenic deletion in DPYD which includes exon 4 in four patients (31% of patients carrying a pathogenic variant). The high prevalence of the exon 4 deletion among Finnish patients highlights the importance of full-scale DPYD gene analysis. Based on the literature and our own experience, genotype preemptive screening should always be used to detect DPD-deficient patients before fluoropyrimidine therapy.",nocancer
"The ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 is a critical signaling molecule implicated in the functional maintenance and homeostasis of cells. Dysregulation of this process is involved in a variety of human diseases, including cancer. Therefore, NEDD8-activating enzyme E1 (NAE), the only activation enzyme of the neddylation pathway, has been an emergent anticancer target. In view of the single-agent modest response of the clinical NAE inhibitor, pevonedistat (compound 1, MLN4924), efforts on development of new inhibitors with both high potency and better safety profiles are urgently needed. Here, we report a structural hopping strategy by optimizing the central deazapurine framework and the solvent interaction region of compound 1, leading to compound 26 bearing a pyrimidotriazole scaffold.

This study shows that inflammatory neurological diseases were associated with increased levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, CXCL8, and CXCL10 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Conversely, encephalopathy was associated with high serum levels of IL-6, CXCL8, and active TGF-beta1. Inflammatory syndromes of the central nervous system (CNS) in COVID-19 can appear early, as a para-infectious process without significant systemic involvement, or without direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion.

"BACKGROUND: Improving the specific health checkups participation rate is an essential task nationwide; however, studies on measures to accomplish this are limited. This study aimed to examine the influence of ophthalmic checkups on the specific health checkups' participation rate. METHODS: We conducted a postal questionnaire survey on 1,741 countrywide municipalities in Japan from January to February 2019. The questionnaire specifically addressed health checkup participation rates of 2017, health checkups formats (group, individual, or both), simultaneous cancer screenings, simultaneous ophthalmic checkups, and the state of implementation of ophthalmic checkups. We used multiple linear regression analyses to calculate the partial regression coefficients (betas) and their 95% confidential intervals (CIs) to identify the influence of simultaneous ophthalmic checkups on specific health checkup participation rates. RESULTS: There was a significant association between specific health checkup participation rates and simultaneous ophthalmic checkups (beta: +2.5%; 95% CI, 1.3-3.8) after adjusting for covariates. The fundus photos of all applicants, fundus photos with restrictions, and ophthalmology consultation for all applicants were associated with a significant increase in the specific health checkup participation rate (beta: +2.8%, 95% CI, 1.2-4.4; beta: +2.0%, 95% CI, 0.2-3.9; beta: +7.4%, 95% CI, 1.2-13.6 respectively).

"PURPOSE: The use of mobile health technologies in the management of oral anticancer agents (OAA) can be beneficial in terms of treatment adherence and symptom management. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of a mobile application developed for patients using OAA on treatment adherence and symptom management. METHOD: The study was conducted using a randomized controlled trial design, and it was carried out on 77 patients. Data were collected from the Oral Chemotherapy Adherence Scale (OCAS), and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS). Data were collected at the beginning of the research, and face-to-face interviews were conducted after one, three, and six months. Patients in the intervention group were followed up for six months using the mobile application. RESULTS: It was found that there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in the baseline OCAS mean scores (p > 0.05), and the mean score of the intervention group increased over the first, third- and sixth-month measurements (p < 0.05). It was found that there was no difference between the intervention and control groups in the MSAS mean scores (p > .05), and there was a decrease in the mean MSAS score of the intervention group between the third- and sixth-month follow-up (p < .05). CONCLUSION: The present study results showed that the mobile application is effective in managing symptoms and increasing treatment adherence. A well-designed mobile health application that increases treatment adherence, decreases symptom severity, and supports patients' self-management could be beneficial for patients using OAA.

"The cytokine storm has been frequently reported to occur in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Data from the literature suggest that elevated levels of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor, indicate a severe course or the fatality of the disease. Several therapeutic options have been employed to treat critically ill patients, including hemoadsorption of inflammatory mediators. We here present a case of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by COVID-19 and acute renal failure. The patient was admitted to our intensive care unit and treated with mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and hemoadsorption to reduce the cytokine release syndrome, which plays a fundamental role in the clinical presentation of COVID-19 patients.

"The aberrant increase of circulating beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-HCG) at early stages of pregnancy can be used to predict gestational hypertension. However, the association of beta-HCG and inflammation, oxidative stress in pregnancy-caused hypertensive disorder on perinatal stage remains unclear. A case-controlled study was performed, with 133 adult pregnant women participated in their perinatal stage. Participants in this research included 45 with mild preeclampsia, 40 with severe preeclampsia and 48 without hypertension. Higher circulating beta-HCG level was correlated with severer pregnancy-induced hypertension. Independent contribution of inflammatory factors including interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma and oxidative stress factors including thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and total antioxidant capacity to severe pregnancy-induced hypertension was significant (p < 0.001).

"OBJECTIVE: This review assesses regenerative medicine of the upper aerodigestive tract during the first two decades of the twenty-first century, focusing on end-stage fibrosis and tissue loss in the upper airways, salivary system, oropharynx and tongue. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Medline and clinicaltrials.org were searched from 2000 to 2019. The keywords used were: bioengineering, regenerative medicine, tissue engineering, cell therapy, regenerative surgery, upper aerodigestive tract, pharynx, oropharynx, larynx, trachea, vocal cord, tongue and salivary glands. Original studies were subcategorised by anatomical region. Original human reports were further analysed. Articles on periodontology, ear, nose and maxillofacial disorders, and cancer immunotherapy were excluded. RESULTS: Of 716 relevant publications, 471 were original studies. There were 18 human studies included, within which 8 reported airway replacements, 5 concerned vocal fold regeneration and 3 concerned salivary gland regeneration. Techniques included cell transplantation, injection of biofactors, bioscaffolding and bioengineered laryngeal structures. CONCLUSION: Moderate experimental success was identified in the restoration of upper airway, vocal fold and salivary gland function.

"OBJECTIVE: The aim was to examine the impact of receipt of mental health services on health care expenditures for U.S. adults with major chronic physical conditions. METHODS: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data for 2004-2014 were analyzed for adults ages >18 with at least one of six chronic physical conditions (cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes, emphysema, asthma, and arthritis) who were followed up for 2 years (N=33,419). Outcomes included overall health care spending and expenditure by service type (inpatient services, outpatient services, emergency department visits, office-based physician visits, and prescribed medication). A difference-in-differences model compared a change in health care costs in the subsequent year for those who did and did not receive mental health services in the preceding year. RESULTS: On average, the increase in overall health care expenditure in the subsequent year among adults receiving mental health services in the preceding year was smaller by 12.6 percentage points (p<0.05) than for those who did not receive such services. The difference was equivalent to $1,146 in 2014 constant U.S. dollars (p=0.05). Medication treatment alone did not have a meaningful effect on overall costs. The combination of psychotherapy and medication was associated with a per-capita reduction in overall health care expenditure of 21.7 percentage points, or $2,690 (p<0.01). The combination was also associated with reduced costs for office-based visits (p<0.05) and medication (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Receipt of mental health services was associated with a reduction in overall health care costs, particularly for office-based visits and prescribed medication, among adults with chronic physical conditions.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Placenta accreta is one of the most serious complications in obstetrics and gynecology. Villous trophoblasts (VT) and extravillous trophoblasts (EVT) play a central role in normal placentation. Placenta accreta is characterized by abnormal invasion of EVT cells through the uterine layers, due to changes in several parameters, including adhesion proteins. Although alphavbeta3 integrin is a central adhesion molecule, participating in multiple invasive pathological conditions including cancer, data on placenta accreta are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To study the expression pattern of alphavbeta3 integrin in placenta accreta in comparison with normal placentas. STUDY DESIGN: We collected tissue samples from placentas defined as percreta, the most severe presentation of placenta accreta and from normal control placentas (n = 10 each). The samples underwent protein extractions for analyses of alphavbeta3 expression by Western blots (WB) and a parallel tissue assessment by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: WB results indicated significantly elevated alphavbeta3 integrin expression in the percreta samples compared to normal placentas. These elevated levels were mainly contributed by EVT cells, as demonstrated by IHC. alphavbeta3 integrin demonstrated a classical membranal expression in the VT cells, whereas a uniformly distributed expression was documented in the EVT cells. These patterns of the alphavbeta3 integrin localization were similar in both accreta and normal placental samples. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced alphavbeta3 integrin expression, mainly in extra villous trophoblasts of placenta percreta, implies for a role of this adhesion molecule in pathological placentation.",nocancer

"Vaccine hesitancy has increased in the past few years, influenced by the socio-cultural differences, political populism, or concerns related to the effectiveness and safety of some vaccines, resulting a feeling of distrust. This feeling can become a barrier against the achievement of the immunity necessary to stop the expansion of COVID-19. The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 in Spain, as well as to identify the factors that have an influence on the concerns and attitudes of people against accepting the vaccine in the months prior to the start of vaccination on December 2020. An online questionnaire was created to obtain information about (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) concerns and sources of information about vaccines; and (3) attitudes about vaccination and state of health. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the influencing factors. Of the 2501 participants, 1207 (48.3%) would accept the COVID-19 vaccine, 623 (24.9%) were hesitant, and 671 (26.8%) would reject it. The logistic regression showed that being male, older than 60, married, retired, with a high level of education, or with a leftist political inclination, could increase the probability of accepting the COVID-19 vaccine. Disinformation and the lack of political consensus were the main sources of distrust. The patients with hypertension, immunodepression, hypercholesterolemia, or respiratory disease, or were overweight, showed a greater acceptance to the vaccine, while those with cancer took the longest to accept it. A low acceptance of the vaccine against COVID-19 was observed among the Spanish population in the phase prior to its availability, and the main fears of the population were identified. It is necessary to offer correct and transparent information about these vaccines to reduce the concerns and increase the trust of the population, to thereby guarantee the success of the vaccination campaigns.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patient selection for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT), using comparative photon therapy planning, is workload-intensive and time-consuming. Pre-selection aims at avoidance of manual IMPT planning for patients that are in the end ineligible. We investigated the use of machine learning together with automated IMPT treatment planning for pre-selection of head and neck cancer patients, and validated the methodology for the Dutch model based selection (MBS) approach. MATERIALS & METHODS: For forty-five head and neck patients with a previous MBS, an IMPT plan was generated with non-clinical, fully-automated planning. Dosimetric differences of these plans with the corresponding previously generated photon plans, and the outcomes of the former MBS, were used to train a Gaussian naive Bayes classifier for MBS outcome prediction. During training, strong emphasis was placed on avoiding misclassification of IMPT eligible patients (i.e. false negatives). RESULTS: Pre-selection with the classifier resulted in 0 false negatives, 12 (27%) true negatives, 27 (60%) true positives, and only 6 (13%) false positive predictions. Using this pre-selection, the number of formal selection procedures with involved manual IMPT planning that resulted in a negative outcome could be reduced by 67%. CONCLUSION: With pre-selection, using machine learning and automated treatment planning, the percentage of patients with unnecessary manual IMPT planning for MBS could be drastically reduced, thereby saving costs, labor and time. With the developed approach, larger patient populations can be screened, and likely bias in pre-selection of patients can be mitigated by assisting the physician during patient pre-selection.",nocancer
"This study was designed to determine the occurrence, potential sources, human and ecological risks of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in soil from Wuhan, central China. The soil samples were collected from twenty-six sites at soil depth of 1-20 cm from three land-use types and analyzed for the presence of eight OCPs. The instrumental analysis was carried out using Gas Chromatography-Electron Capture Detector (GC-ECD). The obtained result ranged from 0.193 to 135.277 ng g-1 with the mean value of 17.337 ng g-1 for SigmaHCHs and 2.479 to 987.248 ng g-1 with the mean value of 80.056 ng g-1 for SigmaDDTs. The total sum (SigmaOCPs) ranged from 5.44 to 994.44 ng g-1 with the mean value of 97.39 ng g-1. p, p'- DDE was the highest OCP (976 ng g-1) detected in the soil followed by p, p'-DDD (287.454 ng g-1). Pearson correlation analysis indicated that there was a significant correlation between individual OCPs, while a weak and negative correlation between OCPs and selected soil properties. Isomeric ratio results indicated that DDTs in the soil came from historical (early use of DDTs) and HCHs originated from the use of lindane. Incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCR) indicated that HCHs can cause very low risk for adults while, low risks for children and DDTs can cause low risk on adults and high risks on children.",nocancer
"The interactions of proteins with drugs are very important from a pharmacological point of view. Holo-transferrin is a blood-plasma glycoprotein whose main function is iron-binding and the transport of other ligands. Additionally, the protein is only transferrin-form recognized by TfR1 and TfR2 receptors at the surface of rapidly proliferating malignant cells. Imatinib mesylate is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor mainly used in the treatment of blood cancers, frequently in multidrug therapy with cyclophosphamide. In this study the effect of cyclophosphamide on the interaction of imatinib mesylate with human holo-transferrin has been investigated. Using spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence, circular dichroism, ultraviolet-visible and electrophoretic light scattering additive parameters, system stability and the effect of the ligands on the protein conformation at varying pH values have been defined. Calculated quenching constants are in the order of 2 x 104 M-1 and the type of interaction depends on the reaction medium. Under physiological conditions binding constant is 1.329 x 106 M-1 whereas in an environment similar to that of cancer cells the constant is significantly lower, Ka = 6.060 x 104 M-1. N values are approximate to 1 in all cases. Moreover, some changes are observed in the alpha-helical structure of the protein after interaction with the drugs and the presence of cyclophosphamide slightly stabilizes the protein secondary structure. All collected data proves the effect of cyclophosphamide on the interaction between imatinib mesylate and human holo-transferrin. It is of great clinical interest due to anticancer, multidrug therapies including both imatinib mesylate and cyclophosphamide.",nocancer
"The challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic have intensified the stressors placed on nurses, leading to burnout. Oncology nurse burnout is likely to be an increasingly significant issue for cancer services as the true cost of the pandemic is revealed. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancers are reported widely, inevitably leading to poor prognosis and more aggressive treatments for patients. Gaining a better understanding of oncology nurse burnout, its prevalence and causes as well as strategies to reduce or prevent it will help to improve patient care and support staff wellbeing during and after the pandemic. Methodology: A search of the literature related to oncology nurse burnout, covering North America and Europe over 5 years (August 2014-January 2020), resulted in 31 articles for review. None of the studies were carried out in the UK, suggesting a need for robust investigations into oncology nurse burnout in the British health service. Summary: The prevalence of burnout among oncology nurses before the COVID-19 outbreak appeared to be high and is likely to have increased as a result of the pandemic. However, the studies investigating oncology nurse burnout are small and cross-sectional, with low-quality methods. The literature suggests the major causes of burnout arise in the workplace, particularly aspects of the environment that prevent nurses from working according to their values. Although burnout is frequently attributed to workplace factors, interventions remain focused on individuals' coping mechanisms and rarely on the workplace factors that are known to cause it.",nocancer
"Numerous experiments in vitro and in vivo have shown that an appropriate increase intake of silicon can facilitate the synthesis of collagen and its stabilization and promote the differentiation and mineralization of osteoblasts. In this study, we examined whether ortho-silicic acid restrains the differentiation of osteoclast through the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL)/receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB (RANK)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) signaling pathway by investigating its effect in vitro and in vivo. Bone marrow macrophage (BMM) cells were isolated and cultured with or without ortho-silicic acid, and then TRAP staining and immunofluorescence were performed to detect the differentiation of osteoclast. The RANKL-induced osteoclast marker gene and protein expression including c-Fos, nuclear factor of activated T cells cl (NFATcl), tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), nuclear factor kappa B P50 (NF-kappaB P50), NF-kappaB P52, RANK, integrin beta3, cathepsin K (CTSK), DC-STAMP, and TRAP were quantitatively detected by western blot and RT-PCR. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats were injected with ortho-silicic acid (OVX+Si group) and normal saline (OVX group), and sham-operated rats were injected with normal saline (Sham group). And micro-CT, H&E, and TRAP staining, ELISA, and western blot were performed. Ortho-silicic acid could inhibit the differentiation of osteoclast, and the marker genes and proteins were decreased. The OVX-induced bone loss could be reversed by ortho-silicic acid. Our finding demonstrated that ortho-silicic acid suppresses RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and has potential value as a therapeutic agent for OVX-induced bone loss.",nocancer
"The sustained use of intraoperative fluoroscopy has led to increased use of minimally invasive surgical techniques, enhanced surgeon proficiency, improved anatomic corrections, reduced patient morbidity, earlier functional recovery, and decreased length of hospital stay. As a result, orthopedic attending surgeons and residents are exposed to more radiation, increasing the risk of cancer and radiation-induced cataracts compared with the general population and those who work in other surgical specialties. The magnitude of radiation exposure depends on the susceptibility of the tissues affected, medical specialty, the position of the C-arm, distance from the radiation beam, level of difficulty of the surgical procedure, surgeon experience, level of resident training, and level of supervision by the attending surgeon. However, little information is available on the effect of supervision level on radiation exposure for orthopedic senior residents. The goal of this study was to investigate whether level of supervision by the attending surgeon affects the radiation exposure of orthopedic senior residents during surgical treatment of proximal femur fracture with cephalomedullary nail fixation. This retrospective cohort study was performed from January 2019 to March 2019. No significant relationship between supervision level and radiation exposure of senior residents was observed. Supervision level does not significantly affect radiation exposure for senior residents; therefore, the implementation of standardized training in radiation safety may be a more essential measure to decrease radiation exposure.

"AIM: Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory condition which causes pain, infertility, and predisposition for ovarian cancer. Endometriosis generates a unique microenvironment for survivability of endometriotic lesions which includes cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. For these cellular activities, cascading activations of intracellular kinases are needed. Many kinase signaling pathways, IKKbeta/NK-kappaB pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK), are activated in endometriosis. In this review, we focus on the role of MAPK pathways in endometriosis. METHODS: To identify the role of MAP Kinase signaling pathway in endometriosis we searched the Pubmed database using the search terms in various combinations ""endometriosis,"" ""endometrium,"" ""ovary,"" ""MAPK pathway,"" ""ERK pathway,"" ""p38 pathway,"" ""JNK pathway,"" ""estrogen,"" and ""progesterone."" RESULTS: According to the current literature, MAPK signaling pathway has various roles in generating microenvironment and survival of endometriosis. Abnormal MAPK activation in migration, implantation, growth, invasion into the pelvic structures, proliferation, and apoptosis leads to the form of endometriosis and to worsen the condition in patients with endometriosis. CONCLUSION: To further investigations on the effective and long-term endometriosis treatment, MAPK signaling pathways may be targeted. Molecular mechanism of MAPK signaling pathway in endometriosis should be more deeply understood and clinical trials should be more commonly performed for possible new endometriosis treatments to improve fertility and rescue endometriosis irreversibly.",nocancer
"Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) represent a common neurological pathology that determines a progressive deterioration of the brain or the nervous system. For treating NDs, comprehensive and alternative medicines have attracted scientific researchers' attention recently. Edible mushrooms are essential for preventing several age-based neuronal dysfunctions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Mushroom such as Grifola frondosa, Lignosus rhinocerotis, Hericium erinaceus, may improve cognitive functions. It has also been reported that edible mushrooms (basidiocarps/mycelia extracts or isolated bioactive compounds) may reduce beta-amyloid-induced neurotoxicity. Medicinal mushrooms are being used for novel and natural compounds that help modulate immune responses and possess anti-cancer, anti-microbial, and anti-oxidant properties. Compounds such as polyphenols, terpenoids, alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, polysaccharides, and metal chelating agents are validated in different ND treatments. This review aims to assess mushrooms' role and their biomolecules utilization for treating different kinds of NDs. The action mechanisms, presented here, including reducing oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and modulation of acetylcholinesterase activity, protecting neurons or stimulation, and regulating neurotrophins synthesis. We also provide background about neurodegenerative diseases and in-silico techniques of the drug research. High costs associated with experiments and current ethical law imply efficient alternatives with limited cost value. In silico approaches provide an alternative method with low cost that has been successfully implemented to cure ND disorders in recent days. We also describe the applications of computational procedures such as molecular docking, virtual high-throughput screening, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, quantum-mechanical methods for drug design. They were reported against various targets in NDs.",nocancer
"Comorbidity among people living with HIV (PLWH) is understudied although identifying its patterns and socio-demographic predictors would be beneficial for comorbidity management. Using electronic health records (EHR) data, 8,490 PLWH diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2016 in South Carolina were included in the current study. An initial list of 86 individual diagnoses of chronic conditions was extracted in the EHR data. After grouping individual diagnoses with a pathophysiological similarity, 24 diagnosis groups were generated. Hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to these 24 diagnosis groups and yielded four comorbidity clusters: ""substance use and mental disorder"" (e.g., alcohol use, depression, and illicit drug use); ""metabolic disorder"" (e.g., hypothyroidism, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease); ""liver disease and cancer"" (e.g., hepatitis B, chronic liver disease, and non-AIDS defining cancers); and ""cerebrovascular disease"" (e.g., stroke and dementia). Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to investigate the association between socio-demographic factors and multimorbidity (defined as concurrence of >= 2 comorbidity clusters). The multivariable logistic regression showed that age, gender, transmission risk, race, initial CD4 counts, and viral load were significant factors associated with multimorbidity. The results suggested the importance of integrated clinical care that addresses the complexities of multiple, and potentially interacting comorbidities among PLWH.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To evaluate the Siemens solution generating Synthetic computed tomography (sCT) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-only radiotherapy (RT). METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted on 47 patients treated with external beam RT for brain or prostate cancer who underwent both MRI and CT for treatment planning. sCT images were generated from MRI using automatic bulk densities segmentation. The geometric accuracy of the sCT was assessed by comparing the Hounsfield Units (HU) difference between sCT and CT for bone structures, soft-tissue, and full body contour. VMAT plans were computed on the CT for treatment preparation and then copied and recalculated with the same monitor units on the sCT using the AcurosXB algorithm. A 1%-1mm gamma analysis was performed and DVH metrics for the Planning Target Volume (PTV) like the Dmean  and the D98% were compared. In addition, we evaluate the usability of sCT for daily position verification with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for 14 prostate patients by comparing sCT/CBCT registration results to CT/CBCT. RESULTS: Mean HU differences were small except for the skull (207 HU) and right femoral head of four patients where significant aberrations were found. The mean gamma pass rate was 73.2% for the brain and 84.7% for the prostate and Dmean were smaller than 0.5%. Large differences for the D98% of the prostate group could be correlated to low Dice index of the PTV. The mean difference of translations and rotations were inferior to 3.5 mm and 0.2  in all directions with a major difference in the anterior-posterior direction. CONCLUSION: The performances of the software were shown to be similar to other sCT generation algorithms in terms of HU difference, dose comparison and daily image localization.",nocancer
"Endodontics is the branch of dentistry concerned with the morphology, physiology, and pathology of the human dental pulp and periradicular tissues. Human dental pulp is a highly dynamic tissue equipped with a network of resident immunocompetent cells that play major roles in the defense against pathogens and during tissue injury. However, the efficiency of these mechanisms during dental pulp inflammation (pulpitis) varies due to anatomical and physiological restrictions. Uncontrolled, excessive, or unresolved inflammation can lead to pulp tissue necrosis and subsequent bone infections called apical periodontitis. In most cases, pulpitis treatment consists of total pulp removal. Although this strategy has a good success rate, this treatment has some drawbacks (lack of defense mechanisms, loss of healing capacities, incomplete formation of the root in young patients). In a sizeable number of clinical situations, the decision to perform pulp extirpation and endodontic treatment is justifiable by the lack of therapeutic tools that could otherwise limit the immune/inflammatory process. In the past few decades, many studies have demonstrated that the resolution of acute inflammation is necessary to avoid the development of chronic inflammation and to promote repair or regeneration. This active process is orchestrated by Specialized Pro-resolving lipid Mediators (SPMs), including lipoxins, resolvins, protectins and maresins. Interestingly, SPMs do not have direct anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting or directly blocking this process but can actively reduce neutrophil infiltration into inflamed tissues, enhance efferocytosis and bacterial phagocytosis by monocytes and macrophages and simultaneously inhibit inflammatory cytokine production. Experimental clinical application of SPMs has shown promising result in a wide range of inflammatory diseases, such as renal fibrosis, cerebral ischemia, marginal periodontitis, and cancer; the potential of SPMs in endodontic therapy has recently been explored. In this review, our objective was to analyze the involvement and potential use of SPMs in endodontic therapies with an emphasis on SPM delivery systems to effectively administer SPMs into the dental pulp space.",nocancer
"Light activatable porphyrinic photosensitizers (PSs) are essential components of anticancer and antimicrobial therapy and diagnostic imaging. However, their biological applications are quite challenging due to the lack of hydrophilicity and biocompatibility. To overcome such drawbacks, photosensitizers can be doped into a biocompatible polymer such as gelatin and further can be used for biomedical applications. Herein, first, a novel A4 type porphyrin PS [5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-pyridylamidephenyl)porphyrin; TPyAPP] was synthesized via a rational route with good yield. Further, this porphyrin was encapsulated into the gelatin nanoparticles (GNPs) to develop hydrophilic phototherapeutic nanoagents (PTNAs, A4por-GNPs). Notably, the synthesis of such porphyrin-doped GNPs avoids the use of any toxic chemicals or solvents. The nanoprobes have also shown good fluorescence quantum yield demonstrating their applicability in bioimaging. Further, the mechanistic aspects of the anticancer and antimicrobial efficacy of the developed A4por-GNPs were evaluated via singlet oxygen generation studies. Overall, our results indicated porphyrin-doped biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles act as effective phototherapeutic agents against a broad range of cancer cell lines and microbes upon activation by the low-cost LED light.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of hospital admissions and associated mortality rates for non-covid medical conditions during the covid-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Nationwide, population based cohort study. SETTING: Denmark from 13 March 2019 to 27 January 2021. PARTICIPANTS: All Danish residents >1 year of age. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Population based healthcare registries that encompass the entire Danish population were used to compare hospital admission and mortality rates during the covid-19 pandemic (from 11 March 2020 to 27 January 2021) with the prepandemic baseline data (from 13 March 2019 to 10 March 2020). Hospital admissions were categorised as covid-19 when patients were assigned a diagnosis code for covid-19 within five days of admission. All patients were followed until migration, death, or end of follow-up, whichever came first. Rate ratios for hospital admissions were computed using Poisson regression and were directly standardised using the Danish population on 1 January 2019 as reference. 30 day mortality rate ratios were examined by Cox regression, adjusted for age and sex, and covid-19 diagnosis was used as a competing risk. RESULTS: 5 753 179 residents were identified during 567.8 million person weeks of observation, with 1 113 705 hospital admissions among 675 447 people. Compared with the prepandemic baseline period (mean hospital admission rate 204.1 per 100 000/week), the overall hospital admission rate for non-covid-19 conditions decreased to 142.8 per 100 000/week (rate ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.66 to 0.74) after the first national lockdown, followed by a gradual return to baseline levels until the second national lockdown when it decreased to 158.3 per 100 000/week (0.78, 0.73 to 0.82). This pattern was mirrored for most major diagnosis groups except for non-covid-19 respiratory diseases, nervous system diseases, cancer, heart failure, sepsis, and non-covid-19 respiratory infections, which remained lower throughout the study period. Overall 30 day mortality rates were higher during the first national lockdown (mortality rate ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 1.32) and the second national lockdown (1.20, 1.16 to 1.24), and these results were similar across most major diagnosis groups. For non-covid-19 respiratory diseases, cancer, pneumonia, and sepsis, the 30 day mortality rate ratios were also higher between lockdown periods. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital admissions for all major non-covid-19 disease groups decreased during national lockdowns compared with the prepandemic baseline period. Additionally, mortality rates were higher overall and for patients admitted to hospital with conditions such as respiratory diseases, cancer, pneumonia, and sepsis. Increased attention towards management of serious non-covid-19 medical conditions is warranted.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To compare lesion features extracted from 18F-FDG PET/CT images acquired on analog and digital scanners, on consecutive imaging data from the same subjects. METHODS: Whole-body 18F-FDG PET/CT images from 55 oncological patients were acquired twice after a single 18F-FDG injection, with a digital and an analog PET/CT scanner, alternately. Twenty-nine subjects were examined first on the digital, and 26 first on the analog equipment. Image reconstruction was performed using manufacturer standard clinical protocols and protocols that fulfilled EARL1 specifications. Twenty-five features based on lesion standardized uptake value (SUV) and geometry were assessed. To compare these features, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), relative difference (RD), absolute value of RD ( RD ), and repeatability coefficient (RC) were used. RESULTS: In total, 323 18F-FDG avid lesions were identified. High agreement (ICC > 0.75) was obtained for most of the lesion features pulled out from both scanners' imaging data, especially when reconstruction protocols fulfilled EARL1 specifications. For EARL1 reconstruction images, the features frequently used in clinics, SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume, and total lesion glycolysis, reached an ICC of 0.92, 0.95, 0.87, 0.98, and 0.98, and a median RD (digital-analog) of 3%, 5%, 4%, - 3% and 1%, respectively. Using standard reconstruction protocols, the ICC were 0.84, 0.93, 0.80, 0.98, and 0.98, and the RD were 20%, 11%, 13%, - 7%, and 7%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Under controlled acquisition and reconstruction parameters, most of the features studied can be used for research and clinical work. This is especially important for multicenter studies and patient follow-ups. KEY POINTS:   Using manufacturer standard clinical reconstruction protocols, lesions SUV was significantly higher when using the digital scanner, especially the SUVmax that was approximately 20% higher.   High agreement was obtained for the majority of the lesion features when using reconstruction protocols that fulfilled EARL1 specifications.   Longitudinal patient studies can be performed interchangeably between digital and analog scanners when both fulfill EARL1 specifications.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: Representing the largest proportion of health care workers, nurses play a significant role in oral health (OH) maintenance as part of a larger effort to promote holistic patient care. The study aims to determine nursing students' perceptions of OH education and practice in Malaysian and Australian nursing schools. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A self-administered questionnaire (content- and face-validated) survey was undertaken, classroom style, amongst final-year nursing students from selected Malaysian (n=122,Response rate=97.6%) and Australian (n=299,Response rate=54.7%) institutions. Quantitative data was analysed via Statistical Package for Social Science software (Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests, P<=0.01). RESULTS: Significantly more Malaysian nursing students, compared to those in Australia, reported having encountered patients with OH issues (98.4% vs. 82.9%), namely halitosis (87.7% vs. 62.2%), oral ulcers (63.1% vs. 41.1%), oral/dental trauma (36.9% vs. 21.1%) and caries in children (28.7% vs. 7.7%). Less than half of Malaysian and Australian nursing students reported that they received adequate OH training (48.4% vs. 36.6%, p<=0.01), especially in detecting oral cancer (18.0.0% vs. 22.6%, p<=0.01) and preventing oral diseases (46.7% vs. 41.7%, p<=0.01). Students in both countries demonstrated positive attitudes and believed in their role in OH care. Most students agreed that they should receive training in OH, especially in smoking cessation and providing OH care for patients with special needs. They also opined that a standardised evidence-based oral hygiene protocol is needed. CONCLUSION: Support for education and practice in this area of patient care suggested positive implications for further development of nurses' roles in OH promotion and management.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: : Neurotensin is a gut-brain peptide hormone, a 13 amino acid neuropeptide found in the central nervous system and in the GI tract. The neurotensinergic system is implicated in various physiological and pathological processes related to neuropsychiatric and metabolic machineries, cancer growth, food and drug intake. NT mediates its functions through its two G protein coupled receptors: neurotensin receptor 1 (NTS1/NTSR1) and neurotensin receptor 2 (NTS2/NTSR2). Over the past decade, the role of NTS3/NTSR3/sortilin has also gained importance in human pathologies. Several approaches have appeared dealing with the discovery of compounds able to modulate the functions of this neuropeptide through its receptors for therapeutic gain. AREAS COVERED: The article provides an overview of over four decades of research and details the drug discovery approaches and patented strategies targeting NTSR in the past decade. EXPERT OPINION: Neurotensin is an important neurotransmitter that enables crosstalk with various neurotransmitter and neuroendocrine systems. While significant efforts have been made that have led to selective agonists and antagonists with promising in vitro and in vivo activities, the therapeutic potential of compounds targeting the neurotensinergic system is still to be fully harnessed for successful clinical translation of compounds for the treatment of several pathologies.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Urethrovaginal fistula (UVF) is a rare disorder, which implies the presence of an abnormal communication between the urethra and the vagina. METHODS: Surgical repair options include transurethral, transabdominal and transvaginal procedures, either with or without tissue interposition. The vaginal route is considered a safe and effective option to correct UVF. This video is aimed to present a case of direct transvaginal layered repair of urethrovaginal fistula, without the use of tissue interposition. The featured patient is a 66-year-old woman who developed a symptomatic UVF after a complicated laparoscopic hysterectomy for endometrial cancer 3 years before. Cystoscopy demonstrated the presence of a 7 mm urethral orifice a few millimeters caudal from the bladder neck. After proper informed consent, the patient was admitted to transvaginal primary layered repair, according to the technique demonstrated in the video. The featured procedure was completed in 60 min and blood loss was < 100 ml. No surgical complications were observed. RESULTS: The procedure was successful in restoring the anatomy and relieving the symptoms. CONCLUSION: Transvaginal layered repair without tissue interposition represents a safe and effective procedure for the surgical management of postsurgical urethrovaginal fistula.",nocancer

"OBJECTIVE: Patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) need expert palliative care at the end of life. In the U.S., hospice may provide this care, but few patients enroll and information about hospice experience with LVAD-implanted patients is limited. AIM: To describe hospice experience with LVAD-implanted patients. METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study of all LVAD-implanted patients admitted to a hospice agency. Data were extracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS: The 13 patients had a mean age of 63 years (range 20 to 89) and a mean LVAD duration of 32.5 months (range 8.2 to 70.0). Hospice diagnosis was heart failure in 10 patients and cancer in 3; all patients were multimorbid. Eight patients enrolled in hospice on one occasion, four had two enrollments, and one had five. All patients received services for <180 days, three for <7 days and four patients for >90 days. Just-in-time in-servicing was used to prepare hospice teams for challenging care needs, including bleeding, delirium, infections and mechanical failure. Of the nine patients who died while receiving hospice services, one enrolled with a plan to deactivate the LVAD immediately after hospice enrollment and six died following discontinuation of the LVAD or other life-sustaining therapy during the course of hospice care. Five deaths occurred in a hospice inpatient unit. CONCLUSION: To provide specialist palliative care to LVAD-implanted patients, hospices must be prepared to manage complex and highly varied needs. To do this, hospices must have adequate staff support and access to acute care.",nocancer
"Purpose: The study investigates the regulatory effects exhibited by lysate of Lactobacillus sakei pro-Bio65 (4%; L.SK) on the human conjunctival epithelial (HCE) cell line. Methods: Trypan blue and methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) methods were used to assess cell growth and viability. Mitochondrial membrane potential was assessed by JC-1 staining and cytofluorimetric detection methods. The antioxidant pattern and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed by spectrophotometric and spectrofluorimetric methods. NF-kappaB luciferase activity was quantified by luminometric detection. NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, as well as mitochondrial morphology, were investigated by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. Cytokines and COX2 expression levels were determined by Western blot analyses. Results: This study demonstrates that L.SK exposure does not influence HCE cell proliferation and viability in vitro. L.SK paraprobiotic induces mild-low levels of intracellular ROS. It is coupled to changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), in a context of a regular mitochondrial-network organization. The negative modulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) expression levels and rising antioxidant defense efficiency, mediated by the upregulation of glutathione (GSH) and increased antioxidant enzymatic activities, were observed. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that L.SK empowers the antioxidant endogenous efficiency of HCE cells, by the upregulation of the GSH content and the enzymatic antioxidant pattern, and concurrently reduces TNF-alpha protein expression. Translational Relevance: Although the obtained in vitro results should be confirmed by in vivo investigations, our data suggest the possibility of L.SK paraprobiotic application for promoting eye health, exploring its use as an endogen antioxidant system inducer in preventing and treating different oxidative stress-based, inflammatory, and age-related conditions.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: The efficacy of the novel interleukin (IL)-23p19 inhibitor guselkumab for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has recently been demonstrated in two phase 3 trials (DISCOVER-1 & -2) but has not been evaluated vs other targeted therapies for PsA. The objective was to compare guselkumab to targeted therapies for PsA for safety and joint and skin efficacy through network meta-analysis (NMA). METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in January 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials. Bayesian NMAs were performed to compare treatments on American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 response, mean change from baseline in van der Heijde-Sharp (vdH-S) score, Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75/90/100 response, adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). RESULTS: Twenty-six phase 3 studies evaluating 13 targeted therapies for PsA were included. For ACR 20 response, guselkumab 100 mg every 8 weeks (Q8W) was comparable to IL-17A inhibitors and subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors. Similar findings were observed for ACR 50 and 70. For vdH-S score, guselkumab Q8W was comparable to other agents except intravenous TNF therapies. Results for PASI 75 and PASI 90 response suggested guselkumab Q8W was better than most other agents. For PASI 100, guselkumab Q8W was comparable to other active agents. For AEs and SAEs, guselkumab Q8W ranked highly but comparative conclusions were uncertain. Similar results were observed for all outcomes for guselkumab 100 mg every four weeks. CONCLUSIONS: In this NMA, guselkumab demonstrated favorable arthritis efficacy comparable to IL-17A and subcutaneous TNF inhibitors while offering better PASI response relative to many other treatments.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune disorders have become increasingly acknowledged as having a more causative role in encephalitis than previously assumed. Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis seems to be the most prevalent disorder. Symptoms of the neuropsychiatric phase in children and adolescents include abnormal behavior, seizures, and neurologic symptoms. We present a report on a teenage girl with predominantly psychiatric symptoms, highlighting the need for awareness of the disease and multidisciplinary collaboration. CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient, a 17-year-old girl of Middle Eastern origin, had no earlier medical history, but a family history of autoimmune disease. One morning, she could not recognize her mother and soon developed increased energy and pressured speech. The condition worsened, with paranoid delusions. In the emergency unit, she ran around speaking incoherently. The condition was interpreted as a full-scale mania. After pediatric clearance, the patient was admitted to the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Mood-stabilizing treatment was initiated with second-generation psychotics and lithium, but this brought no improvement. A multidisciplinary discussion was held with physicians from psychiatry and neurology. A lumbar puncture showed N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibodies, and autoimmune treatment was initiated. Computed tomography thorax/abdomen revealed a right-sided ovarian tumor. After salpingo-oophorectomy, our patient's mental status gradually improved, as demonstrated by repeated testing. Seven months post discharge she was in a stable relationship and performing well in school. CONCLUSION: This case underlines the importance of collaboration between child and adolescent psychiatry and pediatrics, and gives pointers for timely diagnosis. Manic adolescents who do not respond to mood-stabilizing treatment should be subjected to further consultations and investigations. Psychiatrists and neurologists should develop an integrated approach to the management of brain disorders.",nocancer
"Clinical tests based on whole-genome sequencing are generally focused on a single task approach, testing one or several parameters, although whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides us with large data sets that can be used for many supportive analyses. In spite of low genome coverage, data of WGS-based non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) contain fully sequenced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This mtDNA can be used for variant calling, ancestry analysis, population studies and other approaches that extend NIPT functionality. In this study, we analyse mtDNA pool from 645 cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples of pregnant women from different regions of Russia, explore the effects of transportation and storing conditions on mtDNA content, analyse effects, frequency and location of mitochondrial variants called from samples and perform haplogroup analysis, revealing the most common mitochondrial superclades. We have shown that, despite the relatively low sequencing depth of unamplified mtDNA from cfDNA samples, the mtDNA analysis in these samples is still an informative instrument suitable for research and screening purposes.",nocancer
"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes a hyperglycemic status which leads, over time, to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most frequent form of diabetes is type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which is often part of a metabolic syndrome (hyperglycaemia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal obesity) that usually requires the use of several medications from different drug classes to bring each of these conditions under control. T2DM is associated with an increase in inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Higher levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha are associated with a downregulation of several drug metabolizing enzymes, especially the cytochrome P450 (P450) isoforms CYP3As and CYP2C19. A decrease in these P450 isoenzymes may lead to unexpected rise in plasma levels of substrates of these enzymes. It could also give rise to a mismatch between the genotypes determined for these enzymes, the predicted phenotypes based on these genotypes and the phenotypes observed clinically. This phenomenon is described as phenoconversion. Phenoconversion typically results from either a disease (such as T2DM) or concomitant administration of medications inducing or inhibiting (including competitive or non-competitive inhibition) a P450 isoenzyme used by other substrates for their elimination. Phenoconversion could have a significant impact on drug effects and genotypic-focused clinical outcomes. As the aging population is exposed to polypharmacy along with inflammatory comorbidities, consideration of phenoconversion related to drug metabolizing enzymes is of importance when applying pharmacogenomic results and establishing personalized and more precise drug regimens.",nocancer
"The use of insects as a feasible and useful natural product resource is a novel and promising option in alternative medicine. Several components from insects and their larvae have been found to inhibit molecular pathways in different stages of cancer. This study aimed to analyze the effect of aqueous and alcoholic extracts of Vespa orientalis larvae on breast cancer MCF7 cells and investigate the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that individual treatment with 5% aqueous or alcoholic larval extract inhibited MCF7 proliferation but had no cytotoxic effect on normal Vero cells. The anticancer effect was mediated through (1) induction of apoptosis, as indicated by increased expression of apoptotic genes (Bax, caspase3, and p53) and decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl2; (2) suppression of intracellular reactive oxygen species; (3) elevation of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, and GPx) and upregulation of the antioxidant regulator Nrf2 and its downstream target HO-1; (4) inhibition of migration as revealed by in vitro wound healing assay and downregulation of the migration-related gene MMP9 and upregulation of the anti-migratory gene TIMP1; and (5) downregulation of inflammation-related genes (NFkappaB and IL8). The aqueous extract exhibited the best anticancer effect with higher antioxidant activities but lower anti-inflammatory properties than the alcoholic extract. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of several flavonoids and phenolic compounds with highest concentrations for resveratrol and naringenin in aqueous extract and rosmarinic acid in alcoholic extract. This is the first report to explain the intracellular pathway by which flavonoids and phenolic compounds-rich extracts of Vespa orientalis larvae could induce MCF7 cell viability loss through the initiation of apoptosis, activation of antioxidants, and inhibition of migration and inflammation. Therefore, these extracts could be used as adjuvants for anticancer drugs and as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agents.",nocancer
"Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) is a popular thermoplastic material widely used in engineering applications due to its favorable mechanical properties and stability at high temperatures. With the first implantable grade PEEK being commercialized in 1990s, the use of PEEK has since grown exponentially in the biomedical field and has rapidly transformed a large section of the medical devices landscape. Nowadays, PEEK is a standard biomaterial used across a wide range of implant applications, however, its bioinertness remains a limitation for bone repair applications. The increasing demand for enhanced treatment efficacy/improved patient quality of life, calls for next-generation implants that can offer fast bone integration as well as other desirable therapeutic functions. As such, modification of PEEK implants has progressively shifted from offering desirable mechanical properties, enhancing bioactivity/fast osteointegration, to more recently, tackling post-surgery bacterial infection/biofilm formation, modulation of inflammation and management of bone cancers. Such progress is also accompanied by the evolution of the PEEK manufacturing technologies, to meet the ever increasing demand for more patient specific devices. However, no review has comprehensively covered the recently engaged application areas to date. This paper provides an up-to-date review on the development of PEEK-based biomedical devices in the past 10 years, with particularly focus on modifying PEEK for multi-modal therapeutics. The aim is to provide the peers with a timely update, which may guide and inspire the research and development of next generation PEEK-based healthcare products. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: : Significant progress has been made in PEEK processing and modification techniques in the past decades, which greatly contributed to its wide applications in the biomedical field. Despite the high volume of published literature on PEEK implant related research, there is a lack of review on its emerging applications in multi-modal therapeutics, which involve bone regeneration, anti-bacteria/anti-inflammation, and cancer inhibition, etc. This timely review covers the state-of-the-art in these exciting areas and provides the important guidance for next generation PEEK based biomedical device research and development.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Routinely collected electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to enhance randomised controlled trials (RCTs) by facilitating recruitment and follow-up. Despite this, current EHR use is minimal in UK RCTs, in part due to ongoing concerns about the utility (reliability, completeness, accuracy) and accessibility of the data. The aim of this manuscript is to document the process, timelines and challenges of the application process to help improve the service both for the applicants and data holders. METHODS: This is a qualitative paper providing a descriptive narrative from one UK clinical trials unit (MRC CTU at UCL) on the experience of two trial teams' application process to access data from three large English national datasets: National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS), National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research (NICOR) and NHS Digital to establish themes for discussion. The underpinning reason for applying for the data was to compare EHRs with data collected through case report forms in two RCTs, Add-Aspirin (ISRCTN 74358648) and PATCH (ISRCTN 70406718). RESULTS: The Add-Aspirin trial, which had a pre-planned embedded sub-study to assess EHR, received data from NCRAS 13 months after the first application. In the PATCH trial, the decision to request data was made whilst the trial was recruiting. The study received data after 8 months from NICOR and 15 months for NHS Digital following final application submission. This concluded in May 2020. Prior to application submission, significant time and effort was needed particularly in relation to the PATCH trial where negotiations over consent and data linkage took many years. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience demonstrates that data access can be a prolonged and complex process. This is compounded if multiple data sources are required for the same project. This needs to be factored in when planning to use EHR within RCTs and is best considered prior to conception of the trial. Data holders and researchers are endeavouring to simplify and streamline the application process so that the potential of EHR can be realised for clinical trials.",nocancer
"Nanomedicine is seen as a potential central player in the delivery of personalized medicine. Biocompatibility issues of nanoparticles have largely been resolved over the past decade. Despite their tremendous progress, less than 1% of applied nanosystems can hit their intended target location, such as a solid tumor, and this remains an obstacle to their full ability and potential with a high translational value. Therefore, achieving immune-tolerable, blood-compatible, and biofriendly nanoparticles remains an unmet need. The translational success of nanoformulations from bench to bedside involves a thorough assessment of their design, compatibility beyond cytotoxicity such as immune toxicity, blood compatibility, and immune-mediated destruction/rejection/clearance profile. Here, we report a one-pot process-engineered synthesis of ultrasmall gold nanoparticles (uGNPs) suitable for better body and renal clearance delivery of their payloads. We have obtained uGNP sizes of as low as 3 nm and have engineered the synthesis to allow them to be accurately sized (almost nanometer by nanometer). The synthesized uGNPs are biocompatible and can easily be functionalized to carry drugs, peptides, antibodies, and other therapeutic molecules. We have performed in vitro cell viability assays, immunotoxicity assays, inflammatory cytokine analysis, a complement activation study, and blood coagulation studies with the uGNPs to confirm their safety. These can help to set up a long-term safety-benefit framework of experimentation to reveal whether any designed nanoparticles are immune-tolerable and can be used as payload carriers for next-generation vaccines, chemotherapeutic drugs, and theranostic agents with better body clearance ability and deep tissue penetration.",nocancer
"GATA2 deficiency is a bone marrow failure syndrome effectively treated with hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which also addresses the predisposition to many infections (prominently mycobacterial). However, many GATA2-deficient persons who come to HCT also have prevalent and refractory human papilloma virus disease (HPVD), which can be a precursor to cancer. We analyzed 75 HCT recipients for the presence of HPVD to identify patient characteristics and transplantation results that influence HPVD outcomes. We assessed the impact of cellular recovery and iatrogenic post-transplantation immunosuppression, as per protocol (PP) or intensified/prolonged (IP) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis or treatment, on the persistence or resolution of HPVD. Our experience with 75 HCT recipients showed a prevalence of 49% with anogenital HPVD, which was either a contributing or primary factor in the decision to proceed to HCT. Of 24 recipients with sufficient follow-up, 13 had resolution of HPVD, including 8 with IP and 5 with PP. Eleven recipients had persistent HPVD, including 5 with IP and 6 with PP immunosuppression. No plausible cellular recovery group (natural killer cells or T cells) showed a significant difference in HPV outcomes. One recipient died of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, presumably of anogenital origin, at 33 months post-transplantation after prolonged immunosuppression for chronic GVHD. Individual cases demonstrate the need for continued aggressive monitoring, especially in the context of disease prevalent at transplantation or prior malignancy. HCT proved curative in many cases in which HPVD was refractory and recurrent prior to transplantation, supporting a recommendation that HPVD should be considered an indication rather than contraindication to HCT, but post-transplantation monitoring should be prolonged with a high level of vigilance for new or recurrent HPVD.",nocancer
"Institutions use a range of different detector systems for patient-specific quality assurance (QA) measurements conducted to assure that the dose delivered by a patient's radiotherapy treatment plan matches the calculated dose distribution. However, the ability of different detectors to detect errors from different sources is often unreported. This study contains a systematic evaluation of Sun Nuclear's ArcCHECK in terms of the detectability of potential machine-related treatment errors. The five investigated sources of error were multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf positions, gantry angle, collimator angle, jaw positions, and dose output. The study encompassed the clinical treatment plans of 29 brain cancer patients who received stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). Six error magnitudes were investigated per source of error. In addition, the Eclipse AAA beam model dosimetric leaf gap (DLG) parameter was varied with four error magnitudes. Error detectability was determined based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Detectability of DLG errors was good or excellent (AUC >0.8) at an error magnitude of at least +-0.4 mm, while MLC leaf position and gantry angle errors reached good or excellent detectability at error magnitudes of at least 1.0 mm and 0.6 , respectively. Ideal thresholds, that is, gamma passing rates, to maximize sensitivity and specificity ranged from 79.1% to 98.7%. The detectability of collimator angle, jaw position, and dose output errors was poor for all investigated error magnitudes, with an AUC between 0.5 and 0.6. The ArcCHECK device's ability to detect errors from treatment machine-related sources was evaluated, and ideal gamma passing rate thresholds were determined for each source of error. The ArcCHECK was able to detect errors in DLG value, MLC leaf positions, and gantry angle. The ArcCHECK was unable to detect the studied errors in collimator angle, jaw positions, and dose output.",nocancer
"Background and Objectives: Primary gastric diffuse large-B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is an aggressive lymphoma subtype with high 18F-FDG avidity but unclear criteria for 2-[18F]-FDG PET/CT in the evaluation of treatment response and prognostication. Our aim was to investigate whether the pretreatment 2-[18F]-FDG PET/CT variables may predict treatment response (at end of first-line therapy) and prognosis in primary gastric DLBCL. Materials and Methods: we included 57 patients with a diagnosis of primary gastric DLBCL and a baseline 2-[18F]-FDG PET/CT and an end of treatment PET/CT after 6 cycles of R-CHOP chemotherapy. We analyzed PET images qualitatively and semi-quantitatively by deriving the maximum standardized uptake value body weight (SUVbw), the maximum standardized uptake value lean body mass (SUVlbm), the maximum standardized uptake value body surface area (SUVbsa), lesion to liver SUVmax ratio (L-L SUV R), lesion to blood-pool SUVmax ratio (L-BP SUV R), metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis of gastric lesion (gMTV and gTLG), and total MTV (tMTV) and TLG. Survival curves were plotted according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: at a median follow up of 80 months, the median PFS and OS were 69 and 80 months. Baseline gMTV, gTLG, tMTV, and TLG were significantly higher in patients with incomplete response (partial response and progression) compared to complete response group. tMTV and TLG were confirmed to be independent prognostic factors both for PFS (p = 0.023 and p = 0.038) and OS (p = 0.038 and p = 0.026); instead, the other metabolic parameters were not related to outcome survival. Conclusions: high tMTV and TLG were significantly correlated with shorter survival (PFS and OS) and may predict incomplete response after therapy.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To describe the item development and cognitive evaluation process used in creating the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Bladder Health Instrument (PLUS-BHI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Questions assessing bladder health were developed using reviews of published items, expert opinion, and focus groups' transcript review. Candidate items were tested through cognitive interviews with community-dwelling women and an online panel survey. Items were assessed for comprehension, language, and response categories and modified iteratively to create the PLUS-BHI. RESULTS: Existing measures of bladder function (storage, emptying, sensation components) and bladder health impact required modification of time frame and response categories to capture a full range of bladder health. 167 women (18-80 years) completed individual interviews and 791 women (18-88 years) completed the online panel survey. The term ""bladder health"" was unfamiliar for most and was conceptualized primarily as absence of severe urinary symptoms, infection, or cancer. Coping mechanisms and self-management strategies were central to bladder health perceptions. The inclusion of prompts and response categories that captured infrequent symptoms increased endorsement of symptoms across bladder function components. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder health measurement is challenged by a lack of awareness of normal function, use of self-management strategies to mitigate impact on activities, and a common tendency to overlook infrequent LUTS. The PLUS-BHI is designed to characterize the full spectrum of bladder health in women and will be validated for research use.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Baricitinib, a selective Janus kinase 1/Janus kinase 2 inhibitor, is indicated in the European Union and Japan for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of baricitinib 2 mg in the AD clinical program. METHODS: Six double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled studies, and two long-term extension studies were summarized in two datasets. Placebo comparison was based on six 16-week studies with baricitinib 2 mg. All-bari-2-mg-AD included patients who received baricitinib 2 mg at any time during the eight studies. RESULTS: In total, 1598 patients received once-daily baricitinib 2 mg for 1434.2 patient-years of exposure (median 330 days/maximum 2.4 years). Treatment-emergent adverse events were higher for baricitinib 2 mg (57.9%) vs placebo (51.6%). Serious adverse events, serious infections, and opportunistic infections were low in frequency and similar between baricitinib 2 mg and placebo. There were no malignancies, gastrointestinal perforations, or major adverse cardiovascular events with baricitinib 2 mg in the placebo-controlled period. Herpes simplex (cluster) was higher for baricitinib 2 mg (3.8%) vs placebo (2.8%); rates decreased with extended 2 mg exposure. In All-bari-2-mg-AD, there were five malignancies other than non-melanoma skin cancer, two major adverse cardiovascular events, one peripheral venous thrombosis, one arterial thrombosis, and no pulmonary embolisms, deep vein thromboses, or deaths. CONCLUSIONS: This integrated analysis in patients with moderate-to-severe AD confirms the established safety profile of baricitinib 2 mg. Longer exposure to treatment is required to evaluate risks of malignancies and major adverse cardiovascular events.

"The transplantation field requires the identification of specific risk factors associated with the level of immunosuppression. Here, our aim was to analyze the association between the number of circulating lymphocytes, monitored routinely by complete blood cell counts during outpatient visits, and patient and graft survival. In total, 2,999 kidney or combined kidney-pancreas recipients transplanted between 2000 and 2016, from two University hospitals, were enrolled. We investigated the etiological relationship between time-dependent lymphocyte count beyond one year after transplantation and patient and graft survival, viral infection and cancer risk using time-dependent multivariate Cox models. Model 1 considered kidney function at one year and model 2 as time-dependent variable. At the time of inclusion (one year after transplantation), 584 patients (19.4%) had deep lymphopenia (under 750 /mm3) and 1,072 (35.7%) had a normal count (over 1,500 /mm3). A patient with deep lymphopenia at a given follow-up time had significantly higher risks of graft failure, death and viral infection than comparable patients with a normal lymphocyte count at the same time point. Thus, after the first year of transplantation, the occurrence of deep lymphopenia within a patient's follow-up is a risk factor for long-term graft failure, death and viral infection.",nocancer
"In 2015, glyphosate was classified as ""Group 2A - probably carcinogenic to humans"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Therefore, public concerns about the environmental and health risks of this substance have rapidly increased. Considering its toxicokinetic characteristics, urinary levels of glyphosate could be a powerful tool for human biomonitoring. Nevertheless, the physicochemical properties of this molecule and the complexity of the matrix make this purpose particularly challenging. In order to solve this problem, the presented study describes a simple LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of glyphosate in human urine after pre-column derivatization with FMOC-Cl. Method development was focused on the optimization of the derivatization reaction in human urine, adjusting critical variables such as pH of borate buffer, FMOC-Cl concentration and derivatization time. Besides, chromatographic separation and spectrometric parameters were also established. The analytical method was fully validated according international guidelines for selectivity, carry over, linearity, accuracy, precision, lower limit of quantitation, matrix effect and stability under different conditions. All performance parameters were within the acceptance criteria. In addition, the method was successfully applied to 52 urine samples obtained from exposed subjects from northern Argentina, laying the foundation for future epidemiological studies.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The size, shape, and position of the pancreas are affected by the patient characteristics such as age, sex, adiposity. Owing to more complex anatomical structures (size, shape, and position) of the pancreas, specialists have some difficulties in the analysis of pancreatic diseases (diabetes, pancreatic cancer, pancreatitis). Therefore, the treatment of the disease requires enormous time and depends on the experience of specialists. In order to decrease the rate of pancreatic disease deaths and to assist the specialist in the analysis of pancreatic diseases, automatic pancreas segmentation techniques have been actively developed in the research article for many years. METHODS: Although the rapid growth of deep learning and proving satisfactory performance in many medical image processing and computer vision applications, the maximum Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) value of these techniques related to automatic pancreas segmentation is only around 85% due to complex structure of the pancreas and other factors. Contrary to previous techniques which are required significantly higher computational power and memory, this paper suggests a novel two-phase approach for high-accuracy automatic pancreas segmentation in computed tomography (CT) imaging. The proposed approach consists of two phases; (1) Pancreas Localization, where the rough pancreas position is detected on the 2D CT slice by adopting Mask R-CNN model, (2) Pancreas Segmentation, where the segmented pancreas region is produced by refining the candidate pancreas region with 3D U-Net on the 2D sub-CT slices generated in the first phase. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the proposed approach are performed on the NIH data set. RESULTS: In order to evaluate the achievement of the recommended approach, a total of 16 different automatic pancreas segmentation techniques reported in the literature are compared by utilizing performance assessment procedures which are Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Jaccard Index (JI), Precision (PRE), Recall (REC), Pixel Accuracy (ACC), Specificity (SPE), Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) and Area under ROC curve (AUC). The average values of DSC, JI, REC and ACC are computed as 86.15%, 75.93%, 86.27%, 86.27% and 99.95% respectively, which are the best values among well-established studies for automatic pancreas segmentation. CONCLUSION: It is demonstrated with qualitative and quantitative results that our suggested two-phase approach creates more favorable results than other existing approaches.",nocancer
"Magnetic iron oxide nanocrystals (MIONs) are established as potent theranostic nanoplatforms due to their biocompatibility and the multifunctionality of their spin-active atomic framework. Recent insights have also unveiled their attractive near-infrared photothermal properties, which are, however, limited by their low near-infrared absorbance, resulting in noncompetitive photothermal conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Herein, we report on the dramatically improved photothermal conversion of condensed clustered MIONs, reaching an ultrahigh PCE of 71% at 808 nm, surpassing the so-far MION-based photothermal agents and even benchmark near-infrared photothermal nanomaterials. Moreover, their surface passivation is achieved through a simple self-assembly process, securing high colloidal stability and structural integrity in complex biological media. The bifunctional polymeric canopy simultaneously provided binding sites for anchoring additional cargo, such as a strong near-infrared-absorbing and fluorescent dye, enabling in vivo optical and photoacoustic imaging in deep tissues, while the iron oxide core ensures detection by magnetic resonance imaging. In vitro studies also highlighted a synergy-amplified photothermal effect that significantly reduces the viability of A549 cancer cells upon 808 nm laser irradiation. Integration of such-previously elusive-photophysical properties with simple and cost-effective nanoengineering through self-assembly represents a significant step toward sophisticated nanotheranostics, with great potential in the field of nanomedicine.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The absence of a national register of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) hinders effective health care planning in Italy. AIMS: to investigate prevalence of IBD in the city of Messina, Italy, based on General Practitioner (GP) records, and to establish current treatments prescribed by different health care providers. METHODS: data were extracted from GP databases with the help of disease-specific healthcare cost exemption codes combined with ICD9 codes for ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), and prescription for mesalazine. Disease and treatment-related data were collected together with information on employment status and the current healthcare provider. RESULTS: Eighty-six GPs participated covering a population of 100,834 people. IBD prevalence (419/105) was 80% higher than estimates of the Regional Health Authorities. Incidence showed a seven-fold increase over the past 30 years. Only 51% of CD and 26% of UC patients were followed by a dedicated IBD centre with more frequent prescriptions of immunomodulators and biologics (p<0.001) compared to GPs. CONCLUSIONS: Real world data show much higher figures on IBD prevalence than administrative estimates. Differences in therapeutic approaches between IBD-specialists and non-specialists may reflect poor confidence in managing immunosuppressive therapies by the latter, but may lead to inadequate therapy and cancer surveillance.",nocancer
"Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring non-steroidal phenolic plant compounds. Their structure is similar to 17-beta-estradiol, the main female sex hormone. This review offers a concise summary of the current literature on several potential health benefits of phytoestrogens, mainly their neuroprotective effect. Phytoestrogens lower the risk of menopausal symptoms and osteoporosis, as well as cardiovascular disease. They also reduce the risk of brain disease. The effects of phytoestrogens and their derivatives on cancer are mainly due to the inhibition of estrogen synthesis and metabolism, leading to antiangiogenic, antimetastatic, and epigenetic effects. The brain controls the secretion of estrogen (hypothalamus-pituitary-gonads axis). However, it has not been unequivocally established whether estrogen therapy has a neuroprotective effect on brain function. The neuroprotective effects of phytoestrogens seem to be related to both their antioxidant properties and interaction with the estrogen receptor. The possible effects of phytoestrogens on the thyroid cause some concern; nevertheless, generally, no serious side effects have been reported, and these compounds can be recommended as health-promoting food components or supplements.",nocancer
"Peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) is an enzyme expressed in neutrophils that, when activated, can drive the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Uncontrolled activation of PAD4 and subsequent citrullination of proteins is increasingly recognized as a driver of (auto) immune diseases. Currently, our understanding of PAD4 structure-function relationships and activity control in vivo is incomplete. In this review, employed molecular modelling to generate a three-dimensional structure of the complete PAD4 molecule. Using our model we discuss the catalytic conversion of the arginine substrate to citrulline. Besides mechanistic insight into PAD4 function, we give an overview of biological functions of PAD4 and mechanisms that influence its activation. In addition we discuss the crucial role of PAD4 mediated citrullination of histones in the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps(NET). Subsequently we focus on the role of PAD4 mediated NET formation and its role in pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis and (immune-)thrombosis. Finally, we summarize current efforts to design different classes of PAD4 inhibitors that are being developed for improved treatment of autoimmune disorders as well as thrombo-inflammatory disease.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Explore the feasibility of adopting failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) for risk assessment of a high volume clinical service at a UK radiotherapy center. Compare hypothetical failure modes to locally reported incidents. METHOD: An FMEA for a lung radiotherapy service was conducted at a hospital that treats ~ 350 lung cancer patients annually with radical radiotherapy. A multidisciplinary team of seven people was identified including a nominated facilitator. A process map was agreed and failure modes identified and scored independently, final failure modes and scores were then agreed at a face-to-face meeting. Risk stratification methods were explored and staff effort recorded. Radiation incidents related to lung radiotherapy reported locally in a 2-year period were analyzed to determine their relation to the identified failure modes. The final FMEA was therefore a combination of prospective evaluation and retrospective analysis from an incident learning system. RESULTS: Thirty-six failure modes were identified for the pre-existing clinical service. The top failure modes varied according to the ranking method chosen. The process required 30 h of combined staff time. Over the 2-year period chosen, 38 voluntarily reported incidents were identified as relating to lung radiotherapy. Of these, 13 were not predicted by the identified failure modes, with six relating to delays in the process, three issues with appointment times, one communication error, two instances of a failure to image, and one technical fault deemed unpredictable by the manufacturer. Four additional failure modes were added to the FMEA following the incident analysis. CONCLUSION: FMEA can be effectively applied to an established high volume service as a risk assessment method. Facilitation by an individual familiar with the FMEA process can reduce resource requirement.

The rate-determining step of glyphosate sorption in urban soils involved chemisorption processes through exchange or sharing of electrons that followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. As evidenced by the Freundlich isotherm model, glyphosate gets partitioned into heterogeneous surfaces of soil organic matter (OM) and clay minerals, and then diffused into soil micropores. The principal component analysis revealed that soil OM (R2 = 0.873), oxides of Al (R2 = 0.361) and Fe (R2 = 0.126), and contents of clay (R2 = 0.061) and silt (R2 = 0.432) were positively correlated with the distribution coefficient (Kd) of glyphosate, while alkaline pH (R2 = -0.389) and sand content (R2 = -0.343) negatively correlated with the Kd values. Well-decomposed soil OM, consisting of C-H and CO functional groups, enhanced glyphosate sorption, whereas partially decomposed/undecomposed OM facilitated desorption process. Desorption of glyphosate was favoured in seven of nine selected soils due to adverse hysteresis effects (HI = 0.74-1.0). The higher values of leachability index (0.31-1.0) and groundwater ubiquity score (1.60-3.44) calculated for the urban soils indicated the great leaching potential of glyphosate from soil surface to waterbodies. Use of glyphosate on impermeable surfaces might directly contaminate water sources and affect potability of water, non-target biota, and food safety. The calculated values of cancer risk (10-8-10-12) and hazard quotient (1.47 x 10-6-4.12 x 10-6) suggested that the human exposure to glyphosate-contaminated soils through dermal, ingestion and inhalation pathways might cause negligible or no carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks to humans. Therefore, glyphosate should be applied judiciously at recommended concentrations in the urban landscapes, mainly on impervious surfaces, to minimize its health impacts in humans and environment.",nocancer
"Protein toxins secreted by bacteria and found in plants can be threats to human health. However, their extreme toxicity can also be exploited in different ways, e.g., to produce hybrid toxins directed against cancer cells and to study transport mechanisms in cells. Investigations during the last decades have shown how powerful these molecules are as tools in cell biological research. Here, we first present a partly historical overview, with emphasis on Shiga toxin and ricin, of how such toxins have been used to characterize processes and proteins of importance for their trafficking. In the second half of the article, we describe how one can now use toxins to investigate the role of lipid classes for intracellular transport. In recent years, it has become possible to quantify hundreds of lipid species using mass spectrometry analysis. Thus, it is also now possible to explore the importance of lipid species in intracellular transport. The detailed analyses of changes in lipids seen under conditions of inhibited toxin transport reveal previously unknown connections between syntheses of lipid classes and demonstrate the ability of cells to compensate under given conditions.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Opioid use for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is complex. In the absence of pan-European guidance on this issue, a position paper was commissioned by the European Pain Federation (EFIC). METHODS: The clinical practice recommendations were developed by eight scientific societies and one patient self-help organization under the coordination of EFIC. A systematic literature search in MEDLINE (up until January 2020) was performed. Two categories of guidance are given: Evidence-based recommendations (supported by evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials or of observational studies) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) statements (supported either by indirect evidence or by case-series, case-control studies and clinical experience). The GRADE system was applied to move from evidence to recommendations. The recommendations and GCP statements were developed by a multiprofessional task force (including nursing, service users, physicians, physiotherapy and psychology) and formal multistep procedures to reach a set of consensus recommendations. The clinical practice recommendations were reviewed by five external reviewers from North America and Europe and were also posted for public comment. RESULTS: The key clinical practice recommendations suggest: (a) first optimizing established non-pharmacological treatments and non-opioid analgesics and (b) considering opioid treatment if established non-pharmacological treatments or non-opioid analgesics are not effective and/or not tolerated and/or contraindicated. Evidence- and clinical consensus-based potential indications and contraindications for opioid treatment are presented. Eighteen GCP recommendations give guidance regarding clinical evaluation, as well as opioid treatment assessment, monitoring, continuation and discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: Opioids remain a treatment option for some selected patients with CNCP under careful surveillance.",nocancer
"Health benefits of whole wheat products are partially attributed by their unique phenolic compounds. This study investigated effect of simulated gastrointestinal digestion and probiotic fermentation on releasing of phenolic acids from whole wheat foods (bread, cookie, and pasta). Kinetics results showed that more phenolic acids were released within the first hour of gastric and intestinal digestions compared to the prolonged digestion. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a common probiotic strain, released additional phenolic acids from the digestive residues during fermentation. Simulated digestion released more soluble trans-ferulic acid than chemical extraction in breads (17.69 to 102.71 microg/g), cookie (15.81 to 54.43 microg/g), and pasta (4.88 to 28.39 microg/g). Phenolic acid composition of whole wheat products appeared to be better estimated by digestion methods than the chemical extraction method. The unique insoluble-bound nature and fermentability of wheat phenolic acids may lead to a mechanistic understanding of whole grain consumption for potential colorectal cancer prevention.",nocancer
"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in physiological cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis by acting as signaling molecules or regulators of transcription factors. The maintenance of appropriate cellular ROS levels is termed redox homeostasis, a balance between their production and neutralization. High concentrations of ROS may contribute to severe pathological events including cancer, neurodegenerative, and cardiovascular diseases. In recent years, approaches to target the sources of ROS production directly in order to develop tool compounds or potential therapeutics have been explored. Herein, we briefly outline the major sources of cellular ROS production and comprehensively review the targeting of these by small-molecule inhibitors. We critically assess the value of ROS inhibitors with different mechanisms-of-action, including their potency, mode-of-action, known off-target effects, and clinical or preclinical status, while suggesting future avenues of research in the field.",nocancer
"Tuberculosis (TB) pleural effusion (TPE) is the second most common manifestation of extrapulmonary TB (EPTB), which remains a great diagnostic challenge worldwide. In Uzbekistan, there has been no formal evaluation of the actual practices of diagnosing and treating TPE. Our cohort study therefore aimed to describe the frequency and types of different diagnostic procedures of TPE during 2017-2018 and assess the association of baseline characteristics and establish diagnostic methods with TB treatment outcomes. In total, 187 patients with presumptive TPE were assessed, and 149 had a confirmed diagnosis of TPE (other diagnoses included cancer n = 8, pneumonia n = 17, and 13 cases were unspecified). TB was bacteriologically confirmed in 22 (14.8%), cytologically confirmed in 64 (43.0%), and histologically confirmed in 16 (10.7%) patients. Hepatitis was the only co-morbidity significantly associated with unsuccessful treatment outcomes (RR 4.8; 95%CI: 1.44-15.98, p value 0.011). Multivariable regression analysis showed that drug-resistant TB was independently associated with unsuccessful TB treatment outcome. (RR 3.83; 95%CI: 1.05-14.02, p value 0.04). Multidisciplinary approaches are required to maximize the diagnostic accuracy of TPE and minimize the chances of misdiagnosis. TPE patients with co-infections and those with drug resistance should be more closely monitored to try and ensure successful TB treatment outcomes.",nocancer
"The present study attempted to investigate whether concerted contributions of significant risk variables, pro-inflammatory markers, and candidate genes translate into a predictive marker for knee osteoarthritis (KOA). The present study comprised 279 confirmed osteoarthritis patients (Kellgren and Lawrence scale >2) and 287 controls. Twenty SNPs within five genes (CRP, COL1A1, IL-6, VDR, and eNOS), four pro-inflammatory markers (interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleuin-1 beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)), along with significant risk variables were investigated. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to observe the predictive ability of the model for distinguishing patients with KOA. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that higher body mass index (BMI), triglycerides (TG), poor sleep, IL-6, IL-1beta, and hsCRP were independent predictors for KOA after adjusting for the confounding from other risk variables. Four susceptibility haplotypes for the risk of KOA, AGT, GGGGCT, AGC, and CTAAAT, were observed within CRP, IL-6, VDR, and eNOS genes, which showed their impact in recessive beta(SE): 2.11 (0.76), recessive beta(SE): 2.75 (0.59), dominant beta(SE): 1.89 (0.52), and multiplicative modes beta(SE): 1.89 (0.52), respectively. ROC curve analysis revealed the model comprising higher values of BMI, poor sleep, IL-6, and IL-1beta was predictive of KOA (AUC: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.74-0.86, p< 0.001), and the strength of the predictive ability increased when susceptibility haplotypes AGC and GGGGCT were involved (AUC: 0.90, 95%CI: 0.87-0.95, p< 0.001).This study offers a predictive marker for KOA based on the risk scores of some pertinent genes and their genetic variants along with some pro-inflammatory markers and traditional risk variables.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Local treatment of metastases in combination with systemic therapy can prolong survival of oligo-metastasized patients. To fully exploit this potential, safe and effective treatments are needed to ensure long-term metastases control. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is one means, however, for moving liver tumors correct delivery of high doses is challenging. After validating equal in-vivo treatment accuracy, we analyzed a pooled multi-platform liver-SBRT-database for clinical outcome. METHODS: Local control (LC), progression-free interval (PFI), overall survival (OS), predictive factors and toxicity was evaluated in 135 patients with 227 metastases treated by gantry-based SBRT (deep-inspiratory breath-hold-gating; n=71) and robotic-based SBRT (fiducial-tracking, n=156) with mean gross tumor volume biological effective dose (GTV-BEDalpha/beta=10Gy) of 146.6Gy10. RESULTS: One-, and five-year LC was 90% and 68.7%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, LC was significantly predicted by colorectal histology (p=0.006). Median OS was 20 months with one- and two-year OS of 67% and 37%. On multivariate analysis, ECOG-status (p=0.003), simultaneous chemotherapy (p=0.003), time from metastasis detection to SBRT-treatment (>=2months; p=0.021) and LC of the treated metastases (>=12months, p<0.009) were significant predictors for OS. One- and two-year PFI were 30.5% and 14%. Acute toxicity was mild and rare (14.4% grade I, 2.3% grade II, 0.6% grade III). Chronic  III/IV toxicities occurred in 1.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Patient selection, time to treatment and sufficient doses are essential to achieve optimal outcome for SBRT with active motion compensation. Local control appears favorable compared to historical control. Long-term LC of the treated lesions was associated with longer overall survival.",nocancer
"Helicobacter Pylori, a Gram-negative bacterium in the human stomach, causes adenocarcinoma and MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma in addition to infection and gastric ulcer. With regard to Helicobacter Pylori prevalence rate and widespread, producing an effective vaccine against this bacterium appears reasonable and necessary. Today, vaccine design by immunoinformatics is a promising solution in vaccine field. In the present study, potential immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes of UreB, HpaA, and NapA antigens were selected with a focus on IFN-gamma secretion inducing ability. After joining the selected epitopes with KK and GPGPG linkers, sequence of Melittin, the major active protein of honey bee venom, was put in C-terminal by DPRVPSS linker as adjuvant. After reverse translation and codon optimization, the designed vaccine was cloned into pET-23a vector. The final construct was estimated as antigenic (71 & 74%) and non-allergenic with molecular weight of 36.785KD. The instability index (II) and codon frequency distribution were predicted to be 26.5 and 92%, respectively. The pET-23a vector transformed to the E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain. The evaluation of expression by SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the optimized expression is in SOB medium 8 hours after induction by 0.5 mM IPTG. Finally, purification was performed by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and western blot analysis validated the purified protein. Future research is needed to investigate the designed vaccine efficiency against H. pylori, and also it's potential as a gastric cancer-preventive candidate.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of MDCT with axial images and multiplanar reformatted (MPR) images from the urothelial phase of the bladder in patients with hematuria using cystoscopy as the reference standard. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our IRB for human investigation approved this study, and informed consent was waived. We included 192 patients (121 men, 71 women; age range 17-90 years; mean age +- SD: 60 +- 14 years) who underwent contrast-enhanced MDCT (scan delay: 70 s; section thickness: 2 mm) and conventional cystoscopy examination for painless gross hematuria or recurrent microscopic hematuria. Two radiologists in consensus interpreted the images for the presence or absence of bladder lesions. Using the kappa statistic, the patient-based agreement was determined between the CT and cystoscopic findings. We compared the diagnostic performance of axial images to those with coronal and sagittal reformations to detect bladder lesions. RESULTS: MDCT showed excellent agreement between cystoscopy-axial scans (kappa = 0.896) and axial with reformatted images (kappa = 0.948). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of MDCT were 94%, 96%, and 95% in the axial scans and 98%, 97%, and 97% in the axial with reformatted images, respectively. All statistical parameters of diagnostic performance were similar between the axial and the reformatted images (p > .05). CONCLUSION: Axial MDCT imaging demonstrates high diagnostic performance in detecting bladder lesions, but additional reformatted images can improve diagnostic accuracy.",nocancer
"Cough and sputum are common complaints at outpatient visits. In this digest version, we provide a general overview of these two symptoms and discuss the management of acute (up to three weeks) and prolonged/chronic cough (longer than three weeks). Flowcharts are provided, along with a step-by-step explanation of their diagnosis and management. Most cases of acute cough are due to an infection. In chronic respiratory illness, a cough could be a symptom of a respiratory infection such as pulmonary tuberculosis, malignancy such as a pulmonary tumor, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, drug-induced lung injury, heart failure, nasal sinus disease, sinobronchial syndrome, eosinophilic sinusitis, cough variant asthma (CVA), atopic cough, chronic laryngeal allergy, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and post-infectious cough. Antibiotics should not be prescribed for over-peak cough but can be considered for atypical infections. The exploration of a single/major cause is recommended for persistent/chronic cough. When sputum is present, a sputum smear/culture (general bacteria, mycobacteria), cytology, cell differentiation, chest computed tomography (CT), and sinus X-ray or CT should be performed. There are two types of rhinosinusitis. Conventional sinusitis and eosinophilic rhinosinusitis present primarily with neutrophilic inflammation and eosinophilic inflammation, respectively. The most common causes of dry cough include CVA, atopic cough/laryngeal allergy (chronic), GER, and post-infectious cough. In the last chapter, future challenges and perspectives are discussed. We hope that the clarification of the pathology of cough hypersensitivity syndrome will lead to further development of ""pathology-specific non-specific therapeutic drugs"" and provide benefits to patients with chronic refractory cough.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine the natural history of geriatric assessment (GA) and quality of life (QOL) domains among adults age >= 50 years undergoing autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autoHCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A QOL tool and cancer-specific GA were completed before autoHCT in patients >=50 years, and at 100 days, six months, and one year post-transplant. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-four patients completed the pre-transplant QOL/GA assessment, 169 (92%) completed the 100-day assessment, 162 (88%) completed the six-month assessment, and 145 (79%) completed the twelve-month assessment. Functional status, as measured by instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), decreased from baseline to day 101 (mean change -0.42 points, 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.09, p = 0.01) but returned to baseline by one year. Physical function as measured by Medical Outcomes Study-Physical Health (MOS-PH) increased by mean of 3.27 points (95% CI, -0.02 to 6.56, p = 0.05) by one year. Physician-rated KPS improved by one year, but patient-rated KPS did not. No QOL metric deteriorated from baseline. Baseline factors predictive of IADL and MOS-PH as measured over time included comorbidities and disease status at transplant. IADL and MOS-PH as measured over time were not significantly associated with age. CONCLUSIONS: AutoHCT for adults age >= 50 years resulted in an initial decrease in functional status, with subsequent improvement back to baseline by one year. Physical health and QOL measures were improved or unchanged over time. AutoHCT is well tolerated in well selected older patients, using patient reported geriatric metrics as outcomes.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: the frequency of distal femur fractures in the elderly is rapidly increasing. A study of these fractures was conducted in our center in order to evaluate the comorbidities and the mortality associated with this entity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: all the distal femur fractures by low energy in patients over 65 years old at a tertiary center were included, between January 2010 and December 2016. Baseline characteristics, the type of fracture, comorbidities, and functional status before admission, were collected. The relationship of each of these variables to the final functional class, immediate and late complications and mortality during the follow-up. Fifty-nine patients were included, with a median age of 85.3 years (IQR 78.6-91.6). Fifty-one patients were women. In 10 patients, the fractures were atraumatic (postural change mainly in non-walking patients), and in 54 of the cases were treated surgically (6 with retrograde intramedullary nailing and 48 with lateral locking plate). The median time to surgery was 4.5 days (IQR 2-6) and 14 patients were operated within 48 hours. The median follow-up was 26.3 months. RESULTS: fourteen patients died during the first year of follow-up. Factors independently associated with death during the first year after the fracture were: conservative treatment, and the inability to ambulate before the episode. The absence of certain comorbidities, such as chronic heart disease, and cancer, and an age under 80 years, behaved as protective factors. CONCLUSION: low-energy distal femur fractures comprise a severe injury in the elderly and are associated with high mortality. Surgical treatment showed better outcomes in terms of survival, with no significant differences depending on the type of fracture, the type of implant or the median time to surgery.",nocancer
"The indolocarbazole family of bisindole alkaloids is best known for the natural product staurosporine, a protein kinase C inhibitor that belongs to the indolo[2,3-a]carbazole structural class. A large number of other indolo[2,3-a]carbazoles have subsequently been isolated and identified, but other isomeric forms of indolocarbazole natural products have rarely been reported. An extract of the marine sponge Damiria sp., which represents an understudied genus, provided two novel alkaloids named damirines A (1) and B (2). Their structures were assigned by comprehensive NMR spectroscopic analyses, and for compound 2, this included application of the LR-HSQMBC pulse sequence, a long-range heteronuclear correlation experiment that has particular utility for defining proton-deficient scaffolds. The damirines represent a new hexacyclic carbon-nitrogen framework comprised of an indolo[3,2-a]carbazole fused with either an aminoimidazole or a imidazolone ring. Compound 1 showed selective cytotoxic properties toward six different cell lines in the NCI-60 cancer screen.",nocancer
"Brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are urgent medical problems, which severely threaten the life quality of patients and their carers. However, there are currently no effective therapies. Fucoidan is a natural compound found in brown algae and some animals, which has multiple biological and pharmacological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-coagulant, anti-thrombotic, immunoregulatory, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory effects. A growing number of studies have shown that fucoidan also exerts a neuroprotective function. Particularly, recent findings have indicated that fucoidan could slow down the neurodegenerative processes and show protective effects against brain injury, which might be of therapeutic value for intervening in brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we have discussed the pharmacokinetics of fucoidan as well as the molecular mechanisms by which fucoidan exerts its neuroprotective effect on some neurological disorders. Along with this, we have also summarized the potential benefits of fucoidan in combination with other drugs in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and brain injury. Although the extraction process of fucoidan has been improved well, more efforts should be devoted to the translational research and clinical trials of fucoidan in the near future.",nocancer
"Galectin-3 is a member of a family of beta-galactoside-binding proteins. A substantial body of literature reports that galectin-3 plays important roles in cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis. Small-molecule galectin-3 inhibitors, which are generally lactose or galactose-based derivatives, have the potential to be valuable disease-modifying agents. In our efforts to identify novel galectin-3 disaccharide mimics to improve drug-like properties, we found that one of the monosaccharide subunits can be replaced with a suitably functionalized tetrahydropyran ring. Optimization of the structure-activity relationships around the tetrahydropyran-based scaffold led to the discovery of potent galectin-3 inhibitors. Compounds 36, 40, and 45 were selected for further in vivo evaluation. The synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and in vivo evaluation of novel tetrahydropyran-based galectin-3 inhibitors are described.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 predisposes patients to a higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), although the extent of these implications is unclear and the risk of bleeding has been poorly evaluated. To date, no studies have reported long-term outcomes of patients with COVID-19 and VTE. METHOD: Prospective observational study to evaluate long-term (90 days or more) outcomes of patients diagnosed with VTE (PE, DVT of the extremities or both) in the setting of COVID-19. The main outcome of the study was a compound of major bleeding and death. RESULTS: the study comprised 100 patients (mean age 65 +/-13.9 years). At the time of VTE diagnosis, 66% patients were hospitalized, 34.8% of them in the ICU. Mean follow-up was 97.9 +/-23.3 days. During the study period 24% patients died and median time to death was 12 (IQR: 2.25-20.75) days, 11% patients had major bleeding and median time to event was 12 (IQR: 5-16) days. The cause of death was PE in 5% and bleeding in 2% of patients. There were no VTE recurrences. The main study outcome occurred in 29% patients. Risk of death or major bleeding were independently associated with ICU admission (HR 12.2; 95% CI 3.0-48.3), thrombocytopenia (HR 4.5; 95% CI 1.2-16.5) and cancer (HR 21.6; 95% CI 1.8-259). CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19 and VTE, mortality and major bleeding were high and almost a third of deaths were VTE-related. The majority of complications occurred in the first 30 days. ICU admission, thrombocytopenia and cancer are risk factors for poor prognosis.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To characterize the indications for and complication rates of excision of the retained cervix after supracervical hysterectomy. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of women undergoing excision of the retained cervix after supracervical hysterectomy in the 2010-2014 National Inpatient Sample. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were used to identify indication for the procedure and surgical complications. We weighted the hospital-level data to obtain nationwide estimates of patient characteristics, surgical complications, and length of stay. RESULTS: Nationwide, 1,140 women underwent excision of the retained cervix after hysterectomy. Their mean age was 49 years, and the majority were White and privately insured. Leiomyomas were the most commonly coded indication (35%, 95% CI 29-42), followed by prolapse (14%, 95% CI 9-18). Eighteen percent (95% CI 13.0-23.1) were performed for malignancy, including 5.3% (95% CI 2.3-8.2) for cervical cancer. Only 11.5% (95% CI 7.3-15.6) of cases were performed laparoscopically. The overall complication rate was high (38%, 95% CI 32-45), particularly for bleeding complications (26%, 95% CI 20-31) and transfusion (15%, 95% CI 11-20). Gastrointestinal complication rates were second highest (8%, 95% CI 5-12); ileus was the most common gastrointestinal complication (7.0%, 95% CI 3.7-10.4). The median length of stay was 2 days (range 0-34). CONCLUSION: Women who undergo excision of the retained cervix after supracervical hysterectomy experience high rates of complications, the most common of which was bleeding. Patient counseling regarding removal of the cervix at the time of hysterectomy should include this information.",nocancer
"The Brazilian legislation does not provide for a periodic review of the registration of pesticides and, even nowadays, products banned in other countries are still used. Based on the pesticide active substances registered in the country, the present study investigated the international regulatory situation in the following member countries: Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), European Community, and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). Moreover, we sought to relate the main chronic effects to human health and the environment of the most commercialized pesticide active substances in Brazil in lists of classification of carcinogenic potential (US Environmental Protection Agency - USEPA and International Agency for Research on Cancer - IARC), endocrine disruption, and candidates for substitution, both from the European Community. A total of 399 pesticide active substances registered in Brazil for agricultural use were identified, excluding microbiological and biological control agents. Of these, the percentage of unauthorized pesticide active substances according to countries is as follows: 85.7% in Iceland; 84.7% in Norway; 54.5% in Switzerland; 52.6% in India; 45.6% in Turkey; 44.4% in Israel; 43.4% in New Zealand; 42.4% in Japan; 41.5% in the European Community; 39.6% in Canada; 38.6% in China; 35.8% in Chile; 31.6% in Mexico; 28.6% in Australia; and 25.6% in the United States. 120 pesticide active substances were related to damage to health and the environment. Considering the pesticide active substances for which commercialization data are available in the country, 67.2% of this volume is associated with at least one serious chronic damage assessed in this study. The results of the present study indicate the need for promoting transparency of international databases, regarding the motivations of the respective regulatory decisions and the Brazilian regulatory bodies to reevaluate the registration of obsolete products and to strengthen public policies related to the reduction of the use of pesticides.",nocancer
"The objectives of the current study are to investigate the concentration, biological risks, chemical speciation, and mobility potential of heavy metals and also the determination of spatial distribution, physicochemical characteristics, and abundance of microplastics in coastal sediments and edible bivalves of the Persian Gulf, the coastal area of Hormozgan Province. Sampling points were selected considering the location of industrial, urban and Hara forest protected areas. In November 2017, a total of 18 sediment samples from coastal sediments (top 0-10 cm) and the most consumed bivalve species in the region were collected from two stations of Lengeh and Bandar Abbas Ports. The average concentration of heavy metals (except for Ni and Cd) in the sediments were lower than their average shale and the upper continental crust. Enrichment factors revealed significant enrichment of Ni, Mn, Cr, Cd and As. The fractionation of heavy metals using the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) sequential extraction scheme indicated the high bioavailability potential of Zn, As, Mn, and Co. In general, the highest concentration of Mo, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, Cu, Mn, Hg, and Sb was detected in areas with frequent human activities including Shahid Rajaee Port, Shahid Bahonar Port, and Tavanir station, respectively. Shahid Rajaee and Shahid Bahonar Ports are the most important ports on the coast of Hormozgan province. The Risk Assessment Code calculated for the study elements indicates that As, Co, Zn, and Cu pose a moderate environmental risk and a threat to aquatic biota. Health risks of most heavy metals exposed from bivalves consumption were safe, except for As which is associated with the high target cancer risk values. With reference to the type of microplastics found, they were mainly fibers with lengths ranging between 100 and 250 mum in sediments and bivalves. Most of the microfibers found in the sediments were made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP), and the fibers found in the bivalves were made of PP.",nocancer
"In addition to ribosomal protein synthesis and protein translation, ribosomal proteins also participate in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, immune responses, and viral replication. Here, we show that ribosomal protein L13 (RPL13) participates in the antiviral immune response induced by foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), inhibiting FMDV replication. The overexpression of RPL13 promoted the induction and activation of the promoters of the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and interferon-beta (IFN-beta) genes, and the expression and protein secretion of the antiviral factor IFN-beta and proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). The knockdown of RPL13 had the opposite effects. We also found that the FMDV 3Cpro protease interacts with RPL13, and that its activity reduces the expression of RPL13, thus antagonizing the RPL13-mediated antiviral activity. This study extends our knowledge of the extraribosomal functions of ribosomal proteins and provides new scientific information on cellular antiviral defenses and virus-antagonizing mechanisms.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Fluorescence angiography (FA) assesses anastomotic perfusion during esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction, but its interpretation is subjective. This study evaluated time to fluorescent enhancement in the gastric conduit, with the aim to determine a threshold to predict postoperative anastomotic complications. METHODS: In a prospective cohort study, all consecutive patients undergoing esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction from July 2018 to October 2019 were included. FA was performed before anastomotic reconstruction following injection of indocyanine green (ICG). During FA, the following time points were recorded: ICG injection, first fluorescent enhancement in the lung, at the base of the gastric conduit, at the planned anastomotic site, and at ICG watershed or in the tip of the gastric conduit. Anastomotic complications including anastomotic leakage and clinically relevant strictures were documented. RESULTS: Eighty-four patients were included, the majority (67 out of 84, 80%) of which underwent an Ivor Lewis procedure. After a median follow-up of 297 days, anastomotic leakage was observed in 12 out of 84 (14.3%) and anastomotic stricture in 12 out of 82 (14.6%). Time between ICG injection and enhancement in the tip was predictive for anastomotic leakage (P = 0.174, area under the curve = 0.731), and a cut-off value of 98 seconds was derived (specificity: 98%). All times to enhancement at the planned anastomotic site and ICG watershed were significantly predictive for the occurrence of a stricture, however area under the curves were <0.7.

It blocks Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) signal pathway by binding its receptor. Recently, it has been claimed that PGRN may be overexpressed in patients with Osteoarthritis (OA). However, these patients tend to be obese and obesity also may be one of the factors that affect PGRN levels. The aim of this study was to compare the PGRN levels of patients with Knee OA (KOA) with that of healthy controls by eliminating the effect of obesity and to evaluate PGRN-to-Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) ratio in KOA, both of which were investigated first in literature by this study. METHODS: A total of 80 individuals (40 patients with KOA and 40 healthy controls) were included in this study. The patients and controls were divided into two groups according to their Body Mass Indexes (BMI): nonobese (BMI between 18.5 and 24.9) and obese (BMI of 30 or higher). Each of the groups included 20 subjects and had an equal number of men and women. Blood samples were obtained from all participants, and the serum PGRN and TNF-alpha levels were measured using commercial ELISA kits. RESULTS: There was no difference among groups in terms of age (P = 0.416) and gender distribution. There was no statistical difference among study groups with regard to serum PGRN levels. Serum TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in obese controls (P < 0.001) and nonobese patients (P = 0.003) compared to that of nonobese healthy controls. Correspondingly, serum PGRN-to-TNF-alpha ratio was considerably lower in obese controls (P < 0.001) and nonobese patients (P < 0.001) by comparison with that of nonobese healthy controls. CONCLUSION: We determined that both obesity and KOA increased serum TNF-alpha levels and concordantly decreased serum PGRNto- TNF-alpha ratio. The results of the study suggest that the activation of the PGRN pathway and/or the inhibition of the TNFalpha pathway may be essential in terms of the reestablishment of the disrupted inflammatory balance in patients with KOA.

"HIV infection is presented in the chapters of the Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Comprehensive Care for People with Sexually Transmitted Infections, published by the Brazilian Ministry of Health in 2020. Health professionals and managers must learn the signs and symptoms of HIV infection and know how to diagnose it to provide appropriate treatment and reduce complications. HIV infection has become a chronic disease. Its treatment includes addressing common comorbidities such as arterial hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, in addition to cardiac risk assessment, cancer prevention, and guidance on immunization. Initiation of treatment for HIV patients is recommended regardless of clinical or immunological criteria as adopted by the Ministry of Health since 2013. Lately, it has been simplified with more tolerable first-line medications and fewer drug interactions, making its management easy to implement, including by primary health care. HIV cases are concentrated in specific population groups, such as sex workers, men who have sex with men, transexuals, people who use alcohol or other drugs, and vulnerable people, such as black, incarcerated, or people living on the streets.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To develop a two-stage 3D-CNN for fully automated volumetric segmentation of pancreas on CT and to further evaluate its performance in the context of intra-reader and inter-reader reliability at full dose and reduced radiation dose CTs on a public dataset. METHODS: A dataset of 1994 abdomen CT scans (portal venous phase, slice thickness <= 3.75-mm, multiple CT vendors) was curated by two radiologists (R1 and R2) to exclude cases with pancreatic pathology, sub-optimal image quality, and image artifacts (n=77). Remaining 1917 CTs were equally allocated between R1 and R2 for volumetric pancreas segmentation [ground truth (GT)]. This internal dataset was randomly divided into training (n=1380), validation (n=248) and test (n=289) sets for the development of a two-stage 3D CNN model based on a modified U-net architecture for automated volumetric pancreas segmentation. Model's performance for pancreas segmentation and the differences in model-predicted pancreatic volumes versus GT volumes were compared on the test set. Subsequently, an external dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) that had CT scans acquired at standard radiation dose and same scans reconstructed at a simulated 25% radiation dose was curated (n=41). Volumetric pancreas segmentation was done on this TCIA dataset by R1 and R2 independently on the full dose and then at the reduced radiation dose CT images. Intra-reader and inter-reader reliability, model's segmentation performance, and reliability between model-predicted pancreatic volumes at full versus reduced-dose were measured. Finally, model's performance was tested on the benchmarking National Institute of Health (NIH)-Pancreas CT (PCT) dataset. RESULTS: 3D-CNN had mean (SD) Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC): 0.91 (0.03) and average Hausdorff distance of 0.15 (0.09) mm on the test set. Model's performance was equivalent between males and females (p=0.08) and across different CT slice thicknesses (p>0.05) based on non-inferiority statistical testing. There was no difference in model-predicted and GT pancreatic volumes [mean predicted volume 99 cc (31cc); GT volume 101 cc (33 cc), p=0.33]. Mean pancreatic volume difference was -2.7 cc (percent difference: -2.4% of GT volume) with excellent correlation between model-predicted and GT volumes [concordance correlation coefficient (CCC)=0.97]. In the external TCIA dataset, the model had higher reliability than R1 and R2 on full versus reduced dose CT scans [model mean (SD) DSC: 0.96 (0.02), CCC=0.995 versus R1 DSC: 0.83 (0.07), CCC=0.89, and R2 DSC:0.87 (0.04), CCC=0.97]. The DSC and volume concordance correlations for R1 versus R2 (inter-reader reliability) were 0.85 (0.07), CCC=0.90 at full-dose and 0.83 (0.07), CCC=0.96 at reduced dose datasets. There was good reliability between model and R1 at both full and reduced dose CT [Full dose: DSC: 0.81 (0.07), CCC=0.83 and reduced dose DSC:0.81 (0.08), CCC=0.87]. Likewise, there was good reliability between model and R2 at both full and reduced dose CT [Full dose: DSC: 0.84 (0.05), CCC=0.89 and reduced dose DSC:0.83(0.06), CCC=0.89]. There was no difference in model-predicted and GT pancreatic volume in TCIA dataset (mean predicted volume 96 cc (33); GT pancreatic volume 89 cc (30), p=0.31). Model had mean (SD) DSC: 0.89 (0.04) (minimum- maximum DSC: 0.79 -0.96) on the NIH-PCT dataset. CONCLUSION: A 3D-CNN developed on the largest dataset of CTs is accurate for fully automated volumetric pancreas segmentation and is generalizable across a wide-range of CT slice thicknesses, radiation dose and patient gender. This 3D-CNN offers a scalable tool to leverage biomarkers from pancreas morphometrics and radiomics for pancreatic diseases including for early pancreatic cancer detection.",nocancer
"Memory CD8+ T cells promote protective immunity against viruses or cancer. Our field has done a terrific job identifying how CD8+ T cell memory forms in response to Ag. However, many studies focused on systems in which inflammation recedes over time. These situations, while relevant, do not cover all situations in which CD8+ T cell memory is relevant. It is increasingly clear that CD8+ T cells with a memory phenotype form in response to infections with extensive or prolonged tissue inflammation, for example, influenza, herpes, and more recently, COVID-19. In these circumstances, inflammatory mediators expectedly affect forming memory CD8+ T cells, especially in tissues in which pathogens establish. Notwithstanding recent important discoveries, many outstanding questions on how inflammation shapes CD8+ T cell memory remain unanswered. We will discuss, in this review, what is already known and the next steps to understand how inflammation influences CD8+ T cell memory.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To compare the demographics and self-reported medical comorbidities of patients with vulvar lichen sclerosus (VLS) to those with other vulvar conditions. METHODS: Intake questionnaires for patients presenting to the University of Michigan Center for Vulvar Diseases between 1996 and 2019 were entered into a deidentified database (N=1983). Responses to questions about thyroid disease, urinary symptoms and signs, gastrointestinal conditions, and pain conditions were collected. RESULTS: 1983 subjects including 865 patients with VLS and 1118 patients without VLS were enrolled. Pearson Chi Square analysis showed that age, hypertension, anorectal fissures, peptic ulcer disease/gastroesophageal reflux disease (PUD/GERD), urinary incontinence, fibromyalgia, thyroid disease, kidney problems, liver problems and cancer were significantly associated with the VLS group when compared to the non-VLS groups (p<0.01). However, multiple regression analysis demonstrated that only age, thyroid disease, and anorectal fissures were strongly associated with VLS (p<0.01). CONCLUSION: Increasing age, thyroid disease and anorectal fissures were significantly associated with VLS. The association between anorectal fissures and VLS likely represents a sequala of the disease rather than a true co-morbidity.",nocancer
"Purpose While flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is a common clinical procedure used in the head and neck cancer (HNC) population, extant outcome measures for FEES such as bolus-level penetration-aspiration and residue scores are not well suited as global patient-level endpoint measures of dysphagia severity in cooperative group trials or clinical outcomes research. The Dynamic Imaging Grade of Swallowing Toxicity (DIGEST) was initially developed and validated for use during videofluoroscopic evaluations as a way to grade safety, efficiency, and overall pharyngeal swallowing impairment. The purpose of this study was to adapt and validate DIGEST for use with FEES. Method A modified Delphi exercise was conducted for content validation, expert consensus, adaptation, and operationalization of DIGEST-FEES. Three blinded, expert raters then evaluated 100 de-identified post-HNC treatment FEES examinations. Intra- and interrater reliability were tested with quadratic weighted kappa. Criterion validity against the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory, Functional Oral Intake Scale, Secretion Severity Scale, and Yale Residue Rating Scale was assessed with Spearman correlation coefficients. Results Interrater reliability was almost perfect for overall DIGEST-FEES grade (kappaw = 0.83) and safety grade (kappaw = 0.86) and substantial for efficiency grade (kappaw = 0.74). Intrarater reliability was excellent for all raters (0.9-0.91). Overall DIGEST-FEES grade correlated with MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (r = -.43, p < .0001), Functional Oral Intake Scale (r = -.43, p < .0001), Secretion Severity Scale (r = .47, p < .0001), Yale Vallecular Residue (r = .73, p < .0001), and Yale Pyriform Sinus Residue (r = .65, p < .0001). Conclusion DIGEST-FEES is a valid and reliable scale to describe the severity of pharyngeal dysphagia in patients with HNC. Supplemental Material https://doi.org/10.23641/asha.14642787.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: It was to systematically evaluate the effects of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and provide a theoretical basis for the clinical treatment of ARDS. METHODS: English databases of PubMed, Embase, Medline, Spring, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched, and the randomized controlled trial literatures on the treatment of ARDS patients with TCM published from January 1, 2001 to December 31, 2020 were screened. Then, Cochrane Handbook 5.0.2 was employed to evaluate the risk of bias in the included literatures, and Review Manager 5.3 was utilized for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies met the requirements and were included, with a total of 1,460 participants. The meta-analysis results showed that the mortality rate of patients in the observation group was remarkably reduced after treatment with TCM [mean deviation (MD) =0.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.32-0.84; Z=2.69; P=0.007]. The effective rate of clinical treatment was improved (MD =2.64; 95% CI: 1.79-3.90; Z=4.90; P<0.00001). Arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) increased remarkably (MD =12.29; 95% CI: 8.88-15.71; Z=7.05; P<0.00001). The oxygenation index (PaO2/FiO2) increased remarkably (MD =50.70; 95% CI: 32.78-68.63; Z=5.54; P<0.00001). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were remarkably reduced (MD =-8.32; 95% CI: -11.48 to -5.17; Z=5.17; P<0.00001). The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) decreased remarkably (MD =-9.23; 95% CI: -14.23 to -4.24; Z=3.62; P=0.0003). Compared with the control group, the above 8 analysis indicators showed statistically considerable differences. However, difference of partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) level (MD =-0.16; 95% CI: -2.97-2.65; Z=0.11; P=0.91) was not obvious between groups. DISCUSSION: The treatment of ARDS with TCM can reduce the mortality rate of patients, improves the effective rate of clinical treatment, reduces the average mechanical ventilation time, increases the levels of PaO2, PaO2/FiO2, and reduces the levels of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and CRP. The use of TCM has a significant treatment effect on ARDS.",nocancer
"IL-36 is a member of the interleukin 1 cytokine family, which is currently experiencing a renaissance due to the growing understanding of its context-dependent roles and advances in our understanding of the inflammatory response. The immunological role of IL-36 has revealed its profound and indispensable functional roles in psoriasis, as well as in several inflammatory diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and cancer. More recently, an increasing body of evidence suggests that IL-36 plays a crucial role in viral, bacterial and fungal infections. There is a growing interest as to whether IL-36 contributes to host protective immune responses against infection as well as the potential implications of IL-36 for the development of new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in understanding cellular expression, regulatory mechanisms and biological roles of IL-36 in infectious diseases, which suggest more specific strategies to maneuver IL-36 as a diagnostic or therapeutic target, especially in COVID-19.",nocancer
"Epigenetic regulation disorder is important in the onset and pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). SETD2, a trimethyltransferase of histone H3K36, is frequently mutated in IBD samples with a high risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, functions of SETD2 in IBD and colitis-associated CRC remain largely undefined. Here, we found that SETD2 modulates oxidative stress to attenuate colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis in mice. SETD2 expression became decreased in IBD patients and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitic mice. Setd2Vil-KO mice showed increased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis, accompanied by more severe epithelial barrier disruption and markedly increased intestinal permeability that subsequently facilitated inflammation-associated CRC. Mechanistically, we found that Setd2 depletion resulted in excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) by directly down-regulating antioxidant genes, which led to defects in barrier integrity and subsequently inflammatory damage. Moreover, overexpression of antioxidant PRDX6 in Setd2Vil-KO intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) largely alleviated the overproductions of ROS and improved the cellular survival. Together, our findings highlight an epigenetic mechanism by which SETD2 modulates oxidative stress to regulate intestinal epithelial homeostasis and attenuate colonic inflammation and tumorigenesis. SETD2 might therefore be a pivotal regulator that maintains the homeostasis of the intestinal mucosal barrier.",nocancer
"HDAC6 isoform selective inhibitors can be pursued as an alternative to pan-HDACs inhibitors due to their therapeutic effect and low toxicity. Efforts of the structure optimization of our previous compound 10c (IC50 = 4.4 nM) resulted in a new series of 3, 4-disubstituted-imidazolidine-2, 5-dione based HDAC6 inhibitors with better HDAC6 inhibitory activities and improved selectivities. The most potent compound 71 exhibited a low nanomolar HDAC6 inhibitory activity (IC50 = 2.1 nM) and showed 5545-fold, 5864-fold as well as 1638-fold selectivity relative to HDAC1, HDAC2 and HDAC8, respectively. Western blot analysis further confirmed that compound 71 selectively increased the acetylation level of alpha-tubulin without affecting histone H3. Moreover, compound 71 also possesses good properties in term of caspase-3 activation, apoptosis induction, anti-proliferative activity, cytotoxicity and plasma stability. Therefore, compound 71 can be applied in cancer therapy or used as a lead compound to develop more potent HDAC6 selective inhibitor.",nocancer
"Urinary diversion after cystectomy has been a historical standard for the treatment of numerous benign and malignant diseases of the bladder. Since the first published description in the early 1900s, improvements in surgical technique and a better understanding of the metabolic sequelae postoperatively have greatly enhanced patient outcomes. Both continent and incontinent diversions are available to patients after cystectomy. In appropriately selected patients, orthotopic neobladder reconstruction can offer preservation of body image and continence, and continent cutaneous diversions represent a reasonable alternative. Conduit diversion, which remains the most commonly performed diversion technique, is ideal for patients who would benefit from a less morbid surgical procedure that negates the need for self-catheterization. This installment of the Core Curriculum in Nephrology outlines numerous aspects of urinary diversion, in which a multidisciplinary approach to postoperative management at the intersection of nephrology and urology is required to effectively optimize patient outcomes. This article includes a discussion of the various reconstructive options after cystectomy as well as a comprehensive review of frequently encountered short-term and long-term metabolic abnormalities associated with altered electrolyte and acid-base homeostasis.",nocancer
"Nucleoli form around actively transcribed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes (rDNA), and the morphology and location of nucleolus-associated genomic domains (NADs) are linked to the RNA Polymerase I (Pol I) transcription status. The number of rDNA repeats (and the proportion of actively transcribed rRNA genes) is variable between cell types, individuals and disease state. Substantial changes in nucleolar morphology and size accompanied by concomitant changes in the Pol I transcription rate have long been documented during normal cell cycle progression, development and malignant transformation. This demonstrates how dynamic the nucleolar structure can be. Here, we will discuss how the structure of the rDNA loci, the nucleolus and the rate of Pol I transcription are important for dynamic regulation of global gene expression and genome stability, e.g., through the modulation of long-range genomic interactions with the suppressive NAD environment. These observations support an emerging paradigm whereby the rDNA repeats and the nucleolus play a key regulatory role in cellular homeostasis during normal development as well as disease, independent of their role in determining ribosome capacity and cellular growth rates.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged cancer care globally, introducing resource limitations and competing risks into clinical practice. AIMS: To describe the COVID-19 impact on medical oncology care provision in an Australian setting. METHODS: Calvary Mater Newcastle and Newcastle Private Hospital medical oncology data from 1 February to 31 April 2019 versus 2020 were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Three hundred and sixty-four inpatient admissions occurred in 2020, 21% less than in 2019. Total inpatient days decreased by 22% (2842 vs 2203). April was most impacted (36% and 44% fewer admissions and inpatient days respectively). Mean length of stay remained unchanged (6.4 vs 6.2 days, P = 0.7). In all, 5072 outpatient consultations were conducted, including 417 new-patient consultations (4% and 6% increase on 2019 respectively). Telephone consultations (0 vs 1380) replaced one-quarter of face-to-face consultations (4859 vs 3623, -25%), with minimal telehealth use (6 vs 69). Day Treatment Centre encounters remained stable (3751 vs 3444, -8%). The proportion of new patients planned for palliative treatment decreased (35% vs 28%, P = 0.04), observation increased (16% vs 23%, P = 0.04) and curative intent treatment was unchanged (both 41%). Recruiting clinical trials decreased by one-third (45 vs 30), two trials were activated (vs 5 in 2019) and 45% fewer patients consented to trial participation (62 vs 34). CONCLUSION: Our medical oncology teams adapted rapidly to COVID-19 with significant changes to care provision, including fewer hospital admissions, a notable transition to telephone-based outpatient clinics and reduced clinical trial activity. The continuum of care was largely defended despite pandemic considerations and growing service volumes.",nocancer
"53BP1 influences genome stability via two independent mechanisms: (1) regulating DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and (2) enhancing p53 activity. We discovered a protein, Tudor-interacting repair regulator (TIRR), that associates with the 53BP1 Tudor domain and prevents its recruitment to DSBs. Here, we elucidate how TIRR affects 53BP1 function beyond its recruitment to DSBs and biochemically links the two distinct roles of 53BP1. Loss of TIRR causes an aberrant increase in the gene transactivation function of p53, affecting several p53-mediated cell-fate programs. TIRR inhibits the complex formation between the Tudor domain of 53BP1 and a dimethylated form of p53 (K382me2) that is poised for transcriptional activation of its target genes. TIRR mRNA expression levels negatively correlate with the expression of key p53 target genes in breast and prostate cancers. Further, TIRR loss is selectively not tolerated in p53-proficient tumors. Therefore, we establish that TIRR is an important inhibitor of the 53BP1-p53 complex.",nocancer
"Postoperative hypocalcemia is a common complication of thyroidectomy. This problem is most often associated with accidental devascularisation or excision of the parathyroid glands (PG). Aim was study near-infrared fluorescent imaging with intraoperative parathyroid gland indocyanine green angiography to help identify and preserve parathyroid glands during total thyroidectomy in order to avoid postoperative hypocalcemia. For period from 2017 to 2019 years, 58 patients in Odessa regional hospital were underwent total thyroidectomy. Indications for surgery were multinodular goiter (n=42), thyroid cancer (n=11) and Graves' disease (n=5). By randomization all patients were divided into two groups: in the first group, 28 patients underwent standard total thyroidectomy, in the second group 30 patients underwent near-infrared-assisted total thyroidectomy with indocyanine green (ICG) angiography. Parathyroid autofluorescence was detected using a near infrared/indocyanine green endoscopic system (Karl Storz, Germany). Serum calcium and parathyroid hormone levels were compared between the two groups of patients in 1, 7 -15 days after surgery and then 3, 6 months later. In the first group, on based of a visual assessment of the PG, autotransplantation the PG were conduct in only 4 cases (in 3 cases - one gland, in one case - 2 glands). In the second group, autotransplantation was performed in 11 patients (in 8 cases - one gland, in 2 cases - two, in one case - 3). The transient postoperative hypocalcemia was observed in 5 patients of the first group (17,86%) and in the 2 patients of second group (6,67%) on 5-10 postoperative days. In the first group 1 patient at 3 months after surgery had permanent hypocalcemia. Near-infrared fluorescent imaging with intraoperative parathyroid gland indocyanine green angiography is a safe and an easily repeatable method. This technique provides improved detecting and assessment of the perfusion of the PG. The need for autotransplantation of the PG can be determined more objectively using ICG imaging than simple visualization.",nocancer
"The increased risk of thyroid cancer among individuals exposed during childhood and adolescence to Iodine-131 (131I) is the main statistically significant long-term effect of the Chornobyl accident. Several radiation epidemiological studies have been carried out or are currently in progress in Ukraine, to assess the risk of radiation-related health effects in exposed populations. About 150,000 measurements of 131I thyroid activity, so-called 'direct thyroid measurements', performed in May-June 1986 in the Ukrainian population served as the main sources of data used to estimate thyroid doses to the individuals of these studies. However, limitations in the direct thyroid measurements have been recently recognized including improper measurement geometry and unknown true values of calibration coefficients for unchecked thyroid detectors. In the present study, a comparative analysis of 131I thyroid activity measured by calibrated and unchecked devices in residents of the same neighboring settlements was conducted to evaluate the correct measurement geometry and calibration coefficients for measuring devices. As a result, revised values of 131I thyroid activity were obtained. On average, in Vinnytsia, Kyiv, Lviv and Chernihiv Oblasts and in the city of Kyiv, the revised values of the 131I thyroid activities were found to be 10-25% higher than previously reported, while in Zhytomyr Oblast, the values of the revised activities were found to be lower by about 50%. New sources of shared and unshared errors associated with estimates of 131I thyroid activity were identified. The revised estimates of thyroid activity are recommended to be used to develop an updated Thyroid Dosimetry system (TD20) for the entire population of Ukraine as well as to revise the thyroid doses for the individuals included in post-Chornobyl radiation epidemiological studies: the Ukrainian-American cohort of individuals exposed during childhood and adolescence, the Ukrainian in utero cohort and the Chornobyl Tissue Bank.",nocancer
"Ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) exerts pleiotropic effects on human skin. DNA damage response and repair pathways are activated by UVB; if damage cannot be repaired, apoptosis ensues. Although cumulative UVB exposure predisposes to skin cancer, UVB phototherapy is widely used as an effective treatment for psoriasis. Previous studies defined the therapeutic action spectrum of UVB and showed that psoriasis is resistant to apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate early molecular responses within psoriasis plaques following irradiation with single equi-erythemogenic doses of clinically-effective (311 nm, narrow-band) compared to clinically-ineffective (290 nm) UVB. Forty-eight micro-dissected epidermal samples from 20 psoriatic patients were analyzed using microarrays. Our bioinformatic analysis compared gene expression between 311 nm irradiated, 290 nm irradiated and control psoriasis epidermis to specifically identify 311 nm UVB differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their upstream regulatory pathways. Key DEGs and pathways were validated by immunohistochemical analysis. There was a dynamic induction and repression of 311 nm UVB DEGs between 6 h and 18 h, only a limited number of DEGs maintained their designated expression status between time-points. Key disease and function pathways included apoptosis, cell death, cell migration and leucocyte chemotaxis. DNA damage response pathways, NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response and P53 signalling were key nodes, interconnecting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Interferon signalling, dendritic cell maturation, granulocyte adhesion and atherosclerotic pathways were also differentially regulated. Consistent with these findings, top transcriptional regulators of 311 nm UVB DEGs related to: a) apoptosis, DNA damage response and cell cycle control; b) innate/acquired immune regulation and inflammation; c) hypoxia/redox response and angiogenesis; d) circadian rhythmicity; f) EGR/AP1 signalling and keratinocyte differentiation; and g) mitochondrial biogenesis. This research provides important insights into the molecular targets of 311 nm UVB, underscoring key roles for apoptosis and cell death. These and the other key pathways delineated may be central to the therapeutic effects of 311 nm in psoriasis.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Implementation of routinely collected patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) ensures patients' priorities are at the forefront of care planning and helps to standardise approaches to quality improvement. In palliative care, barriers to PROMs are widely known but what is not understood is the clinical and care settings in which patients are more likely to report and when proxy-reporting is needed. AIM: To examine the incidence of patient-reported symptom distress compared to the incidence of proxy reporting in palliative care, and influencing factors. METHODS: A national observational study using routinely collected PROMs data with influencing factors investigated by logistic regression modelling. Participants were patients with an advanced life-limiting illness receiving palliative care in an inpatient or a community healthcare setting in Australia. RESULTS: 16,158 reports of symptom distress were collected from 1,117 patients seen by 21 palliative care services. The majority of respondents were diagnosed with cancer (76%), were older (>=65 years, 72%), and had nominated English as their first language (88%). The majority of symptom distress reports were completed by patients (61%). Patients were more likely to self-report when receiving community versus inpatient palliative care (OR: 3.0; 95% CI 2.25-4.01), for patients diagnosed with malignant versus non-malignant disease (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.26-2.31), and for those who required an urgent change in their care plan versus those whose symptoms and problems were adequately managed (OR: 1.38; 95% CI 1.04-1.83). CONCLUSION: Three factors are associated with an increased likelihood of patient versus proxy reporting in palliative care: healthcare setting, diagnosis, and the acuity and urgency of the patient's clinical needs. PROMs are feasible in most clinical scenarios in palliative care, including when an urgent clinical response is required.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Autologous fat transfer (AFT) has already become a part of clinical practice for aesthetic breast augmentation, even though evidence regarding its efficacy is still lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine the current worldwide status and efficacy, techniques, and oncologic safety on this subject. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to identify all relevant studies. RESULTS: Eighty-four articles published between 1987 and April 2020, consisting of 6468 patients, were included, and 64 studies consisting of 5162 unique patients were included in the meta-analysis. Most studies had a low level of evidence (levels 2b-5); In this meta-analysis, there were 17 prospective cohort studies, four retrospective cohort studies, six case-control studies, and 38 case series. The publications were from 21 countries. Indications for autologous fat transplantation were aesthetic augmentation (93.2%) and congenital malformation (6.8%). Among the 5162 patients, two cases (0.04%) of cancer were reported. The meta-analysis revealed very high overall patient and surgeon satisfaction rates of 93% and 87%, respectively. Overall, only 1.56 sessions were needed to achieve the desired result. Long-term survival was calculated to be about 60-70% at 1-year follow-up. Only 8% of procedures resulted in clinical complications, and 5% of patients required biopsy because of abnormal clinical or radiological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Autologous fat transplantation seems to be a major tool in aesthetic breast augmentation. Preoperative patient selection is essential but under-reported. Future research should focus on evaluating the technical and patient factors influencing the rate of fat survival and its oncological safety.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Immune activation and inflammation are hallmarks of chronic HIV infection and are etiologically linked to major causes of morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected persons, including coronary artery disease and cancer. Systemic immune activation is dampened, but not resolved, with use of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Statins are cardioprotective drugs that also appear to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. We sought to understand the association between statin use, cART, and levels of circulating immune markers in a longitudinal cohort study. METHODS: From 2004-2009, statin use was ascertained in male participants of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) using interviewer-administered questionnaires. Twenty-four circulating markers of immune activation and inflammation were measured in archived serial samples from a subset of cohort members using multiplex assays. Propensity-adjusted generalized gamma models were used to compare biomarkers' distributions by statin use, and multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the effect of initiating statin on these biomarkers. RESULTS: Overall, 1,031 cART-exposed individuals with HIV infection were included in this study. Statin use was reported by 31.5% of cART-exposed participants. Compared to non-statin users on cART, statin users on cART had lower levels of IP-10, IL-10 and IL-12p70, and the effect of statin use was decreased in participants using lipophilic statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, or lovastatin); these results were statistically significant (p<0.05). Among cART users not on aspirin, starting statins decreased levels of hsCRP, IL-12p70, and IL-6. CONCLUSION: Statin therapy is associated with reduced levels of certain biomarkers of immune activation and inflammation in cART users, which may contribute to a lower burden of disease.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have reported T cell immunity to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in unexposed donors, possibly due to cross-recognition by T-cells specific for common cold coronaviruses (CCCs). True T-cell cross-reactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: We used the ViraFEST platform to identify T cell responses cross-reactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC cross-reactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system. RESULTS: Memory CD4+ T-cell clonotypes that cross-recognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Cross-reactive T-cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to mono-specific CD4+ T-cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS CoV-2 relative to CCC. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, our data confirm the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes cross-recognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of cross-reactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that pre-existing CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these cross-reactive T-cell responses impact clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.",nocancer
"Malaria remains one of the leading causes of death in sub-Saharan Africa, ranked in the top three infectious diseases in the world. Plants of the Eriosema genus have been reported to be used for the treatment of this disease, but scientific evidence is still missing for some of them. In the present study, the in vitro antiplasmodial activity of the crude extract and compounds from Eriosema montanum Baker f. roots were tested against the 3D7 strain of Plasmodium falciparum and revealed using the SYBR Green, a DNA intercalating compound. The cytotoxicity effect of the compounds on a human cancer cell line (THP-1) was assessed to determine their selectivity index. It was found that the crude extract of the plant displayed a significant antiplasmodial activity with an IC50 (microg/mL) = 17.68 +- 4.030 and a cytotoxic activity with a CC50 (microg/mL) = 101.5 +- 12.6, corresponding to a selective antiplasmodial activity of 5.7. Bioactivity-guided isolation of the major compounds of the roots' crude extract afforded seven compounds, including genistein, genistin and eucomic acid. Under our experimental conditions, using Artemisinin as a positive control, eucomic acid showed the best inhibitory activity against the P. falciparum 3D7, a well-known chloroquine-sensitive strain. The present results provide a referential basis to support the traditional use of Eriosema species in the treatment of malaria.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm is high in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) population. Emphysema involves proteolytic destruction of elastic fibers. Therefore, emphysema may also contribute to thoracic aorta dilatation. This study assessed aorta dilation in smokers stratified by presence of COPD, emphysema and airway thickening. METHODS: Aorta diameters were measured on 3D magnetic resonance angiography in smokers recruited from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), the Emphysema and Cancer Action Project (EMCAP), and the local community. COPD was defined by standard spirometric criteria; emphysema was measured quantitatively on computed tomography and bronchitis was determined from medical history. RESULTS: Participants (n = 315, age 58-79) included 150 with COPD and 165 without COPD, of whom 56% and 19%, respectively, had emphysema. Subjects in the most severe quartile of emphysematous change showed the largest diameter at all four aorta locations compared to those in the least severe quartiles (all p < 0.001). Comparing subjects with and without COPD, aorta diameters were larger in participants with severe COPD in ascending and arch (both p < 0.001), and abdominal aorta (p = 0.001). Chronic bronchitis and bronchial wall thickness did not correlate with aorta diameter. In subjects with emphysema, subjects with coexistence of COPD showed larger aorta than those without COPD in ascending (p = 0.003), arch (p = 0.002), and abdominal aorta (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed larger aorta diameter in subjects with COPD and severe emphysema compared to COPD related to chronic bronchitis or bronchial wall thickening.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND/AIM: Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) plays an important role in cancer localization in ectopic Cushing's syndrome (ECS). However, the choice of the optimal tracer for investigation of this disease is still unclear. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic feasibility of [18F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose ([18F]FDG), [18F]fluoro-L-dihydroxyphenylalanine ([18F] FDOPA), and [68Ga]-DOTA-1-Nal3-octreotide ([68Ga]-DOTANOC) in ECS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All PET/CT scans of patients admitted to our department for suspected ECS between 2010 and 2020 were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: Collectively, 30 PET/CT examinations, 11 with [18F]FDOPA, 11 with [18F]FDG and 8 with [68Ga]GaDOTANOC were conducted for 18 patients eligible for analysis. [18F]FDG detected the tumour in 3/6 of the cases, [18F]FDOPA in 3/4, and [68Ga]GaDOTANOC in 3/3. [18F]FDOPA was the only tracer without false positive results. CONCLUSION: [68Ga]GaDOTANOC and [18F]FDOPA showed superior results compared to [18F]FDG, although the sensitivity of the tracers might be influenced by the aetiology of the tumour underlying the ECS.",nocancer
"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signalling molecules in many physiological processes, yet excess ROS leads to cell damage and can lead to pathology. Accordingly, cells need to maintain tight regulation of ROS levels, and ROS-responsive transcriptional reprogramming is central to this process. Although it has long been recognized that oxidative stress leads to rapid, significant changes in gene expression, the impact of oxidative stress on the underlying chromatin accessibility landscape remained unclear. Here, we asked whether ROS-responsive transcriptional reprogramming is accompanied by reprogramming of the chromatin environment in MCF7 human breast cancer cells. Using a time-course exposure to multiple inducers of oxidative stress, we determined that the widespread ROS-responsive changes in gene expression induced by ROS occur with minimal changes to the chromatin environment. While we did observe changes in chromatin accessibility, these changes were: (1) far less numerous than gene expression changes after oxidative stress, and (2) occur within pre-existing regions of accessible chromatin. TF footprinting analysis of our ATAC-seq experiments identified 5 TFs or TF families with evidence for ROS-responsive changes in DNA binding: NRF2, AP-1, p53, NFY, and SP/KLF. Importantly, several of these (AP-1, NF-Y, and SP/KLF factors) have not been previously implicated as widespread regulators in the response to ROS. In summary, we have characterized genome-wide changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in response to ROS treatment of MCF7 cells, and we have found that regulation of the large-scale transcriptional response to excess ROS is primarily constrained by the cell's pre-existing chromatin landscape.",nocancer
"The CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain cautioned against high dose prescribing but did not provide guidance on type of opioid for new pain episodes. We determined if new prescriptions for Schedule II opioids vs. tramadol decreased in the 18 months after vs. before the CDC guideline and if this decrease was associated with physician specialty. New opioid prescriptions, provider type and covariates were measured using a nationally distributed, Optum  de-identified Electronic Health Record (EHR) data base. Eligible patients were free of cancer and HIV and started a new prescription for Schedule II opioids (i.e. codeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone) or Schedule IV (tramadol) in the 18 months before (n = 141,219) or 18 months after (n = 138,216) guideline publication. Fully adjusted multilevel multinomial models estimated the association between provider type (anesthesiology/pain medicine, surgical specialty, emergency, hospital, primary care, other specialty and unknown) before and after adjusting for covariates. New oxycodone prescriptions were most common among surgical and anesthesia/pain management, and new tramadol prescriptions were most common in primary care. The greatest decreases in odds of a Schedule II opioid vs. tramadol were observed in emergency care (oxycodone vs. tramadol OR = 0.82; 95%CI:0.76-0.88) and primary care (hydrocodone vs. tramadol OR = 0.85; 95%CI:0.81-0.89). Surgical specialists were least likely to start opioid therapy with tramadol. In the 18 months after vs. before the CDC guideline, emergency care and primary care providers increased tramadol prescribing. Guidelines tailored to specialists that frequently begin opioid therapy with oxycodone may enhance safe opioid prescribing.",nocancer
"As one of the most common complications of diabetes, nephropathy develops in approximately 40% of diabetic individuals. Although end stage kidney disease is known as one of the most consequences of diabetic nephropathy, the majority of diabetic individuals might die from cardiovascular diseases and infections before renal replacement treatment. Moreover, the routine medical treatments for diabetes hold undesirable side effects. The explosive prevalence of diabetes urges clinicians and scientists to investigate the complementary or alternative therapies. Phytochemicals are emerging as alternatives with a wide range of therapeutic effects on various pathologies, including diabetic kidney disease. Of those phytochemicals, resveratrol, a natural polyphenolic stilbene, has been found to exert a broad spectrum of health benefits via various signaling molecules. In particular, resveratrol has gained a great deal of attention because of its anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, cardiovascular-protective, and anti-tumor properties. In the renal system, emerging evidence shows that resveratrol has already been used to ameliorate chronic or acute kidney injury. This review critically summarizes the current findings and molecular mechanisms of resveratrol in diabetic renal damage. In addition, we will discuss the adverse and inconsistent effects of resveratrol in diabetic nephropathy. Although there is increasing evidence that resveratrol affords great potential in diabetic nephropathy therapy, these results should be treated with caution before its clinical translation. In addition, the unfavorable pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics profiles, such as poor bioavailability, may limit its extensive clinical applications. It is clear that further research is needed to unravel these limitations and improve its efficacy against diabetic nephropathy. Increasing investigation of resveratrol in diabetic kidney disease will not only help us better understand its pharmacological actions, but also provide novel potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has recently been identified as the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent response for novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to explore the roles of ACE2, apelin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) in SARS-CoV-2-mediated cardiorenal damage. METHODS AND RESULTS: The published RNA-sequencing datasets of cardiomyocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 patients were used. String, UMAP plots and single cell RNA sequencing data were analyzed to show the close relationship and distinct cardiorenal distribution patterns of ACE2, apelin and SGLT2. Intriguingly, there were decreases in ACE2 and apelin expression as well as marked increases in SGLT2 and endothelin-1 levels in SARS-CoV-2-infected cardiomyocytes, animal models with diabetes, acute kidney injury, heart failure and COVID-19 patients. These changes were linked with downregulated levels of interleukin (IL)-10, superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase as well as upregulated expression of profibrotic genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Genetic ACE2 deletion resulted in upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines containing IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-17 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. More importantly, dapagliflozin strikingly alleviated cardiorenal fibrosis in diabetic db/db mice by suppressing SGLT2 levels and potentiating the apelin-ACE2 signaling. CONCLUSION: Downregulation of apelin and ACE2 and upregulation of SGLT2, endothelin-1 and proinflammatory cytokines contribute to SARS-CoV-2-mediated cardiorenal injury, indicating that the apelin-ACE2 signaling and SGLT2 inhibitors are potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19 patients.",nocancer
"Objective: To evaluate the safety of peficitinib for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in Asian patients.Methods: Safety data from one Phase 2b, two Phase 3, and one open-label long-term extension study [data cut-off May 31, 2018] were pooled into Phase 3 studies (peficitinib 100 and 150 mg/day, and placebo) and Phase 2/3 studies (all peficitinib-treated patients). Incidence rates per 100 patient-years (PY) of adverse events (AEs) of special interest were calculated.Results: Overall, 1,052 patients received peficitinib for 2,336.3 PY of exposure (median 2.1 years); 4 deaths occurred, including 1 death after the studies. AE incidence was similar across peficitinib 100 and 150 mg/day groups (Phase 3 studies). Respective peficitinib and placebo incidence rates (95% confidence interval) per 100 PY were 2.9 (1.9, 4.6) and 0.0 for serious infections, 5.7 (4.2, 7.9) and 2.3 (0.6, 9.4) for herpes zoster-related disease, and 0.6 (0.2, 1.6) and 1.2 (0.2, 8.3) for malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) (Phase 3 studies), and 0.1 (0.0, 0.3) for venous thromboembolism in all peficitinib-treated patients (Phase 2/3 studies).Conclusions: Peficitinib was well tolerated in Asian patients with RA over a median of 2 years, with no observed dose or temporal dependency for AEs with prolonged administration.",nocancer
"Increased maternal inflammatory response has been noted in women with pregnancies complicated by preterm birth and small-for-gestational age infants. However, the association between gestational exposure to air pollutants, maternal inflammatory response, and fetal growth remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the association between exposure to air pollutants during pregnancy and the concentration of inflammatory indicators in maternal and fetal circulations, as well as fetal growth. We recruited 108 healthy pregnant women living in northern (n=55) and southern (n=53) areas of Taiwan and prospectively collected information of exposure to outdoor air pollutants throughout gestation. Maternal blood from each trimester and umbilical cord blood after delivery were collected and analyzed for inflammatory indicators including high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Our results showed that exposure to particulate matter less than or equal to 10 micrometers (PM10) and ozone (O3) during the first trimester had a direct effect on reduction of birth weight, but the direct effect of PM10 mediated by hs-CRP and the direct effect of O3 mediated by TNF-alpha on fetal birth weight were not significant.. Exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 during the second and third trimesters also directly affected birth weight. Furthermore, exposure to sulfur dioxide (SO2) caused changes in the concentrations of TNF-alpha in maternal blood during the second trimester, which subsequently resulted in reduced fetal weight. Together, these results indicate that exposure to air pollutants may cause both direct and indirect effects on the reduction of fetal weight.",nocancer
"Identifying the nature and extent of atmospheric PM2.5-bound toxic organic pollutants is beneficial to evaluate human health risks of air pollution. Seasonal observations of PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitro-PAHs (NPAHs) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) were investigated, along with criteria air pollutants and meteorological parameters. With the elevated PM2.5 level, the percentage of 4-ring PAHs and typical NPAH including 3-Nitrobiphenyl (3-NBP) and 2-Nitrofluoranthene (2-NFLT) increased by 19-40%. PM2.5-bound 2-NFLT was positively correlated with O3 and NO2, suggesting the contribution of atmospheric oxidation capacity to enhance the secondary formation of NPAHs in the atmosphere. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis indicated that traffic emissions (44.9-48.7%), coal and biomass combustion (27.6-36.0%) and natural gas and volatilization (15.3-27.5%) were major sources of PAHs, and secondary formation (39.8-53.8%) was a predominant contributor to total NPAH concentrations. Backward trajectory analysis showed that air masses from North China transported to the YRD region increased PAH and NPAH concentrations. Compare to clean days, the BaP equivalent concentrations of total PAHs and NPAHs during haze pollution days were enhanced by 10-25 and 2-6 times, respectively. The Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risks (ILCRs) of PAHs by inhalation exposure also indicated high potential health risks in the YRD region. The results implied that the health risks of PM2.5-bound PAHs and NPAHs could be sharply enhanced with the increase of PM2.5 concentrations.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Cronobacter sakazakii is an opportunistic Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium which may be a causative agent of meningitis in premature infants and enterocolitis and bacteremia in neonates and adults. While there have been multiple cases of C. sakazakii infections, there have been no acute cholangitis cases reported in humans. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old male with a past medical history of basal cell carcinoma, alcoholic liver cirrhosis, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure, complicated by staphylococcus bacteremia, pituitary tumor, glaucoma, and hypothyroidism presented to the emergency room with the complaint of diffuse and generalized 10/10 abdominal pain of 1 day's duration. There was a concern for pancreatitis, acute cholangitis, and possible cholecystitis, and the patient underwent a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube placement. Blood cultures from admission and biliary fluid cultures both grew C. sakazakii. The patient was treated with a carbapenem and clinically improved. CONCLUSIONS: The case study described a patient with multiple medical comorbidities that presented with C. sakazakii bacteremia and cholangitis. While this bacterium has been implicated in other infections, we believe this is the first time the bacteria is being documented to have caused acute cholangitis.",nocancer
"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects 2-3% of the population worldwide. It is associated with plaques, psoriatic arthritis, and metabolic syndrome and its components, including obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. In this review, we highlight the shared pathogenic pathways leading to the comorbid existence of both diseases and the impact of drugs used for psoriasis on metabolic syndrome and vice versa. Persistent inflammation is common to both diseases. They share increased inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin-6. Biologics have revolutionized the treatment of plaque psoriasis and also have a positive impact on metabolic syndrome. There is some evidence that TNFalpha inhibitors decrease insulin resistance and improve glycemic indices. Some psoriasis treatments may result in decreased body weight. Lifestyle measures used in the management of metabolic syndrome, such as weight loss, exercise, and healthy diet, are beneficial in patients with psoriasis. Considering the association between metabolic syndrome and psoriasis, we recommend screening patients with psoriasis for metabolic syndrome with clinical examinations and laboratory tests. Patients with a co-diagnosis of these diseases deserve special attention for optimal treatment.",nocancer
"Calcifying pseudoneoplasm of the neuraxis (CAPNON) is a rare tumor-like lesion with unclear pathogenesis. Collision lesions of CAPNONs with neoplasms are occasionally reported. In this article, we report the first case of collision lesions between CAPNON and rheumatoid nodules (RNs) in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient was a 51-year-old female who presented with lower back pain and subsequently a lower back mass over 2 years. Spinal magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a heterogeneous, partially calcified mass centered in the L3-4 paravertebral regions. A biopsy of the mass was diagnostic of CAPNON. As the mass grew over the following 5 months, it was resected en bloc. Its pathological examination revealed collision lesions of RNs at different histopathological stages and CAPNON lesions, and transitional lesions exhibiting combined RN and CAPNON features, with immune cell infiltrates. Our findings provide new evidence for an immune-mediated reactive process and insights into the pathogenies of CAPNON.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Exercise training, which is incorporated both goal-based training such as task-oriented training (TOT) and aerobic training (AT), has been suggested to induce neuroprotection. However, molecular mechanisms which may underlie exercise-induced neuroprotection are still largely unknown. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of TOT combined with AT (TOT-AT) on serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived growth factor (GDNF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels in people with PD (PwPD). METHODS: Forty PwPD were randomized into 8-week of either exercise group (n = 20) or control group (n = 20). The exercise group received TOT-AT while the control group received only AT. Serum BDNF, GDNF, IGF-1, VEGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta levels determined with ELISA were assessed at baseline and after training. RESULTS: A total of 29 PwPD completed this study. Our results showed no significant change in the serum BDNF, GDNF, IGF-1, VEGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta levels in both groups. After the intervention period, no significant difference was observed between the groups regarding the serum BDNF, GDNF, IGF-1, VEGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta levels. CONCLUSION: TOT-AT could not be an effective exercise method for changing serum concentrations of BDNF, GDNF, IGF-1, VEGF, TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in the rehabilitation of PD.",nocancer
"Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and lung cancer are both caused by smoking and often occur as comorbidity. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis is an important canonic immunoregulatory pathway and antibodies that specifically block PD-1 or PD-L1 have demonstrated efficacy as therapeutic agents for non-small cell lung cancer. The role of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in the pathogenesis of COPD is unknown. Here, we analyzed the function of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in preclinical COPD models and evaluated the concentrations of PD-1 and PD-L1 in human serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids as biomarkers for COPD. Anti-PD-1 treatment decreased lung damage and neutrophilic inflammation in mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) or Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Ex vivo stimulated macrophages obtained from anti-PD-1 treated mice released reduced amounts of inflammatory cytokines. PD-L1 concentrations correlated positively with PD-1 concentrations in human serum and BAL fluids. Lung sections obtained from COPD patients stained positive for PD-L1. Our data indicate that the PD-1/PD-L1 axis is involved in developing inflammation and tissue destruction in COPD. Inflammation-induced activation of the PD-1 pathway may contribute to disease progression.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is known to be a risk factor of pneumonia after esophagectomy. In this study, we investigated the relationship of airflow limitation with the occurrence and the severity of pneumonia in esophageal cancer patients who underwent esophagectomy. METHODS: We enrolled 844 patients who underwent curative esophagectomy between 2009 and 2018. The airflow limitation was evaluated using the percent-predicted forced expiratory volume at 1 s (%FEV1) with spirometry. RESULTS: There were 597 (70.7%), 141 (16.7%), 68 (8.1%), and 38 patients (4.5%) with %FEV1 of >= 90%, 80-90%, 70-80%, and < 70% categories, respectively. One hundred and ninety-one patients (22.6%) occurred pneumonia, and the incidences of pneumonia in each category of patients were 18.8%, 28.4%, 29.4%, and 50.0%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the categories of 80%-90%, 70-80%, and < 70% were significantly associated with a higher incidence of postoperative pneumonia (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.02-2.43, OR 1.87; 95% CI 1.04-3.36, OR 3.34; 95% CI 1.66-6.71, respectively), with the %FEV1 category of >= 90% as reference. The incidence of severe pneumonia of Clavien-Dindo grade III or higher was also significantly associated with the %FEV1. In patients without COPD, the incidence of pneumonia was significantly higher in those with %FEV1 < 90% than in those with %FEV1 >= 90% (32.2% versus 17.5%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The airflow limitation can help predict the occurrence of pneumonia after esophagectomy in patients with and without COPD. Exclusive preventive measures should be considered in patients with reduced %FEV1 undergoing esophagectomy.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Opioid use for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is under debate. In the absence of pan-European guidance on this issue, a position paper was commissioned by the European Pain Federation (EFIC). METHODS: The clinical practice recommendations were developed by eight scientific societies and one patient self-help organization under the coordination of EFIC. A systematic literature search in MEDLINE (up until January 2020) was performed. Two categories of guidance are given: Evidence-based recommendations (supported by evidence from systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials or of observational studies) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) statements (supported either by indirect evidence or by case-series, case-control studies and clinical experience). The GRADE system was applied to move from evidence to recommendations. The recommendations and GCP statements were developed by a multiprofessional task force (including nursing, service users, physicians, physiotherapy and psychology) and formal multistep procedures to reach a set of consensus recommendations. The clinical practice recommendations were reviewed by five external reviewers from North America and Europe and were also posted for public comment. RESULTS: The European Clinical Practice Recommendations give guidance for combination with other medications, the management of frequent (e.g. nausea, constipation) and rare (e.g. hyperalgesia) side effects, for special clinical populations (e.g. children and adolescents, pregnancy) and for special situations (e.g. liver cirrhosis). CONCLUSION: If a trial with opioids for chronic noncancer pain is conducted, detailed knowledge and experience are needed to adapt the opioid treatment to a special patient group and/or clinical situation and to manage side effects effectively. SIGNIFICANCE: If a trial with opioids for chronic noncancer pain is conducted, detailed knowledge and experience are needed to adapt the opioid treatment to a special patient group and/or clinical situation and to manage side effects effectively.

"PURPOSE: To train and validate a predictive model of mortality for hospitalized COVID-19 patients based on lung densitometry. METHODS: Two-hundred-fifty-one patients with respiratory symptoms underwent CT few days after hospitalization. ""Aerated"" (AV), ""consolidated"" (CV) and ""intermediate"" (IV) lung sub-volumes were quantified by an operator-independent method based on individual HU maximum gradient recognition. AV, CV, IV, CV/AV, IV/AV, and HU of the first peak position were extracted. Relevant clinical parameters were prospectively collected. The population was composed by training (n = 166) and validation (n = 85) consecutive cohorts, and backward multi-variate logistic regression was applied on the training group to build a CT_model. Similarly, models including only clinical parameters (CLIN_model) and both CT/clinical parameters (COMB_model) were developed. Model's performances were assessed by goodness-of-fit (H&L-test), calibration and discrimination. Model's performances were tested in the validation group. RESULTS: Forty-three patients died (25/18 in training/validation). CT_model included AVmax (i.e. maximum AV between lungs), CV and CV/AE, while CLIN_model included random glycemia, C-reactive protein and biological drugs (protective). Goodness-of-fit and discrimination were similar (H&L:0.70 vs 0.80; AUC:0.80 vs 0.80). COMB_model including AVmax, CV, CV/AE, random glycemia, biological drugs and active cancer, outperformed both models (H&L:0.91; AUC:0.89, 95%CI:0.82-0.93). All models showed good calibration (R2:0.77-0.97). Despite several patient's characteristics were different between training and validation cohorts, performances in the validation cohort confirmed good calibration (R2:0-70-0.81) and discrimination for CT_model/COMB_model (AUC:0.72/0.76), while CLIN_model performed worse (AUC:0.64). CONCLUSIONS: Few automatically extracted densitometry parameters with clear functional meaning predicted mortality of COVID-19 patients. Combined with clinical features, the resulting predictive model showed higher discrimination/calibration.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Large healthcare systems provide an opportunity to disseminate evidence-based interventions to primary care. We evaluated the impact of a train-the-trainer model in two large systems to disseminate the Announcement Approach Training, which teaches providers to communicate about HPV vaccination more effectively. METHODS: In collaboration with the American Cancer Society, we partnered with two midwestern healthcare systems that served over 77,000 patients ages 11 through 17. Both systems hosted a 2-hour train-the-trainer workshop. Providers from one system then conducted in-person 1-hour CME-eligible trainings, using our standard slide set and script (available at hpvIQ.org). The other system did not implement trainings, providing a natural experiment. RESULTS: The train-the-trainer workshop included physicians, nurses and other clinical staff (n = 11/13 for intervention/comparison systems). The intervention system delivered 18 trainings to 234 physicians, nurses, and other clinic staff. From baseline to 6-month follow-up, the intervention system had an increase in HPV vaccine uptake that was larger than that of the comparison system for adolescents ages 11 through 12 (1.9%, p = .002) and ages 13 through 17 (1.5%, p = .015). Attending the training was associated with increased intentions to routinely recommend HPV vaccine when patients turn 11 or 12 (mean 4.19 (SD = 0.95) vs. 4.43 (SD = 0.83) as well as increased positive vaccine attitudes, self-efficacy, and norms (all p < .001). Participant satisfaction with the trainings was high (90%-94%). CONCLUSION: The train-the-trainer model was effective in increasing provider motivation to recommend HPV vaccination and led to a small increase in vaccine uptake. Dissemination through large healthcare systems is promising but faces some challenges.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Screening for problematic opioid use is increasingly recommended in patients receiving palliative care. AIM: To identify tools used to assess for the presence or risk of problematic opioid use in palliative care. DESIGN: Scoping review. DATA SOURCES: Bibliographic databases (inception to January 31, 2020), reference lists, and grey literature were searched to find primary studies reporting on adults receiving palliative care and prescription opioids to manage symptoms from advanced cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, or end-stage organ diseases; and included tools to assess for problematic opioid use. There were no restrictions based on study design, location, or language. RESULTS: We identified 42 observational studies (total 14,431 participants) published between 2009 and 2020 that used questionnaires (n = 32) and urine drug tests (n = 21) to assess for problematic opioid use in palliative care, primarily in US (n = 38) and outpatient palliative care settings (n = 36). The questionnaires were Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-opener (CAGE, n = 8), CAGE-Adapted to Include Drugs (CAGE-AID, n = 6), Opioid Risk Tool (n = 9), Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP; n = 3), SOAPP-Revised (n = 2), and SOAPP-Short Form (n = 5). Only two studies' primary objectives were to evaluate a questionnaire's psychometric properties in patients receiving palliative care. There was wide variation in how urine drug tests were incorporated into palliative care; frequency of abnormal urine drug test results ranged from 8.6% to 70%. CONCLUSION: Given the dearth of studies using tools developed or validated specifically for patients receiving palliative care, further research is needed to inform clinical practice and policy regarding problematic opioid use in palliative care.",nocancer
"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) is an important clinically tested cytokine that could induce autoimmune diseases and inflammation. Therefore, the anti-TNF-alpha therapy strategy was developed and used therapeutically in various diseases, especially in the cytokine storm associated chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy and antiviral therapy. Compare with other anti-TNF-alpha inhibitors, anti-TNF-alpha Nb (nanobody) has many unique advantages. Herein, we reported a novel humanized scaffold for library construction, which could be soluble and expressed in Escherichia coli (E.coli), and the efficiency capacity could reach as high as 2.01 x 109. Meanwhile, an anti-TNF-alpha Nb was selected for further study after 4 rounds of screening, NT-3, as the optimal Nb could effectively inhibit TNF-mediated cytotoxicity. The IC50 of NT-3 was determined as 0.804 muM, and its apoptosis inhibition rate was 62.47 % in L929 cells. Furthermore, the molecular docking results showed that complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of NT-3 could connect to TNF for blocking function through strong hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. In general, our study not only provided a good Nb screening platform in vitro without animal immunization, but also generated a series of novel humanized anti-TNF-alpha Nb candidates with potential applications.",nocancer
"Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is a disorder that affects the kidneys and other organs, and its major forms are encoded by polycystin-1 (PC1) and polycystin-2 (PC2), as PKD1 and PKD2. It is located sandwiched inside and outside cell membranes and interacts with other cells. This protein is most active in kidney cells before birth, and PC1 and PC2 work together to help regulate cell proliferation, cell migration, and interactions with other cells. The molecular relationship and the function between PKD1 and cancer is well known, such as increased or decreased cell proliferation and promoting or suppressing cell migration depending on the cancer cell type specifically. However, its function in stem cells has not been revealed. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the biological function of PC1 and umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell (UCB-MSC). Furthermore, we assessed how it affects cell migration, proliferation, and the viability of cells when expressed in the PKD1 gene. In addition, we confirmed in an ex vivo artificial tooth model generated by the three-dimension printing technique that the ability to differentiate into osteocytes improved according to the expression level of the stemness markers when PKD1 was expressed. This study is the first report to examine the biological function of PKD1 in UCB-MSC. This gene may be capable of enhancing differentiation ability and maintaining long-term stemness for the therapeutic use of stem cells.",nocancer
"To assess whether smoking and obesity are predictors of poor treatment response in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). A systematic literature review was performed by searching in MEDLINE and EMBASE up to June 2019 with a strategy based on the PICO approach: Population: patients with axSpA; Intervention or exposure: smoking or obesity; Comparison: non-smokers (for smoking) and normal-weight individuals (for obesity); and Outcome: any response criteria currently validated for axSpA. The 2009 Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine levels were used for assessing the studies quality. Out of 1873 references retrieved, 46 studies were selected for full-text review and 12 for data extraction: six stratified patients by smoking and six by obesity. All were longitudinal observational studies, except one, which was cross-sectional. Overall, these studies included 5291 patients (3917 for smoking and 1333 for obesity), and all these patients were on anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy. The quality of evidence was graded as level 2b except that from the cross-sectional study which was graded level 4. For smoking, the evidence found is inconsistent: two studies finding negative effects in response to anti-TNF while the other four found no differences in clinical response to this therapy. Regarding obesity, the evidence is more consistent: five of the six studies describing a negative influence in response to anti-TNF. According to the scientific evidence in patients with axSpA, obesity is associated with a more unsatisfactory response to anti-TNF therapy. A poorer response in smokers has yet to be demonstrated. Key Points   Identifying predictors of treatment response in axSpA, especially those that are modifiable, is relevant.   Obesity increases the risk of poorer response to anti-TNF agents in patients with axSpA.   Scientific evidence for smoking habit as a predictor of treatment response in axSpA is inconclusive.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Fangcang Hospitals (cabin hospitals) played a key role in isolation and control of the infection sources during COVID-19 epidemic. Many patients at Fangcang Hospitals had complications or mental stress. As the doctors, nurses and paramedics presented in the emergency, there was a growing demand for clinical pharmacists to provide pharmaceutical care for the affected patients with chronic diseases via telemedicine. OBJECTIVE: This study was a retrospective study to evaluate the usefulness of clinical prevention and control measures of clinical pharmacists at Jianghan Fangcang Hospital. Besides, this study proposed innovative strategies for developing pharmacy services to ensure the medication compliance, accuracy, and cure rates under the epidemic. METHODS: A total of 374 patients filled in the questionnaires and 349 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients who refused to receive pharmaceutical care were not included in this study. The pharmaceutical care included medication education via broadcast station, medication reconciliation, optimization of drug use, monitor of adverse drug events, and psychological comfort via WeChat one-to-one service. The data was collected from patients' interviews and the questionnaires of inpatients and discharged patients. RESULTS: In Jianghan Fangcang Hosptial, many patients had complications with hypertension(12.9%), hyperlipidemia (9.2%), thyroid disease(8.9%), diabetes(7.2%), heart disease(3.4%), nephropathy(1.7%), cancer(1.1%) and other diseases(12.6%). After 35 days' pharmacy service, about 200 different questions had been solved by our clinical pharmacists, including drug usage (65.38%), medication reconciliation (55.13%), drug precautions (23.1%), adverse drug reactions (35.9%), and psychological counseling (32.05%). Most patients were satisfied with clinical pharmacist service(66.7%great, 18.0%good). CONCLUSION: The results of the retrospective study indicated that clinical pharmacist can effectively reduce and prevent drug-related, life-related and COVID-19-related problems for COVID-19 patients, which is important for the disease recovery. This study also demonstrated that clinical pharmacist played a key role for patients health care during the pandemic.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: Chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) is prevalent among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD). However, the impact of CNCP on buprenorphine treatment outcomes is largely unknown. In this secondary analysis, we examined treatment outcomes among individuals with and without CNCP who received a low-barrier buprenorphine maintenance regimen during waitlist delays to more comprehensive opioid treatment. METHODS: Participants were 28 adults with OUD who received 12 weeks of buprenorphine treatment involving bimonthly clinic visits, computerized medication dispensing, and phone-based monitoring. At intake and monthly follow-up assessments, participants completed the Brief Pain Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI), Addiction Severity Index and staff-observed urinalysis. RESULTS: Participants with CNCP (n = 10) achieved comparable rates of illicit opioid abstinence as those without CNCP (n = 18) at weeks 4 (90% vs. 94%), 8 (80% vs. 83%), and 12 (70% vs. 67%)(p's = 0.99). Study retention was also similar, with 90% and 83% of participants with and without CNCP completing the 12-week study, respectively (p = 0.99). Furthermore, individuals with CNCP demonstrated significant improvements on the BDI-II and Global Severity Index subscale of the BSI (p's < 0.05). However, those with CNCP reported more severe medical problems and smaller reductions in legal problems relative to those without CNCP (p's = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Despite research suggesting that chronic pain may influence OUD treatment outcomes, participants with and without CNCP achieved similar rates of treatment retention and significant reductions in illicit opioid use and psychiatric symptomatology during low-barrier buprenorphine treatment.",nocancer
"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a challenging condition to treat. It has primarily been associated with anti-resorptive and anti-angiogenic drugs, which are increasingly being used to prevent adverse skeletally-related complications in patients with cancer and bone pathologies. Although these medications have been proven to cause osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ) there are also a number of other drugs that could potentially cause this condition. The aim of this systematic review is to ascertain whether there is an associated risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in recreational drug users (RDU). Three authors independently searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for published reports of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in recreational drug users (RDU) or illicit drug users (IDU) who had no history of treatment with anti-angiogenic or anti-resorptive agents. Only 30 studies were eligible for analysis, and all were independently assessed for risk of bias. There was a total of 101 patients with ONJ attributed solely to illicit drug consumption. The most common site of ONJ was the maxilla (n=54). The most common illicit drug related to ONJ was desmorphine, known as 'Krokodil', this was followed by cocaine, methamphetamine, anabolic steroids, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen. In 52 of the cases, the ONJ resolved following treatment, however, eight showed a recurrence. Although all the studies were judged to be at a high risk of bias, the limited data suggest that some patients are at risk of developing ONJ as a result of illicit drug usage. Studies of higher quality are needed to establish the relative risk of ONJ in this patient group.",nocancer
"Skeletal muscle atrophy, dysfunction, and weakness are consequences of noncommunicable diseases which result in exercise and functional limitations which contribute to poor quality of life and increased mortality. Home-based resistance training may promote skeletal muscle health. Electronic-based systematic searches were performed identifying randomised controlled trials utilising home-based resistance training in patients with noncommunicable diseases defined as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus (type 1 and 2), chronic kidney disease (including dialysis), and chronic respiratory disease (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension). A comparator group was defined as one containing ""non-exercise"" or ""usual care"". Of the 239 studies identified (published between 1996 and 2020), 22 met the inclusion criteria. Sixteen studies contained an adjunct aerobic training component. Study designs and outcome measures showed large variation. Reporting of the principles of training applied within interventions was poor. Heterogeneity in study characteristics, and poor reporting of training characteristics, prevents formal recommendations for optimising home-based resistance training. However, home-based interventions are less resource-intensive than supervised programmes and appear to have the ability to improve or preserve pertinent outcomes such as strength, functional ability, and quality of life; potentially reducing the risk of mortality in patients with chronic disease.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To describe the natural history of afferent baroreflex failure (ABF) based on systematic review of clinical and laboratory data in patients with a diagnosis of ABF at Mayo Clinic Rochester. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients who underwent standardized autonomic reflex testing between 2000 and 2020 and had confirmation of the diagnosis of ABF by an autonomic disorders specialist. Patients were identified using a data repository of medical records. Variables included demographic, all-cause mortality, medications, ABF manifestations, comorbidities, and laboratory (autonomic testing, blood pressure monitoring, echocardiogram, brain imaging, plasma catecholamines, serum sodium level and kidney function tests). RESULTS: A total of 104 patients with ABF were identified. Head and neck radiation was the most common etiology (86.5%), followed by neck surgery (5.8%) and other causes (7.7%). The most common findings were hypertension (87.5%), fluctuating blood pressure (78.8%), orthostatic hypotension (91.3%), syncope (58.6%), headache (22.1%) and tachycardia (20.2%). Patients commonly received antihypertensives (66.3%), pressor agents (41.3%) or a combination of both (19.2%). The median latency from completion of radiation to ABF was longer compared to the latency in the surgery group (p<0.0001). Comorbidities, including complication from neck radiation, were frequently seen and all-cause mortality was 39.4% over a 20-year period. CONCLUSIONS: ABF should be suspected in patients with prior head and neck cancer treated by radiation and/or surgery who present with labile hypertension and orthostatic hypotension. The management may require both antihypertensive and pressor medications. The morbidity and mortality in ABF patients are high.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: According to the Japanese guidelines for the management of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the first choice is metronidazole (MNZ) for non-severe cases and vancomycin (VCM) for severe cases. However, the appropriateness of this first choice in Japanese patients is unclear. We therefore evaluated the appropriateness of the CDI management guidelines and the incidence of adverse drug reactions. METHODS: The electronic chart data at Keio University Hospital between January 2012 and June 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. The response rate, the relapse rate, and the adverse reaction rate of treatment for CDI using MNZ or VCM were investigated according to the disease severity. Factorial analysis associated with the response, relapse, and adverse reaction was also performed. RESULTS: In the 352 patients surveyed, no significant difference was observed in the response rate between MNZ and VCM regardless of the severity of CDI. The presence of cancer was a factor related to the persistence of diarrheal symptoms and older age was a risk factor for relapse. MNZ induced nausea significantly more frequently than VCM, and young age and female sex were risk factors for nausea. CONCLUSION: As no significant difference was observed in the response rate of CDI between MNZ and VCM, the Japanese CDI management guidelines, which recommend MNZ as the first choice, were demonstrated to be appropriate. Attention to nausea was also suggested to be necessary when administering MNZ to young females.",nocancer
"Nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4)-mediated ferritinophagy has been implicated in the ferroptosis in cancer cells and hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. However, the role of iron metabolism, especially NCOA4-mediated degradation of ferritin, has not been explored in the proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells. The present study was designed to explore the role of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy in hypoxia-treated dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). Hypoxia treatment increased ROS generation, boosted cytosolic labile iron pool, increased expression of transferrin receptor 1 and NCOA4. Moreover, colocalization of LC3B with NCOA4 and ferritin was observed in hypoxia-treated DPSCs, indicating the development of ferritinophagy. Hypoxia promoted the proliferation of DPSCs, but not ferroptosis, under normal serum supplement and serum deprivation. NCOA4 knock-down reduced ferritin degradation and inhibited proliferation of DPSCs under hypoxia. Furthermore, the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway was involved in the upregulation of NCOA4 in hypoxia. Therefore, our present study suggested that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy promoted the level of labile iron pool, leading to enhanced iron availability and elevated cell proliferation of DPSCs. Our present study uncovered a physiological role of ferritinophagy in the proliferation and growth of mesenchymal stem cells under hypoxia.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: To explore the diagnostic value of changes in serum C-X-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 16 (CXCL16), cystatin C (CysC), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and urinary microalbumin (mALB) in patients with gout complicated by early renal damage. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 47 patients with gout without complications and 48 patients with gout complicated by early renal damage was conducted in our hospital. A retrospective analysis was performed with 50 healthy people as controls. Serum IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), CXCL16, CysC, COX-2, and urine mALB levels were detected and analyzed, and the diagnostic efficacy of single factor and multifactor combined detection for early renal damage in patients with gout was analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Serum interleukin-8 (IL-8), TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, CXCL16, CysC, COX-2, and urine mALB/Cr levels of patients with gout were significantly higher than those of healthy people (p < 0.01). Serum IL-8, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, CXCL16, CysC, COX-2 and urinary mALB/Cr levels in patients with gout complicated by early renal damage were significantly higher than those in patients with gout but without complications (p < 0.01). The sensitivity of CXCL16, CysC, COX-2, and mALB in diagnosing gout patients with early renal damage can reach 91.7%. CXCL16 and COX-2 were positively correlated with CysC and mALB/Cr, respectively, p < 0.01. The area under the ROC curve of CXCL16, CysC, COX-2, and mALB in the diagnosis of gout patients with early renal damage was 0.763, 0.832, 0.518, and 0.895, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: CysC and mALB are sensitive indicators for the diagnosis of early renal damage. The combined diagnosis of CXCL16 and COX-2 can effectively improve the detection sensitivity of early renal damage in patients with gout.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is a hallmark of cardiovascular disease but is characterized by crude measurements of triglycerides, HDL- and LDL cholesterol. Lipidomics enables more detailed measurements of plasma lipids, which may help improve risk stratification and understand the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. METHODS: Lipidomics was used to measure 184 lipids in plasma samples from the Malmo Diet and Cancer - Cardiovascular Cohort (N = 3865), taken at baseline examination. During an average follow-up time of 20.3 years, 536 participants developed coronary artery disease (CAD). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were applied to Cox proportional hazards models in order to identify plasma lipids that predict CAD. RESULTS: Eight plasma lipids improved prediction of future CAD on top of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Principal component analysis of CAD-associated lipids revealed one principal component (PC2) that was associated with risk of future CAD (HR per SD increment =1.46, C I = 1.35-1.48, P < 0.001). The risk increase for being in the highest quartile of PC2 (HR = 2.33, P < 0.001) was higher than being in the top quartile of systolic blood pressure. Addition of PC2 to traditional risk factors achieved an improvement (2%) in the area under the ROC-curve for CAD events occurring within 10 (P = 0.03), 15 (P = 0.003) and 20 (P = 0.001) years of follow-up respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A lipid pattern improve CAD prediction above traditional risk factors, highlighting that conventional lipid-measures insufficiently describe dyslipidemia that is present years before CAD. Identifying this hidden dyslipidemia may help motivate lifestyle and pharmacological interventions early enough to reach a substantial reduction in absolute risk.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to perform a quantitative assessment of the prostate anatomy with a focus on the relation of prostatic urethral anatomic variation to urinary symptoms. METHODS: This retrospective study involved patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging for prostate cancer who were also assessed for lower urinary tract symptoms. Volumetric segmentations were utilized to derive the in vivo prostatic urethral length and urethral trajectory in coronal and sagittal planes using a piece-wise cubic spline function to derive the angle of the urethra within the prostate. Association of anatomical factors with urinary symptoms was evaluated using ordinal univariable and multivariable logistic regression with IPSS score cutoffs of <=7, 8-19, and >20 to define mild, moderate, and severe symptoms, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 423 patients were included. On univariable analysis, whole prostate volume, transition zone volume, prostatic urethral length, urethral angle, and retrourethral volume were all significantly associated with worse urinary symptoms. On multivariable analysis prostatic urethral length was associated with urinary symptoms with a normalized odds ratio of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.0-2.2, p = 0.04). In a subset analysis of patients on alpha blockers, maximal urethral angle, transition zone volume as well as urethral length were all associated with worse urinary symptoms. CONCLUSION: Multiple parameters were associated with worse urinary symptoms on univariable analysis, but only prostatic urethral length was associated with worse urinary symptoms on multivariable analysis. This study demonstrates the ability of quantitative assessment of prostatic urethral anatomy to predict lower urinary tract symptoms.",nocancer
"Hepatic fibrosis would develop into cirrhosis or cancer without treating. Hence, it is necessary to study the mechanism and prevention methods for hepatic fibrosis. Gynostemma pentaphyllum is a traditional medicinal material with a high medicinal and health value. In this study, nineteen compounds obtained from G. pentaphyllum were qualitative and quantitative by HPLC-FT-ICR MS and HPLC-UV, respectively. Among them, the total content of 19 gypenosides accurately quantified reaches 72.21 mg/g and their anti-proliferation against t-HSC/Cl-6 cells indicated compound 19 performed better activity (IC50: 28.1 +- 2.0 muM) than the other compounds. Further network pharmacology study demonstrated that compound 19 mainly plays an anti-fibrosis role by regulating the EGFR signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Overall, the verification result indicated that compound 19 appeared to be nontoxic to LO2, was able to modulate the PI3K/Akt signal, led to subG1 cells cycle arrest and the activation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis of t-HSC/Cl-6 cells for anti-hepatic fibrosis.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Clinical characteristics and outcomes of venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients with concomitant anemia are unclear. This study compares baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, and 24-month outcomes in patients with and without anemia within GARFIELD-VTE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: GARFIELD-VTE (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02155491) is a global, prospective, non-interventional registry of real-world treatment practices. Of the 10,679 patients enrolled in GARFIELD-VTE, 7698 were eligible for analysis. Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, recurrent VTE, and major bleeding in VTE patients with or without concomitant anemia over 24-months after diagnosis. Event rates and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Poisson regression. Adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: Distribution of VTE events in 2771 patients with anemia and 4927 without anemia was similar (deep-vein thrombosis alone: 61 1% vs. 55 9%, pulmonary embolism +- deep vein thrombosis: 38 9% vs. 44 0%, respectively). Patients with anemia were older (62.6 year vs. 58.9 years) than those without. At baseline, VTE risk factors that were more common in patients with anemia included hospitalization (22 0% vs. 6 8%), surgery (19 2% vs. 8 2%), cancer (20 1% vs. 5 6%) and acute medical illness (8 3% vs. 4 2%). Patients with anemia were more likely to receive parenteral anticoagulation therapy alone than those without anemia (26 6% vs. 11 7%) and less likely to receive a direct oral anticoagulant (38 5% vs. 53 5%). During 24-months of follow-up, patients with anemia had a higher risk (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]) of all-cause mortality (1 84 [1 56-2 18]), major bleeding (2 83 [2 14-3 75]). Among anemia patients, the risk of all-cause mortality and major bleeding remained higher in patients with severe anemia than in those with mild/moderate anemia, all-cause mortality: HR 1 43 [95% CI: 1 21-1 77]; major bleeding: HR 2 08 [95% CI: 1 52-2 86]). CONCLUSIONS: VTE patients with concomitant anemia have a higher risk of adverse clinical outcomes compared with those without anemia. Further optimization of anticoagulation therapy for VTE patients with anemia is warranted.",nocancer
"Phospholipase A2 Bothropstoxin-I (PLA2 BthTX-I) is a myotoxic Lys49-PLA2 from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom. In order to evaluate the DNA damage caused by BthTX-I, we used the Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster and Comet assay in HUVEC and DU-145 cells. For SMART, different concentrations of BthTX-I (6.72 to 430 mug/mL) were used and no significant changes in the survival rate were observed. Significant frequency of mutant spots was observed for the ST cross at the highest concentration of BthTX-I due to recombinogenic activity. In the HB cross, BthTX-I increased the number of mutant spots at intermediate concentrations, being 53.75 mug/mL highly mutagenic and 107.5 mug/mL predominantly recombinogenic. The highest concentrations were neither mutagenic nor recombinogenic, which could indicate cytotoxicity in the wing cells of D. melanogaster. In vitro, all BthTX-I concentrations (1 to 50 mug/mL) induced decrease in HUVEC cell viability, as well as in DU-145 cells at concentrations of 10, 25, and 50 mug/mL. The comet assay showed that in HUVEC and DU-145 cells, all BthTX-I concentrations promoted increase of DNA damage. Further studies should be performed to elucidate the mechanism of action of PLA2 BthTX-I and its possible use in therapeutic strategies against cancer.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Single incision laparoscopic colectomy (SILC) and single incision robotic colectomy (SIRC) are both advanced minimally invasive operative techniques. However, studies comparing these two surgical methods have not been published. The purpose of this study is to compare and evaluate the short-term outcomes of SIRC with those of SILC. METHODS: A total of 21 consecutive patients underwent SIRC and 136 consecutive patients underwent SILC in separate institutes between January 2013 and December 2019. We used retrospective cohort matching to analyze these patients. RESULTS: Prior to matching, patients who underwent SIRC had a lower percentage of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades III-IV (5% vs. 19%, P = 0.11) compared with patients who underwent SILC. The SIRC group revealed a higher proportion of sigmoid colon lesions and anterior resections than the SILC group (61% vs. 45%, P = 0.16). After 1:4 cohort matching, 21 patients were enrolled in the SIRC group and 84 patients were enrolled in the SILC group. No statistically significant difference in terms of operative time (SIRC: 185 +- 46 min, SILC: 208 +- 53 min; P = 0.51), estimated blood loss (SIRC: 12 +- 22 ml, SILC: 85 +- 234 ml; P = 0.12), and complications (SIRC: 4.7%, SIRC: 7.1%; P = 0.31) was observed between these groups. Length of postoperative hospital stay (SIRC: 8.3 +- 1.7 days, SILC: 9.3 +- 6.5; P = 0.10) and number of harvested lymph nodes (SIRC: 21.3 +- 10.3, SILC: 21.3 +- 9.5; P = 0.77) were also similar between the two groups. In subgroup analysis, numbers of harvested lymph node is less in SIRC than SILC (SIRC: 18.1 +- 4.7 vs. SILC: 18.9 +- 8.1, P = 0.04) in anterior resection.

"A simple and sensitive preconcentration strategy using sequential electrokinetic and hydrodynamic injection modes in micellar electrokinetic chromatography with diode array detector was developed and applied for the separation and determination of anticancer agent, 5-fluorouracil and its metabolite, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine in human plasma. Sequential injection modes with increased analyte loading capacity using the anionic pseudo-stationary phase facilitated collection of the dispersed neutral and charged analytes into narrow zones and improved sensitivity. Several important parameters affecting sample enrichment performance were evaluated and optimized in this study. Under the optimized experimental conditions, 614- and 643-fold and 782- and 803-fold sensitivity improvement were obtained for 5-fluorouracil and its metabolite when compared with normal hydrodynamic and electrokinetic injection, respectively. The method has good linearity (1-1000 ng/mL) with acceptable coefficient of determination (r2 > 0.993), low limits of detection (0.11-0.14 ng/mL) and satisfactory analytes relative recovery (97.4-99.7%) with relative standard deviations of 4.6-9.3% (n=6).

"INTRODUCTION: The quality indicators of the Initiative Qualitatsmedizin e. V. (IQM) have been developed as triggers to examine treatment processes for opportunities for improvement. Published quality results have partly been used for external quality comparisons in the media. Therefore, member hospitals of IQM demanded to investigate if methods of risk adjustment should be applied in the calculation of the quality indicators. After a hearing of experts had been held, a task force was founded to conduct test calculations on risk adjustment methods. METHODS: Specific risk adjustment models for mortality in myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, pneumonia, and colectomy in colorectal cancer were developed in the database of national German DRG data of the year 2016. These models were used to calculate standardized mortality ratios (SMR) per indicator in a sample of 172 member hospitals of IQM based on the data of the year 2018. Median SMR per indicator were compared to median SMR based on a standardization by age and gender, which is the standard procedure in IQM. Correlations between the different SMR were calculated. Quality of care was judged by two different approaches: a) a descriptive discrepancy of  0.1  from the SMR value of 1, and b) a significant discrepancy from 1 using the 95% confidence limits. The effect of using the specific risk adjustment in relation to the standard procedure was investigated for both approaches (a and b). RESULTS: The specific risk adjustment methods showed an area under the curve between 0.72 and 0.84. The median differences between the SMR based on standardization by age and gender and the SMR based on specific risk adjustment were small (between 0 and 0.4); Spearman's correlations were between 0.90 and 0.99. Changes in the judgement of quality of care in comparison to the national average occurred in 3.9% (mortality from pneumonia) to 20.6% of the hospitals (mortality from heart failure) in descriptive comparisons. When the judgement was based on confidence limits changes were observed in 1.6% (mortality after colectomy) to 17.4% of the hospitals (mortality from heart failure). DISCUSSION: Implementing specific risk adjustment models had only minor effects on the distribution of risk-adjusted mortality compared to the standard procedure, but the judgement of quality of care could change for a fifth of the hospitals in individual indicators. Concerning methodological and practical reasons, the task force recommends further development of risk adjustment methods for selected indicators. This should be accompanied by studies on the validity of inpatient administrative data for quality management as well as by efforts to improve the usefulness of these data for such purposes.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical effect of fire needling and filiform needling for mild to moderate knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and observe the influence on related serum inflammatory sytokines. METHODS: A total of 60 patients with mild to moderate KOA were randomly divided into an observation group (30 cases, 4 cases dropped off) and a control group (30 cases, 4 cases dropped off). Both groups were given basic health management, and the acupoints of the two groups were Liangqiu (ST 34), Xuehai (SP 10), Neixiyan (EX-LE 4), Dubi (ST 35), Yanglingquan (GB 34) and ashi point. The observation group was treated with fire needling, while the control group was treated with filiform needling. Both groups were treated once every other day, 3 times a week for 2 weeks. The Western Ontario and McMaster University osteoarthritis index (WOAMC) scores of the two groups were compared before treatment, in 1, 2 weeks of treatment and 2, 6 weeks of follow-up. ELISA method was used to detect the levels of serum interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3) before treatment and in 2 weeks of treatment. The clinical effect of the two groups was evaluated in 1, 2 weeks of treatment and 2, 6 weeks of follow-up. RESULTS: At each time point of treatment and follow-up, the pain, stiffness, difficulty of daily activities scores and WOMAC total scores of the two groups were lower than those before treatment (P<0.05); the stiffness score of the observation group was lower than that of the control group in 1 week of treatment (P<0.05); the various scores and total scores of the WOMAC scale of the observation group were lower than those of the control group in 1, 2 weeks of treatment and 2, 6 weeks of follow-up (P<0.05). In 2 weeks of treatment, the levels of serum MMP-3 and IL-1alpha in the observation group and IL-1alpha in the control group were higher than those before treatment (P<0.05). In 1 week of treatment and 2, 6 weeks of follow-up, the total effective rates of the observation group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Fire needling can improve the pain, stiffness and joint dysfunction of patients with mild to moderate KOA, and increase serum MMP-3 and IL-1alpha levels. Its short and long term clinical effects are better than filiform needling.",nocancer
"Vitamin D has been identified as an essential biomarker for various diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, many reports have demonstrated a potential link between vitamin D and systemic infections, including coronavirus disease 2019. The villi of the small intestine increase the surface area of the intestinal walls, demonstrating exceptionally efficient absorption of nutrients in the lumen and adding digestive secretions. In this study, based on the villi structure, we developed a bio-inspired silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor for the ultrasensitive and selective detection of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3. The densely packed nanovilli structure enhanced the Raman signal, forming hotspots owing to its large surface area. Using experiments and electromagnetic simulations, we optimized the nanovilli structure as a SERS sensor. The sandwich-type aptasensor was designed using an aptamer and 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione-methylene blue complex. The nanovilli-based aptasensor could sensitively detect various concentrations of 25-hydroxy vitamin D3, ranging from those found in deficient to excess conditions. The detection limit of the nanovilli-based sandwich-type aptasensor for 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 was 0.001 ng/mL, which is much lower than the deficiency concentration, and was detectable even in the human serum. In addition, our proposed sensor exhibited good repeatability (17.76%) and reproducibility (7.47%). Moreover, the nanovilli-based sandwich-type SERS aptasensor could selectively distinguish 25-hydroxy vitamin D3 from other vitamins. The silver nanovilli-based sandwich-type surface enhanced Raman scattering aptasensor opens a new avenue for the development of a bio-inspired vitamin-sensing platform.",nocancer
"Integration of a vertebral fracture identification service into a Fracture Liaison Service is possible. Almost one-fifth of computerised tomography scans performed identified an individual with a fracture. This increase in workload needs to be considered by any FLS that wants to utilise such a service. INTRODUCTION: This service improvement project aimed to improve detection of incidental vertebral fractures on routine imaging. It embedded a vertebral fracture identification service (Optasia Medical, OM) on routine computerised tomography (CT) scans performed in this hospital as part of its Fracture Liaison Service (FLS). METHODS: The service was integrated into the hospital's CT workstream. Scans of patients aged >= 50 years for 3 months were prospectively retrieved, alongside their clinical history and the CT report. Fractures were identified via OM's machine learning algorithm and cross-checked by the OM radiologist. Fractures identified were then added as an addendum to the original CT report and the hospital FLS informed. The FLS made recommendations based on an agreed algorithm. RESULTS: In total, 4461 patients with CT scans were retrieved over the 3-month period of which 850 patients had vertebra fractures identified (19.1%). Only 49% had the fractures described on hospital radiology report. On average, 61 patients were identified each week with a median of two fractures. Thirty-six percent were identified by the FLS for further action and recommendations were made to either primary care or the community osteoporosis team within 3 months of fracture detection. Of the 64% not identified for further action, almost half was because the CT was part of cancer assessment or treatment. The remaining were due to a combination of only <= 2 mild fractures; already known to a bone health specialist; in the terminal stages of any chronic illness; significant dependency for activities of daily living; or a life expectancy of less than 12 months CONCLUSION: It was feasible to integrate a commercial vertebral fracture identification service into the daily working of a FLS. There was a significant increase in workload which needs to be considered by any future FLS planning to incorporate such a service into their clinical practice.",nocancer
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19), outbreak was first reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan, China. COVID-19 managed to spread worldwide and so far more than 9.1 million cases and more than 4.7 lakh death has been reported globally. Children, pregnant women, elderly population, immunocompromised patients, and patients with conditions like asthma, diabetes, etc. are highly vulnerable to COVID infection. Currently, there is no treatment available for COVID-19 infection. Traditional medicinal plants have provided bioactive molecules in the past that are efficiently used during conditions like cancer, malaria, microbial infections, immune-compromised states, etc. AYUSH India has recommended the use of Curcuma longa, Allium sativum, Ocimum tenuiflorum, and Withania somnifera for immune-boosting during SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the present study, we investigated the potential of 63-major bioactive molecules of these plants against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) through docking studies and compared the results with known inhibitor 11a. Our results proposed cuscohygrine, gamma-Glutamyl-S-allylcysteine, anahygrine, and S-allylcystein as the potent inhibitors against Mpro identified using molecular docking and molecular simulation dynamics. Interestingly, these molecules are from A. sativum, and W. somnifera, which are known for their antimicrobial and immunomodulatory potential. None of the proposed molecules have earlier been reported as antiviral molecules. Our results predict very strong potential of these four-molecules against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, especially gamma-glutamyl-S-allylcysteine, as all four form hydrogen bonding with Glu166 that is a crucial residue for the formation of the biologically active dimeric form of Mpro. Therefore, we strongly recommend further research on these biomolecules against SARS-CoV-2.",nocancer
"In this pilot study, ethosomes and transethosomes were investigated as potential delivery systems for cholecalciferol (vitamin D3), whose deficiency has been correlated to many disorders such as dermatological diseases, systemic infections, cancer and sarcopenia. A formulative study on the influence of pharmaceutically acceptable ionic and non-ionic surfactants allowed the preparation of different transethosomes. In vitro cytotoxicity was evaluated in different cell types representative of epithelial, connective and muscle tissue. Then, the selected nanocarriers were further investigated at light and transmission electron microscopy to evaluate their uptake and intracellular fate. Both ethosomes and transethosomes proven to have physicochemical properties optimal for transdermal penetration and efficient vitamin D3 loading; moreover, nanocarriers were easily internalized by all cell types, although they followed distinct intracellular fates: ethosomes persisted for long times inside the cytoplasm, without inducing subcellular alteration, while transethosomes underwent rapid degradation giving rise to an intracellular accumulation of lipids. These basic results provide a solid scientific background to in vivo investigations aimed at exploring the efficacy of vitamin D3 transdermal administration in different experimental and pathological conditions.",nocancer
"Lactic acid bacteria (LAB), widely used as starter cultures for the fermentation of a large variety of food, can improve the safety, shelf life, nutritional value and overall quality of the fermented products. In this regard, the selection of strains delivering health-promoting compounds is now the main objective of many researchers. Although most LAB are auxotrophic for several vitamins, it is known that certain strains have the capability to synthesize B-group vitamins. This is an important property since humans cannot synthesize most vitamins, and these could be obtained by consuming LAB fermented foods. This review discusses the use of LAB as alternative to fortification by the chemical synthesis to increase riboflavin and folates concentrations in food. Moreover, it provides an overview of the recent applications of vitamin-producing LAB with anti-inflammatory/antioxidant activities against gastrointestinal tract inflammation. This review shows the potential uses of riboflavin and folates producing LAB for the biofortification of food, as therapeutics against intestinal pathologies and to complement anti-inflammatory/anti-neoplastic treatments.",nocancer
"Folates (also known as vitamin B9) have a critical role in cellular metabolism as the starting point in the synthesis of nucleic acids, amino acids and the universal methylating agent S-adenylsmethionine1,2. Folate deficiency is associated with a number of developmental, immune and neurological disorders3-5. Mammals cannot synthesize folates de novo; several systems have therefore evolved to take up folates from the diet and distribute them within the body3,6. The proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT) (also known as SLC46A1) mediates folate uptake across the intestinal brush border membrane and the choroid plexus4,7, and is an important route for the delivery of antifolate drugs in cancer chemotherapy8-10. How PCFT recognizes folates or antifolate agents is currently unclear. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of PCFT in a substrate-free state and in complex with a new-generation antifolate drug (pemetrexed). Our results provide a structural basis for understanding antifolate recognition and provide insights into the pH-regulated mechanism of folate transport mediated by PCFT.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Longer life expectancy exposes the older person to vulnerability, morbidity and disability and increases the risk of developing dementia. The number of elderly patients with dementia reaching the advanced stage is increasing in entire settings. This condition of poor quality of life existing over months and years, when the time of death cannot be predicted, raises dilemmas in medical and ethical decisions. Dementia is an incurable disease at the last stage of life, highlighting a therapeutic approach in the provision of palliative care with emphasis on the quality of life as a primary goal. In older age, any advanced chronic disease is incurable and palliative care includes life-long therapies with hospice-type supportive care. Advanced dementia stresses an aggravated approach, and the recommendation is to provide only hospice type palliative care. The purpose of this survey is to review the existing evidence in base evidence literature containing prognostic parameters indicating mortality at six months including cognitive, functional, nutrition and morbidity factors, and focusing on pressure ulcers. Thus, the goal is to allow the attending team and the families to make appropriate evidence based medical-ethical decisions. A systematic review of the medical literature found seven articles with indices predicting mortality within six months in patients with advanced dementia (5 studies originated in the USA, 2 from Israel). The most common predictor variable in 100% of studies is eating and swallowing problems associated with the consequences of malnutrition and indigestion, weight loss and loss of appetite. The variable in 80% of the studies is background diseases including: cancer, heart failure, second-degree pressure ulcers, and lack of control of the sphincters. In 75% of cases, functional decline in personal care, level of consciousness and alertness are identified as variables, and in 60% of cases, mobility impairment unstable medical conditions and demographic conditions are diagnosed.",nocancer
"The discovery of novel bioactive lipids that promote human health is of great importance. Combining ""suspect"" and targeted lipidomic liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) approaches, a previously unrecognized class of oxidized fatty acids, the saturated oxo fatty acids (SOFAs), which carry the oxo functionality at various positions of the long chain, was identified in human plasma. A library of SOFAs was constructed, applying a simple green photochemical hydroacylation reaction as the key synthetic step. The synthesized SOFAs were studied for their ability to inhibit in vitro the cell growth of three human cancer cell lines. Four oxostearic acids (OSAs) were identified to inhibit the cell growth of human lung carcinoma A549 cells. 6OSA and 7OSA exhibited the highest cell growth inhibitory potency, suppressing the expression of both STAT3 and c-myc, which are critical regulators of cell growth and proliferation. Thus, naturally occurring SOFAs may play a role in the protection of human health.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Survival of liver transplant recipients beyond 1 year since transplantation is compromised by an increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular events, infection, and graft failure. Few clinical tools are available to identify patients at risk of these complications, which would flag them for screening tests and potentially life-saving interventions. In this retrospective analysis, we aimed to assess the ability of deep learning algorithms of longitudinal data from two prospective cohorts to predict complications resulting in death after liver transplantation over multiple timeframes, compared with logistic regression models. METHODS: In this machine learning analysis, model development was done on a set of 42 146 liver transplant recipients (mean age 48 6 years [SD 17 3]; 17 196 [40 8%] women) from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) in the USA. Transferability of the model was further evaluated by fine-tuning on a dataset from the University Health Network (UHN) in Canada (n=3269; mean age 52 5 years [11 1]; 1079 [33 0%] women). The primary outcome was cause of death, as recorded in the databases, due to cardiovascular causes, infection, graft failure, or cancer, within 1 year and 5 years of each follow-up examination after transplantation. We compared the performance of four deep learning models against logistic regression, assessing performance using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). FINDINGS: In both datasets, deep learning models outperformed logistic regression, with the Transformer model achieving the highest AUROCs in both datasets (p<0 0001). The AUROC for the Transformer model across all outcomes in the SRTR dataset was 0 804 (99% CI 0 795-0 854) for 1-year predictions and 0 733 (0 729-0 769) for 5-year predictions. In the UHN dataset, the AUROC for the top-performing deep learning model was 0 807 (0 795-0 842) for 1-year predictions and 0 722 (0 705-0 764) for 5-year predictions. AUROCs ranged from 0 695 (0 680-0 713) for prediction of death from infection within 5 years to 0 859 (0 847-0 871) for prediction of death by graft failure within 1 year. INTERPRETATION: Deep learning algorithms can incorporate longitudinal information to continuously predict long-term outcomes after liver transplantation, outperforming logistic regression models. Physicians could use these algorithms at routine follow-up visits to identify liver transplant recipients at risk for adverse outcomes and prevent these complications by modifying management based on ranked features.

"OBJECTIVE: To study the baseline cytokine levels and their relation with the severity of illness and mortality in critically ill children with severe sepsis. DESIGN: Subgroup analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Pediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary level teaching hospital in India. PATIENTS: Fifty children with severe sepsis aged 3 months to 12 years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood was collected at admission for estimation of pro-inflammatory (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-12p70, IL-17, and tumor necrotic factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta1 [TGF-beta1]) cytokines. PRIMARY OUTCOME: To find out correlation between cytokine levels and severity of illness scores (Pediatric Risk of Mortality [PRISM] III score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA], and Vasoactive-Inotropic Score [VIS]). SECONDARY OUTCOMES: To compare cytokine levels among survivors and nonsurvivors. RESULTS: Baseline pro-inflammatory cytokine levels (median [interquartile range]) were IL-6: 189 (35-285) pg/mL, IL-12p: 48 (28-98) pg/mL, IL-17: 240 (133-345) pg/mL, and TNF-alpha: 296 (198-430) pg/mL; anti-inflammatory cytokine levels were IL-10: 185 (62-395) pg/mL and TGF-beta1: 204 (92-290) ng/mL. Pro-inflammatory cytokines showed positive correlation with PRISM III score: IL-6 (Spearman correlation coefficient, rho = 0.273, P = .06), IL-12 (rho = 0.367, P = .01), IL-17 (rho = 0.197, P = .17), and TNF-alpha (rho = 0.284, P = .05), and anti-inflammatory cytokines showed negative correlation: IL-10 (rho = -0.257, P = .09) and TGF-beta (rho = -0.238, P = .11). Both SOFA and VIS also showed weak positive correlation with IL-12 (rho = 0.32, P = .03 and rho = 0.31, P = .03, respectively). Among nonsurvivors (n = 5), the levels of all the measured pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly higher as compared to survivors, IL-6: 359 (251-499) pg/mL versus 157 (97-223) pg/mL, P < .0001, IL-12p70: 167 (133-196) pg/mL versus 66 (30-100) pg/mL, P < .0001, IL-17: 400 (333-563) pg/mL versus 237 (122-318) pg/mL, P = .009, and TNF-alpha: 409 (355-503) pg/mL versus 330 (198-415) pg/mL, P = .002, respectively. CONCLUSION: In critically ill children with severe sepsis, pro-inflammatory cytokines (especially IL-12p70) showed a weak positive correlation with severity of illness and were significantly higher among nonsurvivors.",nocancer
"Certolizumab pegol (CZP), the only Fc-free, PEGylated anti-tumor necrosis factor biologic agent. This study aims to investigate the effect and safety of CZP in moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. We performed a retrospective observational analysis of the moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients under ceratolizumab pegol therapy. Primer endpoints were efficacy of CZP, defined as statistically significant improvement of PASI, PGA, and cDAPSA in the 24 week of therapy. Secondary endpoints were safety of CZP especially during COVID-19 pandemic. Fifty-six moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients treated with CZP were evaluated retrospectively. We observed a rapid and significiant reduction of PASI, PGA and c DAPSA scores in W4. After loading dose we observed loss of clinical efficacy of CZP in 8 patients and optimized therapy by increasing the dosing of CZP. Dose escalation of CZP permitted the achievement and long-term maintenance of clinical improvement in these patients. We compare the clinical efficacy of CZP between naive and patients who has been treated with other biologic agents. There were no statistical differences in efficacy between these two groups. No side effects were observed during CZP treatment. There were no cases of death from COVID-related disease in our study population or patients hospitalized for COVID-19 related disease. Our results demonstrate that CZP is an effective and safe therapeutic option for patients with moderate-to-severe chrocic plaque psoriasis. This article is protected by copyright.

"Chromatin accessibility of a promoter is fundamental in regulating transcriptional activity. The histone variant H2A.Z has been shown to contribute to this regulation, but its role has remained poorly understood. Here, we prepare high-depth maps of the position and accessibility of H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes for all human Pol II promoters in epithelial, mesenchymal and isogenic cancer cell lines. We find that, in contrast to the prevailing model, many different types of active and inactive promoter structures are observed that differ in their nucleosome organization and sensitivity to MNase digestion. Key aspects of an active chromatin structure include positioned H2A.Z MNase resistant nucleosomes upstream or downstream of the TSS, and a MNase sensitive nucleosome at the TSS. Furthermore, the loss of H2A.Z leads to a dramatic increase in the accessibility of transcription factor binding sites. Collectively, these results suggest that H2A.Z has multiple and distinct roles in regulating gene expression dependent upon its location in a promoter.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Parametric imaging using the Patlak model has been shown to provide improved lesion detectability and specificity. The Patlak model requires both tissue time-activity-curves (TACs) after equilibrium and knowledge of the input function from the start of injection. Therefore, the conventional dynamic scanning protocol typically starts from the radiotracer injection all the way to equilibrium. In this paper, we propose the use of hybrid population-based and model-based input function estimation and evaluate its use for whole-body Patlak analysis, in order to reduce the total scan time and simplify clinical Patlak parametric imaging protocols. Possible quantitative errors caused by the simplified scanning protocol was also analyzed both theoretically and with the use of clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data from twenty-four patients referred for tumor staging were included in this study. The patients underwent a whole-body dynamic PET study, 20 minutes after FDG injection (0.13 mCi/kg). The proposed whole-body scanning protocol includes 6 passes with 4-5 bed positions, depending on the size of the patient, with 2 minutes for each bed position. An input function from the literature was selected as the shape of the population-based input function. The descending aorta from the corresponding CT image was segmented and applied on the reconstructed dynamic PET images to acquire an image-based input function, which was later fitted using an exponential model. Due to the late scan time, only the later portion of the input function was available, which was used to scale the population-based input function. The hybrid input function was used to derive the whole-body Patlak images. Assuming a given error in the population-based input function, its influence on the final Patlak images were also derived theoretically and verified using the clinical data sets. Finally, the image quality of the reconstructed Patlak slope image was evaluated by an experienced radiologist in four different aspects: image artifacts, image noise, lesion sharpness, and lesion detectability. RESULTS: It was found that errors in the population-based input function only affect the absolute scale of the Patlak slope image. The induced error is proportional to the percentage area-under-curve (AUC) error in the input function. These findings were also confirmed by numerical analysis. The predicted global scale was in good agreement with results from both image-based Patlak and direct Patlak approach. The fractions of the AUC from the early-portion population-based input function were also found to be around 18% of the total AUC of the input function, further limiting the propagation of quantitation error from population-based input function to the final Patlak slope image. The reconstructed Patlak images were also found by the radiologist to provide excellent confidence in lesion detection tasks. CONCLUSIONS: We have proposed a simplified whole-body scanning protocol that utilizes both population-based input function and model-based input function. The error from the population-based function was found to only affect the global scale and the overall quantitative impact can be predicted using our proposed formulas.",nocancer
"Introduction: Glyphosate, an amino acid analog of glycine, is the most widely applied organophosphate pesticide worldwide and it is an active ingredient of all glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs), including the formulation ""Roundup. "" While glycine is an essential amino acid generally recognized safe, both epidemiological and toxicological in vivo and in vitro studies available in literature report conflicting findings on the toxicity of GBHs. In our earlier in vivo studies in Sprague-Dawley rats we observed that exposure to GBHs at doses of glyphosate of 1.75 mg/kg bw/day, induced different toxic effects relating to sexual development, endocrine system, and the alteration of the intestinal microbiome. In the present work, we aimed to comparatively test in in vitro models the cytotoxicity of glycine and GBHs. Methods: We tested the cytotoxic effects of glycine, glyphosate, and its formulation Roundup Bioflow at different doses using MTT and Trypan Blue assays in human Caco2 and murine L929 cell lines. Results: Statistically significant dose-related cytotoxic effects were observed in MTT and Trypan Blue assays in murine (L929) and human (Caco2) cells treated with glyphosate or Roundup Bioflow. No cytotoxic effects were observed for glycine. In L929, Roundup Bioflow treatment showed a mean IC50 value that was significantly lower than glyphosate in both MTT and Trypan Blue assays. In Caco2, Roundup Bioflow treatment showed a mean IC50 value that was significantly lower than glyphosate in the MTT assays, while a comparable IC50 was observed for glyphosate and Roundup Bioflow in Trypan Blue assays. IC50 for glycine could not be estimated because of the lack of cytotoxic effects of the substance. Conclusion: Glyphosate and its formulation Roundup Bioflow, but not glycine, caused dose-related cytotoxic effects in in vitro human and murine models (Caco2 and L929). Our results showed that glycine and its analog glyphosate presented different cytotoxicity profiles. Glyphosate and Roundup Bioflow demonstrate cytotoxicity similar to other organophosphate pesticides (malathion, diazinon, and chlorpyriphos).",nocancer
"Melatonin is a key intracellular neuroimmune-endocrine regulator and coordinator of multiple complex and interrelated biological processes. The main functions of melatonin include the regulation of neuroendocrine and antioxidant system activity, blood pressure, rhythms of the sleep-wake cycle, the retardation of ageing processes, as well as reseting and optimizing mitochondria and thereby the cells of the immune system. Melatonin and its agonists have therefore been mooted as a treatment option across a wide array of medical disorders. This article reviews the role of melatonin in the regulation of respiratory system functions under normal and pathological conditions. Melatonin can normalize the structural and functional organization of damaged lung tissues, by a number of mechanisms, including the regulation of signaling molecules, oxidant status, lipid raft function, optimized mitochondrial function and reseting of the immune response over the circadian rhythm. Consequently, melatonin has potential clinical utility for bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, lung vascular diseases, as well as pulmonary and viral infections. The integration of melatonin's effects with the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the regulation of mitochondrial function are proposed as a wider framework for understanding the role of melatonin across a wide array of diverse pulmonary disorders.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: : Published studies investigating enteral nutrition's effect on serum inflammatory factors and the cardiac function of malnourished elderly patients with heart failure (HF) are of poor quality, with small sample sizes, and involve a homogeneous population. Therefore, in order to provide new medical evidence for clinical treatment, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the relationship between enteral nutrition and serum levels of inflammatory factors and cardiac function in elderly patients with HF. METHODS: : The protocol was written following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement guidelines. Electronic databases including Web of Science, Embase, PubMed, Wanfang, Data, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library will be searched in April 2021 by 2 independent reviewers. The primary outcome is body mass index, triceps skin fold thickness, upper arm muscle circumference, serum total protein, albumin, and hemoglobin's change in index; secondary outcomes include left ventricular ejection fraction, B-type natriuretic peptide, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. The risk of bias assessment of the included studies was performed by 2 authors independently using the tool recommended in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (version 5.1.0). We will perform meta-analysis using Review Manager Software. RESULTS: : The review will add to the existing literature by showing compelling evidence and improved guidance in clinic settings.

"BACKGROUND: The underlying mechanism on the susceptibility of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients to air pollution has yet to be clarified. OBJECTIVES: Based on the COPD in Beijing (COPDB) study, we examined whether lung dysfunction contributed to pollutant-associated systemic inflammation in COPD patients. METHODS: Proinflammatory biomarkers including interleukin-8 (IL-8) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) were measured in serum samples collected from 53 COPD and 82 healthy participants. Concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mum (PM2.5), carbonaceous components in PM2.5, and PM size distribution were continuously monitored. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the associations of biomarker differences with particle exposure, between COPD and healthy participants, and across subgroups with different levels of lung dysfunction. RESULTS: COPD patients showed higher differences in IL-8 and TNFalpha levels associated with exposure to measured pollutants, comparing to healthy controls. In advanced analysis, particle-associated differences in IL-8 and TNFalpha levels were higher in participants with poorer lung ventilation and diffusion capacity, and higher ratio of residual volume. For example, an interquartile range increase in average PM2.5 concentration 2 weeks before visits was associated with a 15.7% difference in IL-8 level in participants with the lowest ratio of measured value to predicted value of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1%pred) (65.2%), and the association decreased monotonically with increasing FEV1%pred. Associations between differences in TNFalpha level and average ultrafine particle concentration 1 week before visits increased gradually with increasing ratio of measured value to predicted value of residual volume/total lung capacity. CONCLUSIONS: COPD patients, especially those with poorer lung function, are more susceptible to systemic inflammation associated with fine particle exposure.",nocancer
"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the pathological manifestation of metabolic syndrome in liver. Its pathological changes may evolve from the initial simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis and even liver cancer. Numerous studies have proved that platelets play a vital role in liver disease and homeostasis. Particularly, anti-platelet therapy can reduce intrahepatic platelet aggregation and improve the inflammation of fatty liver. Previous study has also confirmed that SAA is a gene closely related to high-fat diet (HFD) induced obesity, and SAA1 can promote liver insulin resistance induced by Palmitate or HFD. Here, we found that SAA1 treated platelets presented increased sensitivity of platelet aggregation, enhanced activation and increased adhesion ability, and such function was partly dependent on Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 2 signaling. In addition, blocking SAA1 expression in vivo not only inhibited platelet aggregation in the liver tissues of NAFLD mice, but also alleviated the inflammation of fatty liver. In conclusion, our findings identify that HFD-induced hepatic overexpressed SAA1 aggravates fatty liver inflammation by promoting intrahepatic platelet aggregation, these results also imply that SAA1 may serve as a potential target for ameliorating NAFLD.",nocancer
"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the most promising molecular targets for anticancer therapy. We used boron clusters as a platform for generation of new materials. For this, functional DNA constructs conjugated with boron clusters (B-ASOs) were developed. These B-ASOs, built from 1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecaborane linked with two anti-EGFR antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), form with their complementary congeners torus-like nanostructures, as previously shown by atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-TEM) imaging. In the present work, deepened studies were carried out on B-ASO's properties. In solution, B-ASOs formed four dominant complexes as confirmed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). These complexes exhibited increased stability in cell lysate comparing to the non-modified ASO. Fluorescently labeled B-ASOs localized mostly in the cytoplasm and decreased EGFR expression by activating RNase H. Moreover, the B-ASO complexes altered the cancer cell phenotype, decreased cell migration rate, and arrested the cells in the S phase of cell cycle. The 1,2-dicarba-closo-dodecaborane-containing nanostructures did not activate NLRP3 inflammasome in human macrophages. In addition, as shown by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP MS), these nanostructures effectively penetrated the human squamous carcinoma cells (A431), showing their potential applicability as anticancer agents.",nocancer

The methodological quality of the selected studies was evaluated by the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) criteria. Altogether, five articles, assessing the use of biological drugs, were included. Globally, 35 patients participated in the studies, of which 21 were treated with rituximab (RTX) in cycles of 1000 mg every 2 weeks; 9 used infliximab 5 mg/kg; 3 used infliximab 3 mg/kg; and 2 used etanercept 25 mg twice/week. In general, an improvement in clinical picture, reduction of the mean daily dose of corticosteroids, and improvement in the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score was achieved by the end of the treatment. Complete remission occurred in almost 70% of the cases. The adverse effect rate was 34%, mainly due to infections. There were two deaths, one due to sepsis and the other due to uncontrolled vasculitis, after the biological drug withdrawal, following the development of sepsis. Based on the results of the present review, we believe that the use of biological therapy such as RTX and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha can be beneficial in treating this complication.",nocancer
"Impending and complete pathologic fractures often necessitate surgical fixation. Traditional orthopedic implants are commonly used, achieving clinically acceptable outcomes, but their metallic composition can impair radiographic evaluation and affect radiation treatments. Recognition of these concerns led to the development of radiolucent implants such as the minimally invasive Photodynamic Bone Stabilization System (PBSS; IlluminOss Medical Inc), featuring a light cured polymer contained within an inflatable balloon catheter. Two participating hospitals in one health care system reviewed cases using the PBSS implant. Twenty-five patients with 29 impending or pathologic fractures in the proximal radius or humerus from metastatic carcinoma, myeloma, lymphoma, and melanoma were identified. Clinical charts and imaging were reviewed to determine the status of the implant at final follow-up as well as complications. For analysis, a chi-square test was used for nominal variables and a t test was used for continuous variables. Eleven of the 25 patients were alive with disease at the time of analysis. Eight of 29 (27.5%) implants failed. Five of 25 (20%) patients required repeat surgery due to complications, including 3 revision open reduction and internal fixations, 1 open reduction and internal fixation for a periprosthetic fracture, and 1 screw removal. Five of the 9 cases (56%) (P=.03) with lesions in the distal humeral shaft had breakage of the implant by final follow-up, compared with 3 of 20 cases (15%) (P=.03) elsewhere in the humerus; no failures were seen in the radius. One of 4 patients (25%) also had failure in the surgical neck, although this did not reach significance. Five patients were noted to have progression of disease on follow-up radiographs, with 4 failures in patients with progression. The PBSS implants potentially allow improved surveillance of fracture healing and tumor recurrence along with decreased scattering of radiation during treatment. Unfortunately, there may be a higher rate of mechanical failures, particularly for lesions involving the distal humerus. This may be due to decreased cross-sectional area of the implant in this region as compared with the metaphyseal and proximal regions. Caution should be exercised when treating distal humeral pathologic fractures with large lytic lesions where the underlying disease process is not well controlled.

"BACKGROUND: Research on health effects of shift work has especially focused on somatic diseases, such as breast cancer and cardiometabolic disease, while less attention has been given to the association between shift work and mental health. METHODS: We used information on 19 964 female nurses (>=44 years) from the Danish Nurse Cohort, who reported current work schedule (day, evening, night, or rotating) at recruitment (1993/1999). In 5102 nurses who participated in both cohort waves, we defined persistent night shift work as working night shift in 1993 and 1999. We used Cox regression models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for relevant confounders. Through linkage of cohort participants to national registers, we defined incidence of mood and neurotic disorders as first hospital contact or redeemed prescription until November 2018. RESULTS: We found association between night shift work with mood disorders (HR = 1.31; 95%CI = 1.17-1.47) and neurotic disorders (1.29; 1.17-1.42), compared to day work. Associations were enhanced in nurses with persistent night shift work (1.85; 1.43-2.39 and 1.62; 1.26-2.09 for mood and neurotic disorders, respectively) and in nurses with specialist confirmed mood (1.69; 1.24-2.29) and neurotic (1.72; 1.22-2.44) disorders. Nurses with preexisting psychiatric disorders and full-time work seemed most susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: Night shift work is associated with increased risk of major psychiatric disorders. The novel suggestive findings of vulnerable groups, including nurses with a history of psychiatric disorders and full-time workers, are based on a limited number of cases, and further research is needed to confirm the results.",nocancer
"In the absence of water quality criteria (WQC) support for the current water quality standard (WQS), systematic WQC studies have been carried out in recent years in China. WQC for the protection of human health is established to reflect long-term consumption safety of aquatic products and water. Human health WQC for 15 toxic metals and metalloids based on exposure factors of the Chinese population and 40 field bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) were developed and analyzed in this study. Moreover, age-specific (age 2-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17, and adult) and region-specific (east, central and west China) WQC were analyzed to better understanding of the impact of specific parameter values on WQC. Human health WQC with consumption of fishes and water, consumption of fishes only, and consumption of water only were derived separately. WQC with consumption of water and organism for Hg, Cd, As, Sb, Se, Zn, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, Mn, Sn, Ba, and Sr were 0.0264, 0.710, 0.827, 3.48, 22.1, 25.7, 32.2, 32.9, 35.5, 41.8, 72.1, 97.1, 206 and 2.20 x 103 mug/L, and were 13.3 and 6.67 x 103 mug/L for Cr(VI) and Cr(III) with consumption of water only. Comparison of age-specific and region-specific WQC showed that the protection for a specific population should be considered in the development of WQC and WQS, as well as cancer effect for carcinogenic metals. Health risk analysis showed that Cd, Cu, Zn, As, Hg and Mn average concentrations in 7, 5, 9, 22, 11 and 5 provinces exceeded the WQC values with consumption of water and aquatic product, showing potential long-term health risk (HQ >= 1) to the local population. Therefore, health risks posed by these metals from dietary intake related to surface water should be paying more attention.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To develop machine learning models employing administrative health data that can estimate risk of adverse outcomes within 30 days of an opioid dispensation for use by health departments or prescription monitoring programmes. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This prognostic study was conducted in Alberta, Canada between 2017 and 2018. Participants included all patients 18 years of age and older who received at least one opioid dispensation. Pregnant and cancer patients were excluded. EXPOSURE: Each opioid dispensation served as an exposure. MAIN OUTCOMES/MEASURES: Opioid-related adverse outcomes were identified from linked administrative health data. Machine learning algorithms were trained using 2017 data to predict risk of hospitalisation, emergency department visit and mortality within 30 days of an opioid dispensation. Two validation sets, using 2017 and 2018 data, were used to evaluate model performance. Model discrimination and calibration performance were assessed for all patients and those at higher risk. Machine learning discrimination was compared with current opioid guidelines. RESULTS: Participants in the 2017 training set (n=275 150) and validation set (n=117 829) had similar baseline characteristics. In the 2017 validation set, c-statistics for the XGBoost, logistic regression and neural network classifiers were 0.87, 0.87 and 0.80, respectively. In the 2018 validation set (n=393 023), the corresponding c-statistics were 0.88, 0.88 and 0.82. C-statistics from the Canadian guidelines ranged from 0.54 to 0.69 while the US guidelines ranged from 0.50 to 0.62. The top five percentile of predicted risk for the XGBoost and logistic regression classifiers captured 42% of all events and translated into post-test probabilities of 13.38% and 13.45%, respectively, up from the pretest probability of 1.6%. CONCLUSION: Machine learning classifiers, especially incorporating hospitalisation/physician claims data, have better predictive performance compared with guideline or prescription history only approaches when predicting 30-day risk of adverse outcomes. Prescription monitoring programmes and health departments with access to administrative data can use machine learning classifiers to effectively identify those at higher risk compared with current guideline-based approaches.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: Immune checkpoint blockade therapy (ICBT) increases the anti-tumoural function of the immune system, but it can also induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Our aim was to assess the irAEs due to ICBT in patients from a single centre of Northern Spain. METHODS: We set up an observational study of patients treated in monotherapy with ICBT targeted against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (PD-L1) for solid organ tumours. All patients were followed up in a single University Hospital from March 2015 to September 2018. RESULTS: We studied 102 patients (63 men/39 women); mean age 60.6+-9.7 years, with lung (n=63), melanoma (n=21), kidney (n=11), gastric (n=3), colon (n=3) or bladder (n=1) cancer. Only 7 patients had a previous diagnosis of an immune-mediated disease, specifically: psoriasis (n=2), psoriatic arthritis (n=1), systemic lupus erythematosus (n=1), spondyloarthitis (n=1), rheumatoid arthritis (n=1) and cutaneous lupus (n=1). One of the following ICBT was administered: nivolumab (n=52), pembrolizumab (n=35), atezolizumab (n=10) and ipilimumab (n=5). After a mean follow-up time of 14.4+-7.7 months since ICBT onset, 87 (85.3%) patients had experienced irAEs, mostly gastrointestinal, thyroid and musculskeletal manifestations including inflammatory arthralgia (n= 8), arthritis (n= 6) and myositis (n=2). ICBT was discontinued in 41 patients but it was reintroduced in 30 of them after resolution of the adverse event, with a good tolerance in all cases. Thirty-six (41.4%) of the 87 patients required specific treatment (prednisone, levothyroxine, and thiamazol) for the irAEs. CONCLUSIONS: irAEs are frequent in patients undergoing ICBT. Almost half of the patients that have irAEs require treatment. Musculoskeletal manifestations are not uncommon.",nocancer
"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels et Gilg, known as Sanyeqing in China, was an extensively used folk Chinese herbal medicine. This plant had been validated to be highly effective for treating high fever, pneumonia, hepatitis, gastritis, cervicitis, lymphatic tuberculosis, septicemia, and viral meningitis. AIM OF THE REVIEW: As a review in T. hemsleyanum, this article aims to provide a critical and comprehensive evaluation for future research as well as the development of new drugs. The possible uses and future research directions of this plant were also discussed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted on different scientific search engines, including Google Scholar, Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI. Additional information was obtained from classic books about Chinese herbal medicine and scientific databases. RESULTS: T. hemsleyanum was a perennial herb climbing vine, which was mainly based on field cultivation. About 150 chemical compounds have been isolated from T. hemsleyanum, including flavonoids, phenolic acids, polysaccharides, triterpenoids, steroids, and organic acids. Studies on the physiological aspects of T. hemsleyanum have been focused on the effects of light and fertilizer on their growth, and few other studies have been conducted. The plant had widespread pharmacological effects on the immune system, as well as anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic. CONCLUSIONS: T. hemsleyanum was a valuable traditional Chinese medical herb with pharmacological activities that mainly affected the immune system. This review summarized its botanical description, cultivation techniques, physiology, ethnopharmacology, chemical components, and pharmacological functions. This information suggested that we should focus on the development of new drugs related to T. hemsleyanum. Meanwhile, it was important to emphasize the traditional use of T. hemsleyanum, avoiding over-harvesting that exerted a great impact on resource scarcity. And developing its new clinical usage and comprehensive utilize would augment the therapeutic potentials of T. hemsleyanum.",nocancer
"Clioquinol has been reported to act as a potential therapy for neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. However, the underlying mechanism is unclear. We have previously reported that clioquinol induces S-phase cell cycle arrest through the elevation of calcium levels in human neurotypic SH-SY5Y cells. In this study, different types of cells were observed to detect if the effect of clioquinol on intracellular calcium levels is cell type-specific. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay showed that clioquinol exhibited varying degrees of concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in different cell lines, and that the growth inhibition caused by it was not related to cell source or carcinogenesis. In addition, the inhibition of cell growth by clioquinol was positively associated with its effect on intracellular calcium content ([Ca2+ ]i ). Furthermore, the elevation of [Ca2+ ]i induced by clioquinol led to S-phase cell cycle arrest. Similar to our previous studies, the increase in [Ca2+ ]i was attributed to changes in the expression levels of the calcium pump SERCA2. Comparison of expression levels of SERCA2 between cell lines showed that cells with high levels of SERCA2 were more sensitive to clioquinol. In addition, analysis using UALCAN and the Human Protein Atlas also showed that the expression of SERCA2 in the corresponding human tissues was similar to that of the cells tested in this study, suggesting potential in the application of clioquinol in the future. In summary, our results expand the understanding of the molecular mechanism of clioquinol and provide an important strategy for the rational use of clioquinol.",nocancer
"In the general population, obesity is known to be associated with adverse outcomes, including mortality. In contrast, high body mass index (BMI) may provide a survival advantage for hemodialysis patients, which is known as the obesity paradox. Although BMI is the most commonly used measure for the assessment of obesity, it does not distinguish between fat and lean mass. Fat mass is considered to serve as an energy reserve against a catabolic condition, while the capacity to survive starvation is also thought to be dependent on its amount. Thus, fat mass is used as a nutritional marker. For example, improvement of nutritional status by nutritional intervention or initiation of hemodialysis is associated with an increase in fat mass. Several studies have shown that higher levels of fat mass were associated with better survival in hemodialysis patients. Based on body distribution, fat mass is classified into subcutaneous and visceral fat. Visceral fat is metabolically more active and associated with metabolic abnormalities and inflammation, and it is thus considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. On the other hand, subcutaneous fat has not been consistently linked to adverse phenomena and may reflect nutritional status as a type of energy storage. Visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissues have different metabolic and inflammatory characteristics and may have opposing influences on various outcomes, including mortality. Results showing an association between increased subcutaneous fat and better survival, along with other conditions, such as cancer or cirrhosis, in hemodialysis patients have been reported. This evidence suggests that fat mass distribution (i.e., visceral fat and subcutaneous fat) plays a more important role for these beneficial effects in hemodialysis patients.",nocancer
"Purpose: Vernonia amygdalina (VA) is a traditional African herbal medicine that has been reported to possess anticancer properties. However, the anticancer properties of VA silver nanoparticles have not been studied. The aim of the study was to examine and evaluate the anticancer activities of VA leaf extracts and VA silver nanoparticles on the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. Methods: VA leaves were extracted using sequential extraction assisted with ultrasound using three different solvents: ethanol, 50% ethanol, and deionized water. The silver nanoparticles were synthesised with VA aqueous extract. Results: The ethanol extract and VA silver nanoparticles inhibit MCF-7 cell proliferation with an average half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 67microg/mL and 6.11microg/mL, respectively, after 72 hours of treatment. The ethanol extract and VA silver nanoparticles also caused G1 phase cell cycle arrest, induced apoptosis and nuclear fragmentation in MCF-7 cells. Conclusion: VA ethanol extracts and VA silver nanoparticles decreased the cell viability in MCF-7 cells in a time and dose-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis and causing DNA damage. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of VA leaf extracts and VA silver nanoparticles. This study is the first to report on the anticancer activity of VA silver nanoparticles in MCF-7 cells.",nocancer
"Small-molecule mediated modulation of protein interactions of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2) family proteins was clinically validated in 2015 when Venetoclax, a selective inhibitor of the antiapoptotic protein BCL-2, achieved breakthrough status designation by the FDA for treatment of lymphoid malignancies. Since then, substantial progress has been made in identifying inhibitors of other interactions of antiapoptosis proteins. However, targeting their pro-apoptotic counterparts, the ""executioners"" BAX, BAK, and BOK that both initiate and commit the cell to dying, has lagged behind. However, recent publications demonstrate that these proteins can be positively or negatively regulated using small molecule tool compounds. The results obtained with these molecules suggest that pharmaceutical regulation of apoptosis will have broad implications that extend beyond activating cell death in cancer. We review recent advances in identifying compounds and their utility in the exogenous control of life and death by regulating executioner proteins, with emphasis on the prototype BAX.",nocancer
"Obesity is a serious health complication in almost every corner of the world. Excessive weight gain results in the onset of several other health issues such as type II diabetes, cancer, respiratory diseases, musculoskeletal disorders (especially osteoarthritis), and cardiovascular diseases. As allopathic medications and derived pharmaceuticals are partially successful in overcoming this health complication, there is an incessant need to develop new alternative anti-obesity strategies with long term efficacy and less side effects. Plants harbor secondary metabolites such as phenolics, flavonoids, terpenoids and other specific compounds that have been shown to have effective anti-obesity properties. Nanoencapsulation of these secondary metabolites enhances the anti-obesity efficacy of these natural compounds due to their speculated property of target specificity and enhanced efficiency. These nanoencapsulated and naive secondary metabolites show anti-obesity properties mainly by inhibiting the lipid and carbohydrate metabolizing enzymes, suppression of adipogenesis and appetite, and enhancing energy metabolism. This review focuses on the plants and their secondary metabolites, along with their nanoencapsulation, that have anti-obesity effects, with their possible acting mechanisms, for better human health.",nocancer
"The human type IIA topoisomerases (Top2) are essential enzymes that regulate DNA topology and chromosome organization. The Topo IIalpha isoform is a prime target for antineoplastic compounds used in cancer therapy that form ternary cleavage complexes with the DNA. Despite extensive studies, structural information on this large dimeric assembly is limited to the catalytic domains, hindering the exploration of allosteric mechanism governing the enzyme activities and the contribution of its non-conserved C-terminal domain (CTD). Herein we present cryo-EM structures of the entire human Topo IIalpha nucleoprotein complex in different conformations solved at subnanometer resolutions (3.6-7.4 A). Our data unveils the molecular determinants that fine tune the allosteric connections between the ATPase domain and the DNA binding/cleavage domain. Strikingly, the reconstruction of the DNA-binding/cleavage domain uncovers a linker leading to the CTD, which plays a critical role in modulating the enzyme's activities and opens perspective for the analysis of post-translational modifications.",nocancer
"Viola yedoensis Makino was used to treat inflammation, viral hepatitis, acute pyogenic infection, and ulcerative carbuncles. However, the protective effect on immunological liver injury (ILI) of V. yedoensis had been rarely reported. This study aimed to explore the protective effect of n -butanol extract (BE) from V. yedoensis on ILI in vitro and in vivo . In vitro , the BE significantly inhibited the secretions of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in the HepG2.2.15 cells and the replication of HBV DNA. The research data in vivo revealed that the BE reduced the levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde (MDA) in liver tissues of the ConA-induced mice, while increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX), and the effective contents of tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF- alpha ), interferon- gamma (IFN- gamma ) and the BE could ameliorate liver histological lesions. These results motivated a further investigation into the chemical constituents of BE. Four coumarins (esculetin, prionanthoside, cichoriin, and esculin) and one flavonoid (quercetin-3- O -galactoside) were isolated from the BE by silica gel column chromatography and recrystallization, of which structures were eventually confirmed by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, and MS.",nocancer
"The kinetics of the immune changes in COVID-19 across severity groups have not been rigorously assessed. Using immunophenotyping, RNA sequencing, and serum cytokine analysis, we analyzed serial samples from 207 SARS-CoV2-infected individuals with a range of disease severities over 12 weeks from symptom onset. An early robust bystander CD8+ T cell immune response, without systemic inflammation, characterized asymptomatic or mild disease. Hospitalized individuals had delayed bystander responses and systemic inflammation that was already evident near symptom onset, indicating that immunopathology may be inevitable in some individuals. Viral load did not correlate with this early pathological response but did correlate with subsequent disease severity. Immune recovery is complex, with profound persistent cellular abnormalities in severe disease correlating with altered inflammatory responses, with signatures associated with increased oxidative phosphorylation replacing those driven by cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin (IL)-6. These late immunometabolic and immune defects may have clinical implications.",nocancer
"Background: There is still relatively limited data on psoriasis and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. Objective: This study investigated the clinical characteristics and treatment of psoriasis patients with HCV infections in real-world practice. Methods: Medical records of all psoriasis patients with HCV infections who attended the outpatient clinic at Siriraj Hospital over a 10-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Of 34 patients, 26 and 8 patients were men and women, respectively with a mean age of 57.0 +- 8.7 (range, 42.2-77.2) years. The median age of psoriasis onset was 42.7 +- 12.7 (range, 8-67.25) years. With a median follow-up period of 13.6 years, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma were found in 67.6% and 29.4% of the patients, respectively. The interferon used for HCV treatment exacerbated the psoriasis in 20% of those patients. Conventional treatments and anti-tumor necrosis factors (anti-TNFs) were used in strict collaboration with hepatologists. No patients experienced a worsening of their HCV infection. Conclusion: Despite a limited number of patients, a male predominance and late-onset psoriasis were frequently observed. Although, interferon therapy for HCV can exacerbate psoriasis, it is not contraindicated. All conventional treatments and anti-TNFs can be used, provided that there is strict collaboration with hepatologists.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) may improve completeness of resection in transsphenoidal surgery for Cushing's Disease (CD) by enabling visualization of residual tumor tissue at the margins. In this review we discuss somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) as targets for FGS and overview existing SSTR-specific imaging agents. We also compare SSTR expression in normal pituitary and corticotrophinoma tissues from human and canine CD patients to assess canines as a translational model for CD. METHODS: A PubMed literature search was conducted for publications containing the terms canine, somatostatin receptor, Cushing's Disease, and corticotroph adenoma. SSTR expression data from each study was documented as the presence or absence of expression, or when possible, the number of tumors expressing a given SSTR subtype within a group of tumors being studied. Studies that used RT-PCR to quantify SSTR expression were selected for additional comparative analysis. RESULTS: SSTR5 is strongly expressed in human corticotroph adenomas and weakly expressed in surrounding pituitary parenchyma, a pattern not conclusively observed in canine patients. SSTR2 mRNA expression is similar in human normal pituitary and corticotrophinoma cells, but may be significantly higher in canine normal pituitary tissue than in corticotroph tumoral tissue. Limited data was available on SSTR subtypes 1, 3, and 4. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies must fill the knowledge gaps related to species-specific SSTR expression, thus using canine CD as a translational model may be premature. We do conclude that the expression profile of SSTR5 (i.e. high local expression in pituitary adenomas relative to normal surrounding tissues) makes SSTR5 a promising molecular target for FGS.",nocancer
"Objective: To explore the clinical features of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) with extraocular muscle involvement. Methods: The data of 2170 TAO patients who were seen at the Orbital Disease Clinic, West China Hospital, Sichuan University from September, 2009 to January, 2020 were collected retrospectively. The extraocular muscle involvement of these patients was confirmed by CT or MRI. Their general condition, medical history, clinical manifestations and imaging features were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Among the 2170 TAO patients, 932 were male and 1238 were female. The mean (+- SD) age of all the patients was (46.95+-13.06) years, ranging between 6 and 85. 1684 patients (77.60%) suffered from hyperthyroidism, 13 patients (0.59%) had thyroid cancer, 80 patients (3.69%) had hypothyroidism, and 393 patients (18.11%) had normal thyroid function. Proptosis (55.25%) and diplopia (33.09%) were the main reasons for their visits to the clinic, and restricted eye movements (83.46%) was the most common sign. 122 patients with a mean age of (53.24+-13.07) years did not show any eyelid sign and had only extraocular muscle involvement. The 2170 TAO patients had a total of 3799 eyes of extrocular muscle involvement, with 541 patients experiencing monocular involvement and 1629 patients, binocular involvement; 1204 eyes (31.69%) had a single extrocular muscle involved and 2595 eyes (68.31%) had multiple extrocular muscles involved. Inferior rectus was the most commonly involved muscle, followed by superior rectus, medial rectus, and lateral rectus in descending order of involvement frequency. Of the 1014 patients who underwent enhanced MRI, 71.99% were shown to be in the active phase. 69.03% of the 775 patients identified as being in inactive phase according to their clinical activity score (CAS) were shown to be in the active phase according to their MRI results. Conclusion: TAO patients with extraocular muscle involvement have their own specific clinical manifestations. CT and MRI can both be used to assist in the diagnosis of extraocular muscle involvement. MRI can be used to assess the pathological stage of extraocular muscles and is more sensitive than CAS.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Current cardiac intensive care unit (CICU) practice has seen a rise in patient complexity, including an increase in non-cardiac organ failure, critical care therapies, and comorbidities. We sought to describe the changing epidemiology of non-cardiac multimorbidity in the CICU population. METHODS: We analyzed consecutive unique patient admissions to two geographically distant tertiary care CICU's (n=16,390). We assessed for the prevalence of 0, 1, 2, and >=3 non-cardiac comorbidities (diabetes, chronic lung, liver, and kidney disease, cancer, and stroke/transient ischemic attack) and their associations with hospital and post-discharge one-year mortality using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The prevalence of 0, 1, 2, and >=3 non-cardiac comorbidities was 37.7%, 31.4%, 19.9%, and 11.0%, respectively. Increasing non-cardiac comorbidities were associated with a stepwise increase in mortality, length of stay, non-cardiac indications for ICU admission, and increased utilization of critical care therapies. After multivariable adjustment, compared to those without non-cardiac comorbidities, there was an increased hospital mortality for patients with 1 (odds ratio [OR] 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.10-1.54, p=0.002), 2 (OR 1.47; 95% CI: 1.22-1.77, p<0.001), and >=3 (OR 1.79; 95% CI: 1.44-2.22, p<0.001) non-cardiac comorbidities. Similar trends for each additional non-cardiac comorbidity were seen for post-discharge one-year mortality (p<0.001, all). CONCLUSIONS: In two large contemporary CICU populations, we found that non-cardiac multimorbidity was highly prevalent and a strong predictor of short and long-term adverse clinical outcomes. Further study is needed to define the best care pathways for CICU patients with acute cardiac illness complicated by non-cardiac multimorbidity.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: Depression is commonly associated with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), but its risk factors in these patients are largely unrecognized. Pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of PsA have been associated with depression in patients without autoimmune diseases. The aim of this study was to establish whether PsA patients with and without depressive symptoms differed for general or clinical variables and serum cytokines milieu. METHODS: One hundred and fifty consecutive patients with PsA were screened for depressive symptoms with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D). Patients with and without depressive symptoms were compared according to the prevalence of general risk factors for depression, comorbidities, PsA features and serum IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IL-17A. RESULTS: Fifty-eight patient (38.7%) had a depressive mood. Depressive symptoms were associated with female sex (p = 0.03) and current smoking (p = 0.05). Patients with and without depressive symptoms did not differ for general risk factors for depression and comorbidities. Depressed patients had more frequently psoriatic nail disease (p = 0.02) and significant physical disability (HAQ-DI >= 0.5) (p < 0.01) and were more frequently in moderate or high disease activity according to DAPSA score (p = 0.01). Depressed patients had higher serum IL-6 (p < 0.01) and comparable serum IL-17A and TNF-alpha. A cutoff of 2.27 pg/ml of serum IL-6 had the best ability to predict an HADS-D >= 8 (AUC 0.666 +- 0.044; p < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that serum IL-6 >= 2.27 pg/ml was independently associated with depressive symptoms (OR 3.5; CI 1.6-7.8; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum Il-6 is associated with depressive symptoms. This association suggests a direct role of systemic inflammation in the modulation of mood in PsA patients. Key Points   High PsA disease activity and physical disability are associated with depression.   Higher serum levels of IL-6 are independently associated with depression in PsA.   IL-6 might play a direct role in the development of depression in PsA patients.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: Certain pesticides have been associated with adverse health outcomes including cancer and reproductive harms. However, little is known about the prevalence of occupational pesticide exposure among agricultural workers in Canada. The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence and likelihood of occupational exposure to pesticides in Canada's agricultural industry, using three commonly used, potentially carcinogenic pesticides [chlorothalonil, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), and glyphosate] as an example. METHODS: Estimates were calculated using the Canadian Census of Population and the Census of Agriculture. The number of workers and the proportion of farms applying 'herbicides' or 'fungicides' by farm type was estimated using survey data from the Census of Agriculture. These values were multiplied to yield the potential number of workers at risk of exposure. Likelihood of exposure (i.e. exposed, probably exposed, and possibly exposed) was then qualitatively assigned using information on crop type, primary expected tasks, crop production practices, and residue transfer data. Additional agricultural workers who are at risk of exposure but not captured by the Census of Agriculture were identified using the 2016 Census of Population. RESULTS: An estimated range of 37 700-55 800 workers (11-13% of agricultural workers) were exposed to glyphosate in Canada while 30 800-43 600 workers (9-11%) and 9000-14 100 (2.9-3.2%) were exposed to 2,4-D and chlorothalonil, respectively. Approximately 70-75% of workers at risk of exposure were considered probably or possibly exposed to any of the pesticides. Glyphosate exposure was most common among workers in oilseed (29% of oilseed farm workers exposed) and dry pea/bean farms (28%), along with those providing support activities for farms (31%). 2,4-D exposure was most common in corn (28%), other grain (28%), and soybean farms (27%), while chlorothalonil exposure was more likely among greenhouse, nursery, and floriculture workers (42%), workers on farms (28%, for occupations not captured by the Census of Agriculture, specifically), and those providing support activities for farms (20%). Regional variations broadly reflected differences in farm types by province. CONCLUSIONS: This study estimated the prevalence of occupational exposure to three pesticides in Canada. Seasonal and temporary agricultural workers, which were captured by the Census of Agriculture, contributed to many additionally exposed workers. A large percent of the workers who were considered at risk of exposure were considered probably or possibly exposed, indicating a need for enhanced data collection and availability on pesticide use data in Canada. The study's methods can be applied to estimate workers' exposures to other pesticides within the agricultural industry.",nocancer
"The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a membrane anchored protease that primarily expressed by epithelial cells of respiratory and gastrointestinal systems and has been linked to multiple pathological processes in humans including tumor growth, metastasis and viral infections. Recent studies have shown that TMPRSS2 expressed on cell surface of host cells could play a crucial role in activation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein which facilitates the rapid early entry of the virus into host cells. In addition, direct suppression of TMPRSS2 using small drug inhibitors has been demonstrated to be effective in decreasing SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, which presents TMPRSS2 protease as a potential therapeutic strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be capable of infecting gastrointestinal enterocytes and to provoke gastrointestinal disorders in patients with COVID-19 disease, which is considered as a new transmission route and target organ of SARS-CoV-2. In this review, we highlight the biochemical properties of TMPRSS2 protease and discuss the potential targeting of TMPRSS2 by inhibitors to prevent the SARS-CoV-2 spreading through gastro-intestinal tract system as well as the hurdles that need to be overcome.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Regular physical activity (PA) contributes to the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic diseases and reduces the risk of premature death. Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and a variety of chronic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, bone and joint diseases (eg, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis), depression, and colon and breast cancer. Population aging and the related increase in chronic diseases have a major impact on the health care systems of most Western countries and will produce an even more significant effect in the future. Monitoring PA is a valuable method of determining whether people are performing enough PA so as to prevent chronic diseases or are showing early symptoms of those diseases. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the accuracy of wearable devices in quantifying the PA of elderly people in a real-life setting. METHODS: Participants aged 70 to 90 years with the ability to walk safely without any walking aid for at least 300 meters, who had no walking disabilities or episodes of falling while walking in the last 12 months, were asked to walk 150 meters at their preferred pace wearing a vivoactive HR device (Garmin Ltd) and actual steps were monitored and tallied by a researcher using a hand-tally counter to assess the performance of the device at a natural speed. A Bland-Altman plot was used to analyze the difference between manually counted steps and wearable device-measured steps. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was computed (with a 95% confidence interval) between step measurements. The generalized linear mixed-model (GLMM) ICCs were estimated, providing a random effect term (random intercept) for the individual measurements (gold standard and device). Both adjusted and conditional ICCs were computed for the GLMM models considering separately the effect of age, sex, BMI, and obesity. Analyses were performed using R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing) with the rms package. RESULTS: A total of 23 females and 26 males were enrolled in the study. The median age of the participants was 75 years. The Bland-Altman plot revealed that, excluding one observation, all differences across measurements were in the confidence bounds, demonstrating the substantial agreement between the step count measurements. The results were confirmed by an ICC equal to .98 (.96-.99), demonstrating excellent agreement between the two sets of measurements. CONCLUSIONS: The level of accuracy of wearable devices in quantifying the PA of elderly people in a real-life setting that was found in this study supports the idea of considering wrist-wearable nonmedical devices (widely available in nonspecialized stores) as reliable tools. Both health care professionals and informal caregivers could monitor the level of PA of their patients.",nocancer
"AIM: We aimed to evaluate the genetic variation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) 308 G>A (rs1800629) and transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1G>C (rs1800471) to confer risk in patients with recurrent miscarriage in highly consanguineous population of Kashmir (North India). METHODS: A total of 200 women who experienced two or more recurrent miscarriages (along with 100 spouses, 60 products of conception, and 240 healthy controls) with two or more full-term pregnancies were recruited from the same geographical region and evaluated by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: TNF-alpha 308 G>A variant genotype (AA) was significantly associated with recurrent miscarriage cases (2.5% vs. 0.4% controls, respectively; p < 0.05) and its per copy allele A also presented more in cases (32% vs. 24% in controls; p < 0.05) that showed a risk of 1.5-fold for cases (p < 0.05). The difference of variant genotype GA was observed to be significant among recurrent miscarriage cases and product of conception: 60.5% vs. 83%, respectively (p < 0.05) wherein variant TNF-alpha GA genotype conferred 3-fold risk (p < 0.05). On the other hand, TGF beta1 G>C showed no association with recurrent miscarriage cases in our population. CONCLUSION: The study found both TNF-alpha 308 G>A variants are significantly associated with an increased susceptibility for recurrent miscarriages to cause pregnancy losses but on the other hand TGF beta1 does not seem to impact the outcome of pregnancy in our population.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Among the many possible postoperative complications, anastomotic leakage (AL) is the most common and serious. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the ability of various inflammatory and nutritional markers to predict postoperative AL in patients after esophagectomy. METHODS: A total of 273 patients were retrospectively evaluated and enrolled into this study. Perioperative, surgery-related, tumor-related and laboratory tests data were extracted and analyzed. The discriminatory ability and optimal cut-off value was evaluated according to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to access the potential risk factors for AL. RESULTS: The overall incidence of AL was 12.5% (34/273). C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CRP/ALB ratio) [AUC 0.943 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.911-0.976, p <  0.001)] and operation time [AUC 0.747 (95% CI = 0.679-0.815, p <  0.001)] had the greatest discrimination on AL prediction. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CRP/ALB ratio and operation time were two independent risk factors for AL, and CRP/ALB ratio (OR = 102.909, p <  0.001) had an advantage over operation time (OR = 9.363, p = 0.020; Table 3). CONCLUSION: Operation time and postoperative CRP/ALB ratio were two independent predictive indexes for AL. Postoperative CRP/ALB ratio greater than 3.00 indicated a high risk of AL. For patients with abnormal postoperative CRP/ALB ratio, early non-operative treatment or surgical intervention are needed to reduce the serious sequelae of AL.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Despite the indispensable role of X-ray computed tomography (CT) in diagnostic medicine, the associated harmful ionizing radiation dose is a major concern, as it may cause genetic diseases and cancer. Decreasing patients' exposure can reduce the radiation dose and hence the related risks, but it would inevitably induce higher quantum noise. Supervised deep learning techniques have been used to train deep neural networks for denoising low-dose CT (LDCT) images, but the success of such strategies requires massive sets of pixel-level paired LDCT and normal-dose CT (NDCT) images, which are rarely available in real clinical practice. Our purpose is to mitigate the data scarcity problem for deep learning-based LDCT denoising. METHODS: To solve this problem, we devised a shift-invariant property-based neural network that uses only the LDCT images to characterize both the inherent pixel correlations and the noise distribution, shaping into our probabilistic self-learning (PSL) framework. The AAPM Low-dose CT Challenge dataset was used to train the network. Both simulated datasets and real dataset were employed to test the denoising performance as well as the model generalizability. The performance was compared to a conventional method (total variation (TV)-based), a popular self-learning method (noise2void (N2V)), and a well-known unsupervised learning method (CycleGAN) by using both qualitative visual inspection and quantitative metrics including peak signal-noise-ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) and contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR). The standard deviations (STD) of selected flat regions were also calculated for comparison. RESULTS: The PSL method can improve the averaged PSNR/SSIM values from 27.61/0.5939 (LDCT) to 30.50/0.6797. By contrast, the averaged PSNR/SSIM values were 31.49/0.7284 (TV), 29.43/0.6699 (N2V), and 29.79/0.6992 (CycleGAN). The averaged STDs of selected flat regions were calculated to be 132.3 HU (LDCT), 25.77 HU (TV), 19.95 HU (N2V), 75.06 HU (CycleGAN), 60.62 HU (PSL) and 57.28 HU (NDCT). As for the low-contrast lesion detectability quantification, the CNR were calculated to be 0.202 (LDCT), 0.356 (TV), 0.372 (N2V), 0.383 (CycleGAN), 0.399 (PSL), and 0.359 (NDCT). By visual inspection, we observed that the proposed PSL method can deliver a noise-suppressed and detail-preserved image, while the TV-based method would lead to the blocky artifact, the N2V method would produce over-smoothed structures and CT value biased effect, and the CycleGAN method would generate slightly noisy results with inaccurate CT values. We also verified the generalizability of the PSL method, which exhibited superior denoising performance among various testing datasets with different data distribution shifts. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning-based convolutional neural network can be trained without paired datasets. Qualitatively visual inspection showed the proposed PSL method can achieve superior denoising performance than all the competitors, despite that the employed quantitative metrics in terms of PSNR, SSIM and CNR did not always show consistently better values.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to compare the effects of liposomal bupivacaine (Lipo-B) and bupivacaine hydrochloride (B-HCl), in the presence of multimodal analgesia, on postoperative analgesia and opioid consumption in minimally invasive thoracic surgery (MITS) lobectomy. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary care cancer center. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 60 patients who underwent MITS lobectomy and received intercostal nerve blockade (ICNB) with either 0.66% Lipo-B (n = 29) or 0.5% B-HCl (n = 31). INTERVENTIONS: All patients received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia for the first 12 hours postoperatively, followed by opioids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as needed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Perioperative opioid and nonopioid consumption and pain scores were compared between groups at 12-hour intervals for the first 72 hours. Between the two groups, there were no statistically significant differences in demographic characteristics, intraoperative (p = 0.46) and postoperative opioid consumption, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale scores and pain scores upon postanesthesia care unit arrival and after four hours, length of postanesthesia care unit stay (p = 0.84), or length of hospital stay (p = 0.55). Both groups received intra- and postoperative multimodal analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, no differences in opioid consumption or pain scores were observed in the immediate postoperative period following MITS lobectomy between patients given ICNB with Lipo-B and those given ICNB with B-HCl in the presence of multimodal analgesia.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect that particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mug (PM2.5) had on mortality in Asian populations in years 2000-2015. SETTING: Mortality and level of PM2.5 data from the United Nations, Global Burden of Disease and University of Chicago were used. OUTCOME MEASURES: Age pattern of mortality and the number of life-years lost (LYL) attributable to PM2.5 in years 2000-2015. LYL were further separated into causes of death to quantify the contribution of each cause. RESULTS: Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality increased to represent over 31% of the LYL attributable to PM2.5 between 2005-2010 and 2010-2015 in Asia (females 31% and males 35%). However, great diversity in LYL attributable to PM2.5 by causes-of-death were found across the region, with IHD proportions of LYL ranging from 25% to 63% for males from Eastern and Central Asia, respectively. Similar diversity was observed for mortality attributable to PM2.5 for other causes of death across Asia: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (LYL ranging from 6% to 28%), lung cancer (4% to 20%) and stroke (11% to 22%). CONCLUSION: PM2.5 is a crucial component in the rising health effects in Asia. The diverse trends in cause-specific mortality attributable to PM2.5 creates a further challenge for health systems in the region. These findings highlight that immediate interventions are needed to mitigate the increasing levels of air pollution and with that reduce its detrimental effect on the health and mortality of Asian populations.",nocancer
"Nanoparticles are interesting area of research developed for several diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Tamarind flower extract is rich in Xyloglucan, a starch like polysaccharide which promotes proliferation and various application areas like drug-delivery technology. In recent years researchers are evaluating nanoliposome using in vitro and in vivo studies to discover their biomedical applications. Considering the importance and feasibility of nanoliposome, the present study is focused on synthesis of liposomes via biological method. The biological molecules of Tamarindus indica flower were used for the synthesis of nanoliposome. The synthesized Tamarindus indica flower extract lipid nanoparticles (TifeLiNPs) loaded with xyloglucans were characterized and evaluated for therapeutic applications (antibacterial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities) under in vitro condition. UV-Vis spectral analysis revealed the emission of peak at 232 nm. Further, the chemical characterization using FTIR revealed the presence of components in the functional group. EDX analysis exhibited the presence of O, Na, P and Cl, while DLS confirmed bilayer formation of xyloglucan and liposomes with uniform size (70-80 nm) and spherical shape. The Physicochemical characterization of tamarind flower extract for its chemical composition revealed the presence of carbohydrates, alkaloids, terpenoids, glycosides, saponins, tannins and flavonoids in confirmatory test. Presence of carbohydrate polymers such as rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, glucose and xylose revealed using high performance anion exchange (HPAE) chromatography under basic conditions on an ion chromatographic system were measured using Pulsed Amperometric Detection (PAD). The synthesized nanoliposome evaluated against Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria showed potential antibacterial activity. TifeLiNPs demonstrated significant in vitro antioxidant potential, antidiabetic, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activity. Overall, the present study exhibited the potential application of TifeLiNPs for biomedical purposes.",nocancer
"Aim This study evaluates the feasibility of handheld vital microscopy for noninvasive, objective assessment of the microcirculation of the human uterine cervix. We qualitatively and quantitatively describe the microcirculation in healthy subjects in order to provide a basis for its application in cervical pathology. METHODS: Incident dark field imaging was used to image the microcirculation in four quadrants of the uterine ectocervix in ten healthy participants. If the squamocolumnar junction was visible, measurements were repeated on the endocervical columnar epithelium as well. Image acquisition time was recorded and participants scored the experienced level of discomfort. Angioarchitecture was classified according to Weber's classification. Quantitative parameters included capillary density (CD), total and perfused vessel density (TVD, PVD), proportion of perfused vessels (PPV) and microvascular flow index (MFI). RESULTS: Image acquisition was easy, fast and well tolerated. Angioarchitecture was characterized by two distinctive and organized patterns; capillary loops underneath the squamous epithelium of the ectocervix and vascular networks underneath the columnar epithelium. In the image sequences containing capillary loops, mean CD was 33.2 cpll/mm2 (95% CI 28.2 - 38.2 cpll/mm2). In the image sequences with vascular networks, mean TVD was 12.5 mm/mm2 (95% CI 11.2 - 13.77 mm/mm2), mean PVD was 12.2 (95% CI 11.0 - 13.5 mm/mm2), MFI was 3 and PPV was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Incident dark field imaging allows for noninvasive, real time visualization and objective evaluation and quantification of the microcirculation of the uterine cervix. The organized vascular patterns and optimal perfusion observed in healthy subjects allow for comparison with cervical pathology, for example in patients with cervical dysplasia or cervical cancer.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: The 2015 Sustainable Development Goals include the objective of reducing premature mortality from major non-communicable diseases (NCDs) by one-third by 2030. Accomplishing this objective has demographic implications with relevance for countries' health systems and costs. However, evidence on the system-wide implications of NCD targets is limited. METHODS: We developed a cohort-component model to estimate demographic change based on user-defined disease-specific mortality trajectories. The model accounts for ageing over 101 annual age cohorts, disaggregated by sex and projects changes in the size and structure of the population. We applied this model to the context of Bangladesh, using the model to simulate demographic outlooks for Bangladesh for 2015-2030 using three mortality scenarios. The 'status quo' scenario entails that the disease-specific mortality profile observed in 2015 applies throughout 2015-2030. The 'trend' scenario adopts age-specific, sex-specific and disease-specific mortality rate trajectories projected by WHO for the region. The 'target' scenario entails a one-third reduction in the mortality rates of cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases between age 30 and 70 by 2030. RESULTS: The status quo, trend and target scenarios projected 178.9, 179.7 and 180.2 million population in 2030, respectively. The cumulative number of deaths during 2015-2030 was estimated at 17.4, 16.2 and 15.6 million for each scenario, respectively. During 2015-2030, the target scenario would avert a cumulative 1.73 million and 584 000 all-cause deaths compared with the status quo and trend scenarios, respectively. Male life expectancy was estimated to increase from 71.10 to 73.47 years in the trend scenario and to 74.38 years in the target scenario; female life expectancy was estimated to increase from 73.68 to 75.34 years and 76.39 years in the trend and target scenarios, respectively. CONCLUSION: The model describes the demographic implications of NCD prevention and control targets, estimating the potential increase in life expectancy associated with achieving key NCD reduction targets. The results can be used to inform future health system needs and to support planning for increased healthcare coverage in countries.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Although some studies have explored the effects of responses to COVID-19 on mortality, there are limited data on their effects on more immediate health risk factors and the trends of chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: To explore the prevalence of some behavioral health risk factors, intermediate risk factors, and chronic diseases at different timepoints during 2020 using the data available from a currently used surveillance system in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This study undertook a secondary analysis of data from the Sharik Health Indicators Surveillance System (SHISS). The SHISS employs short cross-sectional phone interviews, conducted in all 13 administrative regions of Saudi Arabia on a quarterly basis. Each interview lasts approximately 4 min and is conducted by a trained data collector. The SHISS collects demographic data, as well as data on the major behavioral and intermediate chronic disease risk factors and the major chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, stroke, cancer, and chronic respiratory diseases. RESULTS: Of the 44,782 potential participants contacted in 2020, 30,134 completed the interview, with a response rate of 67.29%. Out of the total participants, 51.2% were female. The mean age was 36.5. The behavioral risk factors in this period exhibited significant changes compared to those in the first quarter (Q1) of 2020, when there were no significant restrictions on daily activities. These significant changes are related to reductions in fruit and vegetable intake (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 0.23) and physical activity (AOR, 0.483), and a significant increase in e-cigarette use (AOR 1.531). In terms of the intermediate risk factors observed in the SHISS, significant increases in hypercholesterolemia (AOR, 1.225) and hypertension (AOR, 1.190) were observed. Finally, heart disease (AOR, 1.279) and diabetes (AOR, 1.138) displayed significant increases compared to Q1. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows some evidence of the impact of responses to COVID-19 on the health of the population in Saudi Arabia. Significant reductions in fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity, and significant increases in e-cigarette use, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia may increase the burden of chronic diseases in Saudi Arabia in the near future. Thus, continuous monitoring of the health risk factors within the population, and early interventions, are recommended to prevent future increases in chronic diseases.",nocancer
"The problem of chemoresistance development is an inescapable flipside of modern oncotherapy, in particular for solorectal cancer patients. The search for or development of drugs effective against resistant tumors involves the use of model resistant cell lines in vitro. To obtain such lines, we reproduced the development of chemoresistance of human colon adenocarcinoma cells under the treatment with drugs of different mechanisms, a cytostatic (paclitaxel) and a targeted agent (Nutlin-3a, an inhibitor of p53-Mdm2 protein-protein interaction). In each case, we gradually increased the content of the substance in the medium, starting from effective concentrations that do not cause total cell death. When studying the lines resistant to the corresponding drug, we noted a reduced sensitivity to the drug of another mechanism of action. Analysis of the original and resistant lines showed that the cells use the universal efflux defense mechanism. The observed effect can be partially neutralized using inhibitors of the ABC transport proteins, including P-glycoprotein, known for its oncoprotective function. The role of the latter was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting.",nocancer
"Water lily (Nuphar) bioactive extracts have been widely used in traditional medicine owing to their multiple applications against human ailments. Phyto-active Nuphar extracts and their purified and synthetic derivatives have attracted the attention of ethnobotanists and biochemists. Here, we report that 6,6'-dihydroxythiobinupharidine (DTBN), purified from extracts of Nuphar lutea (L.) Sm. leaves, is an effective inhibitor of the kinase activity of members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family using in vitro and in silico approaches. We demonstrate that members of the conventional subfamily of PKCs, PKCalpha and PKCgamma, were more sensitive to DTBN inhibition as compared to novel or atypical PKCs. Molecular docking analysis demonstrated the interaction of DTBN, with the kinase domain of PKCs depicting the best affinity towards conventional PKCs, in accordance with our in vitro kinase activity data. The current study reveals novel targets for DTBN activity, functioning as an inhibitor for PKCs kinase activity. Thus, this and other data indicate that DTBN modulates key cellular signal transduction pathways relevant to disease biology, including cancer.",nocancer
"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has led to a pandemic since March 2020. The exact pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and role of each component of innate and adaptive immune system is still unknown. However, available data from other corona virus families, such as SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and also new findings could be useful for better understanding of SARS-CoV-2. Toll-like receptors (TLR) play an important role in recognition of viral particles and activation of innate immune system. Activation of TLR pathways lead to secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, as well as type 1 interferon. Different TLRs, like TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR6, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are potentially important in COVID-19 infection. It is also worth mentioning that we should not forget both beneficial and harmful effects of TLR in confronting COVID-19 infection. TLRs could be a potential target in controlling the infection in early stages of disease and production of vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. This article is protected by copyright.

"OBJECTIVE: To develop prognostic models for survival (alive or deceased status) prediction of COVID-19 patients using clinical data (demographics and history, laboratory tests, visual scoring by radiologists) and lung/lesion radiomic features extracted from chest CT images. METHODS: Overall, 152 patients were enrolled in this study protocol. These were divided into 106 training/validation and 46 test datasets (untouched during training), respectively. Radiomic features were extracted from the segmented lungs and infectious lesions separately from chest CT images. Clinical data, including patients' history and demographics, laboratory tests and radiological scores were also collected. Univariate analysis was first performed (q-value reported after false discovery rate (FDR) correction) to determine the most predictive features among all imaging and clinical data. Prognostic modeling of survival was performed using radiomic features and clinical data, separately or in combination. Maximum relevance minimum redundancy (MRMR) and XGBoost were used for feature selection and classification. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were used to assess the prognostic performance of the models on the test datasets. RESULTS: For clinical data, cancer comorbidity (q-value < 0.01), consciousness level (q-value < 0.05) and radiological score involved zone (q-value < 0.02) were found to have high correlated features with outcome. Oxygen saturation (AUC = 0.73, q-value < 0.01) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (AUC = 0.72, q-value = 0.72) were identified as high clinical features. For lung radiomic features, SAHGLE (AUC = 0.70) and HGLZE (AUC = 0.67) from GLSZM were identified as most prognostic features. Amongst lesion radiomic features, RLNU from GLRLM (AUC = 0.73), HGLZE from GLSZM (AUC = 0.73) had the highest performance. In multivariate analysis, combining lung, lesion and clinical features was determined to provide the most accurate prognostic model (AUC = 0.95 +- 0.029 (95%CI: 0.95-0.96), accuracy = 0.88 +- 0.046 (95% CI: 0.88-0.89), sensitivity = 0.88 +- 0.066 (95% CI = 0.87-0.9) and specificity = 0.89 +- 0.07 (95% CI = 0.87-0.9)). CONCLUSION: Combination of radiomic features and clinical data can effectively predict outcome in COVID-19 patients. The developed model has significant potential for improved management of COVID-19 patients.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Current prostate brachytherapy uses transrectal ultrasound images for implant guidance, where contours of the prostate and organs-at risk are necessary for treatment planning and dose evaluation. This work aims to develop a deep learning-based method for male pelvic multi-organ segmentation on transrectal ultrasound images. METHODS: We developed an anchor-free mask convolutional neural network (CNN) that consists of three subnetworks, i.e., a backbone, a fully convolutional one-state object detector (FCOS), and a mask head. The backbone extracts multi-level and multi-scale features from an US image. The FOCS utilizes these features to detect and label (classify) the volume-of-interests (VOIs) of organs. In contrast to the design of a previously investigated mask regional CNN (Mask R-CNN), the FCOS is anchor-free, which can capture the spatial correlation of multiple organs. The mask head performs segmentation on each detected VOI, where a spatial attention strategy is integrated into the mask head to focus on informative feature elements and suppress noise. For evaluation, we retrospectively investigated 83 prostate cancer patients by a five-fold cross-validation and a hold-out test. The prostate, bladder, rectum and urethra were segmented and compared with manual contours using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95 ), mean surface distance (MSD), center of mass distance (CMD) and volume difference (VD). RESULTS: The proposed method visually outperforms two competing methods, showing better agreement with manual contours and fewer misidentified speckles. In the cross-validation study, the respective DSC and HD95 results were as follows for each organ: bladder 0.75+-0.12, 2.58+-0.7 mm; prostate 0.93+-0.03, 2.28+-0.64 mm; rectum 0.90+-0.07, 1.65+-0.52 mm; and urethra 0.86+-0.07, 1.85+-1.71 mm. For the hold-out tests, the DSC and HD95 results were as follows: bladder 0.76+-0.13, 2.93+-1.29 mm; prostate 0.94+-0.03, 2.27+-0.79 mm; rectum 0.92+-0.03, 1.90+-0.28 mm; and urethra 0.85+-0.06, 1.81+-0.72 mm. Segmentation was performed in under 5 seconds. CONCLUSION: The proposed method demonstrated fast and accurate multi-organ segmentation performance. It can expedite the contouring step of prostate brachytherapy and potentially enable auto-planning and auto-evaluation.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: A recent phase III trial did not confirm the previous clinical and endoscopic improvements seen in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) receiving Mongersen, an oral Smad7 antisense oligonucleotide. Factors accounting for such a discrepancy are unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to further assess whether Mongersen was effective as induction therapy in active CD and evaluate the in vitro inhibitory effect of various batches of Mongersen used in the previous and present trials on Smad7 expression. METHODS: In a phase II, open-label study, 18 patients with active CD (Crohn's Disease Activity Index [CDAI] score > 220 and evidence of endoscopic lesions) received Mongersen 160 mg/day for 12 weeks. The rates of clinical remission, defined as CDAI < 150, and clinical response, defined as a CDAI score decrease >= 100, were evaluated at week 4, 8, and 12. The fraction of circulating CCR9-expressing leukocytes was assessed by flow cytometry. Smad7 expression was evaluated in the human colorectal cancer cell line HCT-116 transfected with different batches of Mongersen using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting, RESULTS: The proportions of patients experiencing clinical remission were 38.9%, 55.6%, and 50.0% at week 4, 8, and 12, respectively. At the same time points, the rates of clinical response were 72.2%, 77.8%, and 77.8%, respectively. Mongersen reduced the percentages of CCR9-expressing CD45+ cells. The batch of Mongersen used in this study, but not two batches used in the phase III study, inhibited Smad7 expression in HCT-116 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings support the clinical benefit of Mongersen in active CD and show that various batches manufactured during the GED0301 program differ in their ability to inhibit in vitro Smad7.

"Background and Objective: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the most painful procedures and perioperative pain usually requires the use of many analgesics to relieve it. The appropriate use of analgesics to relieve patient pain is an important issue of TKA. To characterize the drug utilization for pain management during perioperative period of TKA in China using real-world data of electronic medical records. Materials and Methods: This research used the data of all inpatients who received TKA at 145 hospitals covered 31 provinces in China from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018. The exclusion criteria included pregnancy and cancer diagnosis. In the analysis of drug utilization mode (DUM), medicines were classified into 5 groups: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, non-opioid central analgesics, acetaminophen and others. Results: Among the 2017 patients included in this study, there were 1537 (76.20%) female and 480 (23.80%) male, aged 65.77 +- 7.73 years. Regarding the surgery characteristics, 1658 (82.20%) were unilateral; 1220 (60.49%) was graded Level 4; 1312 (65.05%) used local anesthesia as the main anesthesia method, and 1450 (71.89%) lasted for more than 2 h. The most common DUM was ""NSAIDs + opioids"" (55.92%), followed by ""NSAIDs only"" (17.85%), and ""NSAIDs + Opioids + Non-opioid central analgesics"" (17.15%). The results of the Chi-square test showed that differences in DUM were associated with surgery types, surgery levels, surgery duration, and types of anesthesia used. Up to 81.14% of the total drug expenses for pain management was spent on NSAIDs. Due to the limitation of database, this study could not subdivide operation stages, anesthesia methods, dosage forms of drugs. Conclusion: In China, the use of analgesics in perioperative period of TKA was diversified and influenced by a number of surgery characteristics. The rational use of analgesics should be considered in combination with surgery type, surgery level, surgery duration and anesthesia method.",nocancer
"In this community-based cohort study, we investigated the relationship between combinations of modifiable lifestyle risk factors and infectious disease mortality. Participants were 468,569 men and women (56.5 +- 8.1, 54.6% women) residing in the United Kingdom. Lifestyle indexes included traditional and emerging lifestyle risk factors based on health guidelines and best practice recommendations for: physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep quality, diet quality, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. The main outcome was mortality from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations among combinations of lifestyle risk factors was inversely associated with mortality. Hazard ratios ranged between 0.26 (0.23-0.30) to 0.69 (0.60-0.79) for infectious disease and pneumonia. Among participants with pre-existing cardiovascular disease or cancer, hazard ratios ranged between 0.30 (0.25-0.34) to 0.73 (0.60-0.89). COVID-19 mortality risk ranged between 0.42 (0.28-0.63) to 0.75 (0.49-1.13). We found a beneficial dose-response association with a higher lifestyle index against mortality that was consistent across sex, age, BMI, and socioeconomic status. There was limited evidence of synergistic interactions between most lifestyle behaviour pairs, suggesting that the dose-response relationship among different lifestyle behaviours is not greater than the sum of the risk induced by each behaviour. Improvements in lifestyle risk factors and meeting public health guidelines or best practice recommendations could be used as an ancillary measure to ameliorate infectious disease mortality.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To describe clinical characteristics and associated endometrial findings of transgender and gender nonbinary people using gender-affirming testosterone. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: Academic medical center and public safety net hospital. PATIENT(S): Eighty-one patients using gender-affirming testosterone therapy undergoing hysterectomy for the indication of gender affirmation from 2000 to 2018. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Preoperative clinical characteristics and endometrium surgical pathology diagnoses. RESULT(S): Median age was 31 years (interquartile range [IQR] 27-40), and median body mass index 27 kg/m2 (IQR 24-30). Six patients (7%) were parous and 60 (74%) had amenorrhea. Thirty-three patients (40%) had proliferative and 40 (50%) atrophic endometrium. Endometrial polyps were found in nine patients (11%) of the sample. Endometrial findings were similar in the subgroup of 60 patients with preoperative amenorrhea. There were no cases of endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy. In bivariate analysis, those with proliferative endometrium were found to be, on average, 5.6 years younger than those with atrophic endometrium. There were no clinical factors associated with having proliferative versus atrophic endometrium in multivariable models. CONCLUSION(S): People using gender-affirming testosterone may have either proliferative or atrophic endometrium, including people who present with amenorrhea. Further study is needed to develop evidence-based guidelines for appropriate screening for endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in this population.",nocancer
"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) 1-3 are well-known multi-domain enzymes, catalysing the covalent modification of proteins, DNA, and themselves. They attach mono- or poly-ADP-ribose to targets using NAD+ as a substrate. Poly-ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) is central to the important functions of PARP enzymes in the DNA damage response and nucleosome remodelling. Activation of PARP happens through DNA binding via zinc fingers and/or the WGR domain. Modulation of their activity using PARP inhibitors occupying the NAD+ binding site has proven successful in cancer therapies. For decades, studies set out to elucidate their full-length molecular structure and activation mechanism. In the last five years, significant advances have progressed the structural and functional understanding of PARP1-3, such as understanding allosteric activation via inter-domain contacts, how PARP senses damaged DNA in the crowded nucleus, and the complementary role of histone PARylation factor 1 in modulating the active site of PARP. Here, we review these advances together with the versatility of PARP domains involved in DNA binding, the targets and shape of PARylation and the role of PARPs in nucleosome remodelling.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials have sought to develop evidence-based messages to reduce COVID-19 transmission by communicating key information to media outlets and the public. We describe the development of an interdisciplinary rapid message testing model to quickly create, test, and share messages with public health officials for use in health campaigns and policy briefings. METHODS: An interdisciplinary research team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assembled in March 2020 to assist the state health department in developing evidence-based messages to influence social distancing behaviors in the state. We developed and iteratively executed a rapid message testing model; the components of the 4-step model were message creation, survey development, survey administration, and analysis and presentation to health department officials. The model was executed 4 times, each during a 7-day period in April and May, and each subsequent survey included new phrasing and/or messaging informed by the previous week's survey. A total of 917 adults from North Carolina participated in the 4 surveys. RESULTS: Survey participants rated messages focused on protecting oneself and others higher than messages focused on norms and fear-based approaches. Pairing behaviors with motivations increased participants' desire to social distance across all themes and subgroups. For example, adding ""Protect your grandmother, your neighbor with cancer, and your best friend with asthma,"" to messaging received a 0.9-point higher score than the base message, ""Stay 6 feet apart from others when out in public."" PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Our model to promote social distancing in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used for rapid, iterative message testing during public health emergencies.",nocancer
"Mounting evidence support the potential benefits of functional foods or nutraceuticals for human health and diseases. Black cumin (Nigella sativa L.), a highly valued nutraceutical herb with a wide array of health benefits, has attracted growing interest from health-conscious individuals, the scientific community, and pharmaceutical industries. The pleiotropic pharmacological effects of black cumin, and its main bioactive component thymoquinone (TQ), have been manifested by their ability to attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation, and to promote immunity, cell survival, and energy metabolism, which underlie diverse health benefits, including protection against metabolic, cardiovascular, digestive, hepatic, renal, respiratory, reproductive, and neurological disorders, cancer, and so on. Furthermore, black cumin acts as an antidote, mitigating various toxicities and drug-induced side effects. Despite significant advances in pharmacological benefits, this miracle herb and its active components are still far from their clinical application. This review begins with highlighting the research trends in black cumin and revisiting phytochemical profiles. Subsequently, pharmacological attributes and health benefits of black cumin and TQ are critically reviewed. We overview molecular pharmacology to gain insight into the underlying mechanism of health benefits. Issues related to pharmacokinetic herb-drug interactions, drug delivery, and safety are also addressed. Identifying knowledge gaps, our current effort will direct future research to advance potential applications of black cumin and TQ in health and diseases.",nocancer
"Inspired by the success of dual-targeting drugs, especially bispecific antibodies, we propose to combine the concept of proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) and dual targeting to design and synthesize dual PROTAC molecules with the function of degrading two completely different types of targets simultaneously. A library of novel dual-targeting PROTAC molecules has been rationally designed and prepared. A convergent synthetic strategy has been utilized to achieve high synthetic efficiency. These dual PROTAC structures are characterized using trifunctional natural amino acids as star-type core linkers to connect two independent inhibitors and E3 ligands together. In this study, gefitinib, olaparib, and CRBN or VHL E3 ligands were used as substrates to synthesize novel dual PROTACs. They successfully degraded both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) simultaneously in cancer cells. Being the first successful example of dual PROTACs, this technique will greatly widen the range of application of the PROTAC method and open up a new field for drug discovery.",nocancer
"High mobility group A2 (HMGA2) is a chromatin-associated protein involved in the regulation of stem cell function, embryogenesis and cancer development. Although the protein does not contain a consensus SUMOylation site, it is shown to be SUMOylated. In this study, we demonstrate that the first lysine residue in the reported K66KAE SUMOylation motif in HMGA2 can be methylated in vitro and in vivo by the Set7/9 methyltransferase. By editing the lysine, the increased hydrophobicity of the resulting 6-N-methyl-lysine transforms the sequence into a consensus SUMO motif. This post-translational editing dramatically increases the subsequent SUMOylation of this site. Furthermore, similar putative methylation-dependent SUMO motifs are found in a number of other chromatin factors, and we confirm methylation-dependent SUMOylation of a site in one such protein, the Polyhomeotic complex 1 homolog (PHC1). Together, these results suggest that crosstalk between methylation and SUMOylation is a general mode for regulation of chromatin function.",nocancer
"Since its discovery in 1981, the Ku complex has been extensively studied under multiple cellular contexts, with most work focusing on Ku in terms of its essential role in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). In this process, Ku is well-known as the DNA-binding subunit for DNA-PK, which is central to the NHEJ repair process. However, in addition to the extensive study of Ku's role in DNA repair, Ku has also been implicated in various other cellular processes including transcription, the DNA damage response, DNA replication, telomere maintenance, and has since been studied in multiple contexts, growing into a multidisciplinary point of research across various fields. Some advances have been driven by clarification of Ku's structure, including the original Ku crystal structure and the more recent Ku-DNA-PKcs crystallography, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryoEM) studies, and the identification of various post-translational modifications. Here, we focus on the advances made in understanding the Ku heterodimer outside of non-homologous end-joining, and across a variety of model organisms. We explore unique structural and functional aspects, detail Ku expression, conservation, and essentiality in different species, discuss the evidence for its involvement in a diverse range of cellular functions, highlight Ku protein interactions and recent work concerning Ku-binding motifs, and finally, we summarize the clinical Ku-related research to date.",nocancer
"AIM: Ileostomy formation is a commonly performed procedure with substantial associated morbidity. Patients with an ileostomy experience high rates of unplanned hospital readmission with dehydration and such events have long term health and economic impact. Reports of the significant risk factors associated with these readmissions have been inconsistent. This study aimed to identify the significant risk factors for readmission with dehydration following ileostomy formation. METHOD: A systematic search was conducted using the Medline, Embase, Cochrane and CINAHL databases. All original research articles reporting risk factors for readmission with dehydration following ileostomy formation in adults were included. The primary outcome was the pooled risk ratio of clinically relevant variables potentially associated with dehydration-related readmissions following ileostomy formation. The secondary outcome was the incidence of dehydration-related readmissions. RESULTS: Ten studies (27,089 patients) were included. The incidences of 30- and 60-day readmission with dehydration were 5.0% (range: 2.1-13.2%) and 10.3% (range: 7.3-14.1%), respectively. Eight variables were found to be significantly associated with dehydration-related readmissions: age >=65 years, body mass index >=30kg/m2 , diabetes mellitus, hypertension, renal comorbidity, regular diuretic use, ileal-pouch-anal-anastomosis procedure and index admission length of stay. A pre-operative diagnosis of colorectal cancer was less likely to result in readmission with dehydration. CONCLUSIONS: Readmission with dehydration following ileostomy formation is a significant issue with several risk factors. Awareness of these risk factors will help inform the design of future studies addressing risk prediction, allow risk stratification of ileostomates and aid in the development of personalised prevention strategies.",nocancer
"Patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) become critically ill primarily around the time of activation of the adaptive immune response. Here, we provide evidence that antibodies play a role in the worsening of disease at the time of seroconversion. We show that early phase severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein-specific IgG in serum of critically ill COVID-19 patients induces excessive inflammatory responses by human alveolar macrophages. We identified that this excessive inflammatory response is dependent on two antibody features that are specific for patients with severe COVID-19. First, inflammation is driven by high titers of anti-spike IgG, a hallmark of severe disease. Second, we found that anti-spike IgG from patients with severe COVID-19 is intrinsically more pro-inflammatory because of different glycosylation, particularly low fucosylation, of the antibody Fc tail. Notably, low fucosylation of anti-spike IgG was normalized in a few weeks after initial infection with SARS-CoV-2, indicating that the increased antibody-dependent inflammation mainly occurs at the time of seroconversion. We identified Fcgamma Receptor (FcgammaR) IIa and FcgammaRIII as the two primary IgG receptors that are responsible for the induction of key COVID-19-associated cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. In addition, we show that anti-spike IgG-activated human macrophages can subsequently break pulmonary endothelial barrier integrity and induce microvascular thrombosis in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate that the inflammatory response induced by anti-spike IgG can be specifically counteracted by fostamatinib, an FDA- and EMA-approved therapeutic small molecule inhibitor of Syk kinase.",nocancer
"Circular nuclear receptor interacting protein 1 (circNRIP1) is implicated in tumor initiation and progression; however, the underlying mechanism of keloid progression is unclear. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to characterize the contribution of circNRIP1 to keloid progression and evaluate the potential underlying molecular mechanisms using keloid-derived fibroblasts. The expression profile of circNRIP1 was confirmed in keloid tissue. The contribution of circNRIP1 to keloid progression was investigated via loss-of-function assays. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism by which circNRIP1 contributes to pre-microRNA (miR)-503 maturation through blocking Fbxo4-mediated Fragile-X mental retardation 1 (FXR1) ubiquitination was verified. Finally, the biological functions of FXR1, miR-503-3p, and miR-503-5p in keloid-derived fibroblast proliferation, apoptosis and extracellular matrix accumulation were confirmed. circNRIP1 was highly expressed in keloid tissue and keloid-derived fibroblasts. Functional analysis showed that circNRIP1 knockdown successfully blocked the proliferation and expression of extracellular matrix-associated proteins while increasing the rate of apoptosis in keloid-derived fibroblasts. Mechanistically, circNRIP1 maintained FXR1 stability by impeding Fbxo4-mediated FXR1 ubiquitination and degradation. Additionally, FXR1 increased the abundance of miR-503-3p and miR-503-5p by contributing to pre-miR-503 maturation. Knockdown of FXR1, miR-503-3p and miR-503-5p also inhibited proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation in keloid-derived fibroblasts and increased levels of cell apoptosis. Collectively, the present study confirmed that circNRIP1 contributed to pre-miR-503 maturation via blocking Fbxo4-mediated FXR1 ubiquitination and degradation, which facilitates keloid progression. These results indicate that circNRIP1 has potential as a novel therapeutic target for the control and/or treatment of keloids.",nocancer
"Sirtuins are signaling hubs orchestrating the cellular response to various stressors with roles in all major civilization diseases. Sirtuins remove acyl groups from lysine residues of proteins, thereby controlling their activity, turnover, and localization. The seven human sirtuins, SirT1-7, are closely related in structure, hindering the development of specific inhibitors. Screening 170,000 compounds, we identify and optimize SirT1-specific benzoxazine inhibitors, Sosbo, which rival the efficiency and surpass the selectivity of selisistat (EX527). The compounds inhibit the deacetylation of p53 in cultured cells, demonstrating their ability to permeate biological membranes. Kinetic analysis of inhibition and docking studies reveal that the inhibitors bind to a complex of SirT1 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, similar to selisistat. These new SirT1 inhibitors are valuable alternatives to selisistat in biochemical and cell biological studies. Their greater selectivity may allow the development of better targeted drugs to combat SirT1 activity in diseases such as cancer, Huntington's chorea, or anorexia.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 causes severe illness and multi-organ dysfunction. An abnormal electrocardiogram is associated with poor outcome, and QT prolongation during the illness has been linked to pharmacological effects. This study sought to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 illness on the corrected QT interval (QTc). METHOD: For 293 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital via the emergency department for COVID-19 between 01/03/20 - 18/05/20, demographic data, laboratory findings, admission electrocardiograph and clinical observations were compared in those who survived and those who died within 6 weeks. Hospital records were reviewed for prior electrocardiograms for comparison with those recorded on presentation with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients who died were older than survivors (82 vs 69.8 years, p<0.001), more likely to have cancer (22.3% vs 13.1%, p = 0.034), dementia (25.6% vs 10.7%, p = 0.034) and ischaemic heart disease (27.8% vs 10.7%, p<0.001). Deceased patients exhibited higher levels of C-reactive protein (244.6mg/L vs 146.5mg/L, p<0.01), troponin (1982.4ng/L vs 413.4 ng/L, p = 0.017), with a significantly longer QTc interval (461.1ms vs 449.3ms, p = 0.007). Pre-COVID electrocardiograms were located for 172 patients; the QTc recorded on presentation with COVID-19 was longer than the prior measurement in both groups, but was more prolonged in the deceased group (448.4ms vs 472.9ms, pre-COVID vs COVID, p<0.01). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed age, C-reactive protein and prolonged QTc of >455ms (males) and >465ms (females) (p = 0.028, HR 1.49 [1.04-2.13]), as predictors of mortality. QTc prolongation beyond these dichotomy limits was associated with increased mortality risk (p = 0.0027, HR 1.78 [1.2-2.6]). CONCLUSION: QTc prolongation occurs in COVID-19 illness and is associated with poor outcome. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",nocancer
"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies lead to high clinical response rates in B cell malignancies, and are under investigation for treatment of solid tumors. While high systemic interleukin- (IL-) 6 levels are associated with clinical cytokine release syndrome (CRS), the role of IL-6 trans-signaling within CAR T-cells has not been reported. We generated CAR T cells that constitutively express hyper IL-6 (HIL-6), a designer cytokine that activates the trans-signaling pathway. HIL-6-expressing CAR T-cells exhibited enhanced proliferation and antitumor efficacy in vitro and in xenograft models. However, HIL-6 CAR T cells caused severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Transcriptomic profiling revealed that HIL-6 stimulation of CAR T cells upregulated genes associated with T cell migration, early memory differentiation, and IL-6/GP130/STAT3 signaling. Since IL-6 trans-signaling acts via surface GP130, we generated CAR T cells expressing a constitutively-active form of GP130 and found these retained improved antitumor activity without signs of GVHD in preclinical models of B-cell leukemia and solid tumors. Taken together, these results show that IL-6 trans-signaling can enhance expansion and antitumor activity of CAR T cells via the GP130/STAT3 pathway, and suggest that expression of GP130 within CAR T cells could lead to improved antitumor efficacy without systemic IL-6 trans-signaling.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Urological service provision has changed dramatically with the advent of the SARS-CoV-2, necessitating restructuring and reorganization. The aim of this study was to review the reorganization of our unit, map the change in volume of departmental activities and discuss potential solutions. METHODS: Departmental activities over the months of April and May 2020 and 2019 were analysed. Details of admissions, operations, diagnostic procedures, outpatient reviews, morbidities and mortalities were recorded. Operations were performed on two sites, with elective operation transferred to an offsite, COVID-free hospital. RESULTS: Seventy-four emergency operations were performed onsite, with 85 elective operations outsourced. A total of 159 operations were performed, compared with 280 in the same period in 2019. Five (5.0%) of 101 admitted patients to the COVID hospital contracted COVID-19. No patients outsourced to the COVID-free hospital were infected there. Outpatient referrals to urology service decreased from 928 to 481. There was a 66% decrease in new cancer diagnoses. A virtual review clinic was established, with remaining outpatients reviewed through a telephone clinic platform. CONCLUSION: Compared with 2019, we performed fewer operations and outpatient procedures, had fewer admissions and diagnosed fewer patients with new cancers. However, outsourcing elective operation to designated non-COVID hospitals prevented the infection of any patient with COVID-19 in the post-operative period. The use of virtual clinic and telephone clinic has had some success in replacing traditional outpatient visits. The overall significant decrease in operative volume will likely precipitate a mismatch between demand and service provision in the coming months, unless capacity is increased.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: Several studies have demonstrated an increased risk of adverse health effects, including reduced lung function and lung cancer among asphalt pavers, which has been related to occupational exposure to contaminants during asphalt paving. Consequently, occupational exposure among asphalt pavers must be reduced. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of hot mix asphalt (HMA) and warm mix asphalt (WMA) paving on occupational exposure levels during road paving in field experiments. Asphalt temperatures when paving with WMA are usually lower than when paving with HMA due to differences in the asphalt's composition and method of application. METHODS: On 11 different road sections, one lane was paved with WMA and one with HMA during the same work shift under approximately identical weather conditions. The weather conditions and asphalt surface temperature were monitored during paving. Fifty-seven samples of fumes and vapor, organic and elemental carbon, amines, and respirable, thoracic, and inhalable particulate matter (PM) fractions were collected by stationary sampling. In addition, 30 samples of fumes and vapor were collected by personal sampling. RESULTS: Compared to paving with HMA, paving with WMA significantly (P < 0.05; paired Student's t-test) reduced the geometric mean (GM) air concentration of asphalt vapor (0.04 versus 0.08 p.p.m.), organic carbon (OC; 0.09 versus 0.18 mg m-3), and respirable PM (0.12 versus 0.22 mg m-3). Additionally, the air concentration of OC correlated strongly with the respirable fraction of PM (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Measured airborne concentrations of respirable PM, OC, and asphalt vapor were lower when paving with WMA than with HMA. Because exposure to airborne contaminants generated during asphalt paving is believed to be responsible for the adverse health effects observed among asphalt pavers, paving with WMA rather than HMA may have health benefits.",nocancer
"Chronic opisthorchiasis caused by Opisthorchis viverrini (O. viverrini) adversely affects human health and is associated with a fatal bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma). Although cats and dogs are known animal reservoir hosts of opisthorchiasis, there is limited information about whether other fish-eating animals are fluke reservoirs. Wetlands along Chi River of Thailand have abundant intermediate host snails and fish for O. viverrini and diverse other animal species. This led to our investigation into whether other fish-eating animals can also become infected and be alternate reservoir hosts for human opisthorchiasis. Our preliminary study focused on the O. viverrini infection status of crab-eating or long-tailed macaques roaming in Kosumpi National Forest Park in Chi River Basin, Kosumpisai District of Mahasarakam Province, and rodents, small residential mammals and fish-eating birds living in Lawa wetland complex of Khon Kaen Province. Fecal samples of each animal were collected and modified formalin ether concentration technique was applied to identify infections. Additionally, participatory epidemiology was used to retrieve information from local communities on opisthorchiasis transmission in these animals. No O. viverrini infection was found in any fecal samples suggesting that monkeys, rodents, small residential mammals and birds in these two wetlands probably do not serve as alternate reservoir hosts of O. viverrini.",nocancer
"In this study, Dendrobium officinale polysaccharide (named DOPS-1) was isolated from the stems of Dendrobium officinale by hot-water extraction, and purified by using Sephadex G-150 column chromatography.

Based on the results of HPLC, GC, Congo red experiment, together with periodate oxidation, Smith degradation, SEM, FT-IR and NMR spectral analysis, it expressed that DOPS-1 was largely composed of mannose, glucose and galacturonic acid in a molar ratio of 3.2:1.3:1. The molecular weight of DOPS-1 was 1530 kDa and the main chain was composed of (1 4)-beta-D-Glcp, (1 4)-beta-D-Manp and 2-O-acetyl-(1 4)-beta-D-Manp. The measurement results of antioxidant activity showed that DOPS-1 had the strong scavenging activities on hydroxyl radicals, DPPH radicals and superoxide radicals and the high reducing ability in vitro.

"Several complexes of general formula [Ru(halide)(eta6-p-cymene)(alpha-diimine)]+, in the form of nitrate, triflate and hexafluorophosphate salts, including a newly synthesized iodide compound, were investigated as potential anticancer drugs and bactericides. NMR and UV-Vis studies evidenced remarkable stability of the complexes in water and cell culture medium. In general, the complexes displayed strong cytotoxicity against A2780 and A549 cancer cell lines with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, and one complex (RUCYN) emerged as the most promising one, with a significant selectivity compared to the non-cancerous HEK293 cell line. A variable affinity of the complexes for BSA and DNA binding was ascertained by spectrophotometry/fluorimetry, circular dichroism, electrophoresis and viscometry. The performance of RUCYN appears associated to enhanced cell internalization, favored by two cyclohexyl substituents, rather than to specific interaction with the evaluated biomolecules. The chloride/iodide replacement, in one case, led to increased cellular uptake and cytotoxicity at the expense of selectivity, and tuned DNA binding towards intercalation. Complexes with iodide or a valproate bioactive fragment exhibited the best antimicrobial profiles.",nocancer
"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been reported to participate in intestinal mucosal defense and repair. However, the precise regulatory mechanisms of H2S in ulcerative colitis (UC) remain unclear. We explored the effects of sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), a donor of H2S, in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats. The pathologic features were determined by analyzing the hematoxylin and eosin-stained samples. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were determined using ELISA. The presence of cystathionine-gamma-lyase (CSE) and light chain 3B (LC3B) were determined using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence (IF) approaches, respectively. Next, we investigated the effects of NaHS in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human colonic smooth muscle cells (H2940). The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined using IF. NOD-like receptor 3 (NLRP3) and CSE were detected using western blot and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Autophagy was determined using western blot, IF, and electron microscopy. NaHS treatment considerably diminished colitis-induced histological injury and proinflammatory cytokine expressions. MPO, CSE, and H2S were downregulated, whereas LC3B was upregulated after NaHS administration in colitic rats. NaHS remarkably attenuated the levels of ROS, CSE, and NLRP3 in LPS-stimulated cells and enhanced autophagy, as was revealed by increased LC3-II-to-LC3-I ratio, elevated LC3, and decreased p62. Importantly, NaHS promoted autophagosome formation in LPS-treated cells. Exogenous H2S ameliorates intestinal injury by downregulating inflammation and activation of autophagy, suggesting the potential of NaHS as a therapeutic agent for UC.",nocancer
"Ceramides are key-role lipids involved in numerous central cellular processes. A plethora of studies have demonstrated that the levels of ceramides in blood circulation are related to different disease states, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, ovarian cancer, multiple sclerosis and others. Herein, a RPLC-MS/MS method for the rapid quantification of ceramides Cer(d18:1/16:0), Cer(d18:1/18:0), Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1) in human blood serum was developed and validated. Different sample preparation strategies including SLE, LLE and QuECheRS were tested with the aim to attain effective, accurate and reproducible determination of ceramides in serum samples. Intra and inter-day accuracy were found to be between 80.0-111% and 87.8-106%, respectively, for all ceramides, while intra and inter-day precision were found to vary from 0.05% to 10.2% %RSD and 2.2% to 14.0% %RSD, respectively. The lower limits of quantification were 2.3 ng/mL for Cer(d18:1/16:0) and Cer(d18:1/18:0) and 1.4 ng/mL for Cer(d18:1/24:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1).

"Purpose: To determine the relationships between postoperative delirium (POD) and postoperative activities of daily living (ADL) and mortality in patients undergoing laryngectomy. We hypothesized that POD would reduce postoperative ADL and increase postoperative mortality. Patients and Methods: The prospective study included older participants (age >=65 y) undergoing total laryngectomy, partial laryngectomy, total laryngectomy plus neck dissection, or partial laryngectomy plus neck dissection under general anesthesia. The diagnosis of delirium was based on the Confusion Assessment Method algorithm, which was administered on postoperative days 1 through 6. ADL were evaluated using the Chinese version of the Index of ADL scale. Follow-up assessments of ADL and mortality were conducted 24 months after surgery. Results: Of 127 participants (aged 70.3 +- 4.1 y), 19 (15.0%) developed POD. POD was not associated with a decrease in ADL after laryngectomy (p=0.599) nor with an increase in postoperative mortality [3/19 (15.8%) vs 12/108 (11.1%), p=0.560, Log rank test]. However, longer surgery duration was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OR, 3.262; 95% CI, 1.261-9.169, p=0.025). Conclusion: POD was not associated with long-term ADL or mortality after laryngectomy. Prolonged surgery was the only factor associated with a higher postoperative mortality rate.",nocancer
"Human natural killer (NK) cells are essential for controlling infection, cancer and fetal development. NK cell functions are modulated by interactions between polymorphic inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and polymorphic HLA-A, -B and -C ligands expressed on tissue cells. All HLA-C alleles encode a KIR ligand and contribute to reproduction and immunity. In contrast, only some HLA-A and -B alleles encode KIR ligands and they focus on immunity. By high-resolution analysis of KIR and HLA-A, -B and -C genes, we show that the Chinese Southern Han are significantly enriched for interactions between inhibitory KIR and HLA-A and -B. This enrichment has had substantial input through population admixture with neighboring populations, who contributed HLA class I haplotypes expressing the KIR ligands B*46:01 and B*58:01, which subsequently rose to high frequency by natural selection. Consequently, over 80% of Southern Han HLA haplotypes encode more than one KIR ligand. Complementing the high number of KIR ligands, the Chinese Southern Han KIR locus combines a high frequency of genes expressing potent inhibitory KIR, with a low frequency of those expressing activating KIR. The Southern Han centromeric KIR region encodes strong, conserved, inhibitory HLA-C specific receptors, and the telomeric region provides a high number and diversity of inhibitory HLA-A and -B specific receptors. In all these characteristics, the Chinese Southern Han represent other East Asians, whose NK cell repertoires are thus enhanced in quantity, diversity and effector strength, likely augmenting resistance to endemic viral infections.",nocancer
