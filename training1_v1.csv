"Germline epigenetic regulation of KILLIN in Cowden and Cowden-like syndrome. CONTEXT: Germline loss-of-function phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) mutations cause 80% of Cowden syndrome, a rare autosomal-dominant disorder (1 in 200,000 live births), characterized by high risks of breast, thyroid, and other cancers. A large heterogeneous group of individuals with Cowden-like syndrome, who have various combinations of Cowden syndrome features but who do not meet Cowden syndrome diagnostic criteria, have PTEN mutations less than 10% of the time, making molecular diagnosis, prediction, genetic counseling, and risk management challenging. Other mechanisms of loss of function such as hypermethylation, which should result in underexpression of PTEN or of KILLIN, a novel tumor suppressor transcribed in the opposite direction, may account for the remainder of Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether germline methylation is found in Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome in individuals lacking germline PTEN mutations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nucleic acids from prospective nested series of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and 50 unaffected individuals without PTEN variants were analyzed for germline methylation and expression of PTEN and KILLIN at the Cleveland Clinic, August 2008-June 2010. Prevalence of component cancers between groups was compared using the Fisher exact test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of germline methylation in PTEN mutation-negative Cowden syndrome and Cowden syndrome-like individuals. Prevalence of component cancers in methylation-positive and PTEN mutation-positive individuals. RESULTS: Of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome, 45 (37%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-45%) showed hypermethylation upstream of PTEN but no transcriptional repression. The germline methylation was found to transcriptionally down-regulate KILLIN by 250-fold (95% CI, 45-14 286; P = .007) and exclusively disrupted TP53 activation of KILLIN by 30% (95% CI, 7%-45%; P = .008). Demethylation treatment increased only KILLIN expression 4.88-fold (95% CI, 1.4-18.1; P = .05). Individuals with KILLIN -promoter methylation had a 3-fold increased prevalence of breast cancer (35/42 vs 24/64; P < .0001) and a greater than 2-fold increase of kidney cancer (4/45 vs 6/155; P = .004) over individuals with germline PTEN mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Germline KILLIN methylation is common among patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and is associated with increased risks of breast and renal cancer over PTEN mutation-positive individuals. These observations need to be replicated.",cancer
"Association of a leukemic stem cell gene expression signature with clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia. CONTEXT: In many cancers, specific subpopulations of cells appear to be uniquely capable of initiating and maintaining tumors. The strongest support for this cancer stem cell model comes from transplantation assays in immunodeficient mice, which indicate that human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driven by self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs). This model has significant implications for the development of novel therapies, but its clinical relevance has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To identify an LSC gene expression signature and test its association with clinical outcomes in AML. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective study of global gene expression (microarray) profiles of LSC-enriched subpopulations from primary AML and normal patient samples, which were obtained at a US medical center between April 2005 and July 2007, and validation data sets of global transcriptional profiles of AML tumors from 4 independent cohorts (n = 1047). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of genes discriminating LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in AML tumors; and association of LSC-specific genes with overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival and with therapeutic response. RESULTS: Expression levels of 52 genes distinguished LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in cell-sorted AML samples. An LSC score summarizing expression of these genes in bulk primary AML tumor samples was associated with clinical outcomes in the 4 independent patient cohorts. High LSC scores were associated with worse overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival among patients with either normal karyotypes or chromosomal abnormalities. For the largest cohort of patients with normal karyotypes (n = 163), the LSC score was significantly associated with overall survival as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.22; log-likelihood P <.001). The absolute risk of death by 3 years was 57% (95% CI, 43%-67%) for the low LSC score group compared with 78% (95% CI, 66%-86%) for the high LSC score group (HR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-2.7]; log-rank P = .002). In another cohort with available data on event-free survival for 70 patients with normal karyotypes, the risk of an event by 3 years was 48% (95% CI, 27%-63%) in the low LSC score group vs 81% (95% CI, 60%-91%) in the high LSC score group (HR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.3-4.5]; log-rank P = .006). In multivariate Cox regression including age, mutations in FLT3 and NPM1, and cytogenetic abnormalities, the HRs for LSC score in the 3 cohorts with data on all variables were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.13; P = .02), 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P = .005), and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.05-1.30; P = .005). CONCLUSION: High expression of an LSC gene signature is independently associated with adverse outcomes in patients with AML.",cancer
"Imatinib plus peginterferon alfa-2a in chronic myeloid leukemia. BACKGROUND: Imatinib (400 mg daily) is considered the best initial therapy for patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase. However, only a minority of patients treated with imatinib have a complete molecular remission. METHODS: We randomly assigned 636 patients with untreated chronic-phase CML to receive imatinib alone at a dose of 400 mg daily, imatinib (400 mg daily) plus cytarabine (20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day on days 15 through 28 of each 28-day cycle) or pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2a (90 mug weekly), or imatinib alone at a dose of 600 mg daily. Molecular and cytogenetic responses, time to treatment failure, overall and event-free survival, and adverse events were assessed. An analysis of molecular response at 12 months was planned. A superior molecular response was defined as a decrease in the ratio of transcripts of the tyrosine kinase gene BCR-ABL to transcripts of ABL of 0.01% or less, corresponding to a reduction of 4 log(10) units or more from the baseline level, as assessed by means of a real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: At 12 months, the rates of cytogenetic response were similar among the four groups. The rate of a superior molecular response was significantly higher among patients receiving imatinib and peginterferon alfa-2a (30%) than among patients receiving 400 mg of imatinib alone (14%) (P=0.001). The rate was significantly higher among patients treated for more than 12 months than among those treated for 12 months or less. Gastrointestinal events were more frequent among patients receiving cytarabine, whereas rash and depression were more frequent among patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with other treatments, the addition of peginterferon alfa-2a to imatinib therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of molecular response in patients with chronic-phase CML.

"Spectrum and prevalence of FP/TMEM127 gene mutations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas. CONTEXT: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are genetically heterogeneous neural crest-derived neoplasms. We recently identified germline mutations of the novel transmembrane-encoding gene FP/TMEM127 in familial and sporadic pheochromocytomas consistent with a tumor suppressor effect. OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence and spectrum of FP/TMEM127 mutations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas and to test the effect of mutations in vitro. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We sequenced the FP/TMEM127 gene in 990 individuals with pheochromocytomas and/or paragangliomas, including 898 previously unreported cases without mutations in other susceptibility genes from 8 independent worldwide referral centers between January 2009 and June 2010. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method was developed to screen for large gene deletions in 545 of these samples. Confocal microscopy of 5 transfected mutant proteins was used to determine their subcellular localization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency and type of FP/TMEM127 mutation or deletion was assessed and correlated with clinical variables; the subcellular localization of 5 overexpressed mutants was compared with wild-type FP/TMEM127 protein. RESULTS: We identified 19 potentially pathogenic FP/TMEM127 germline mutations in 20 independent families, but no large deletions were detected. All mutation carriers had adrenal tumors, including 7 bilateral (P = 2.7 x 10(-4)) and/or with familial disease (5 of 20 samples; P = .005). The median age at disease onset in the FP/TMEM127 mutation group was similar to that of patients without a mutation (41.5 vs 45 years, respectively; P = .54). The most common presentation was that of a single benign adrenal tumor in patients older than 40 years. Malignancy was seen in 1 mutation carrier (5%). Expression of 5 novel FP/TMEM127 mutations in cell lines revealed diffuse localization of the mutant proteins in contrast with the discrete multiorganelle distribution of wild-type TMEM127. CONCLUSIONS: Germline mutations of FP/TMEM127 were associated with pheochromocytoma but not paraganglioma and occurred in an age group frequently excluded from genetic screening algorithms. Disease-associated mutations disrupt intracellular distribution of the FP/TMEM127 protein.",cancer
"The feasibility and efficacy of eccentric exercise with older cancer survivors: a preliminary study. INTRODUCTION: Older individuals who have survived cancer and the commensurate treatment often experience a reduced quality of life in part due to their impaired muscular abilities and deficits in mobility. The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of resistance exercise via negative, eccentrically induced work (RENEW) with older cancer survivors. METHODS: Older cancer survivors with a perception of moderate muscle weakness and fatigue participated in 12 weeks of RENEW. Measures of feasibility included (1) the participant's ability to progress the total amount of work of RENEW; (2) whether peak knee extension torque production became impaired; and (3) whether RENEW induced leg muscle pain as measured on a visual analog scale. The preliminary measure of efficacy included the performance of a timed up-and-go mobility test. RESULTS: The participants significantly increased the total average work per week over the 12 weeks of RENEW. Participants increased (P < .001) their work approximately 3-fold from week 3 (7.6 [5.11 kJ) to week 12 (22.1 [14.8] kJ) without muscle pain over the 12-week RENEW training period. Knee extension peak torque production improved (11%) significantly (P = .02) (pretest: 248 [92] N; posttest: 275 [99] N) after 12 weeks of RENEW. The time to perform the up-and-go test improved (14%) significantly (P < .001) (pretest: 8.4 [2.7]; posttest: 7.2 [2.3] s) after 12 weeks of RENEW, suggesting preliminary efficacy. CONCLUSION: Collectively, RENEW appears feasible and potentially efficacious for older, weak, and fatigued cancer survivors. Implications for Cancer Survivors: The use of eccentric muscle exercise may be ideally suited for older cancer survivors due to its high force and low energetic-cost capabilities.",cancer
"Weight lifting for women at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: Clinical guidelines for breast cancer survivors without lymphedema advise against upper body exercise, preventing them from obtaining established health benefits of weight lifting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate lymphedema onset after a 1-year weight lifting intervention vs no exercise (control) among survivors at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized controlled equivalence trial (Physical Activity and Lymphedema trial) in the Philadelphia metropolitan area of 154 breast cancer survivors 1 to 5 years postunilateral breast cancer, with at least 2 lymph nodes removed and without clinical signs of BCRL at study entry. Participants were recruited between October 1, 2005, and February 2007, with data collection ending in August 2008. INTERVENTION: Weight lifting intervention included a gym membership and 13 weeks of supervised instruction, with the remaining 9 months unsupervised, vs no exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident BCRL determined by increased arm swelling during 12 months (>/=5% increase in interlimb difference). Clinician-defined BCRL onset was also evaluated. Equivalence margin was defined as doubling of lymphedema incidence. RESULTS: A total of 134 participants completed follow-up measures at 1 year. The proportion of women who experienced incident BCRL onset was 11% (8 of 72) in the weight lifting intervention group and 17% (13 of 75) in the control group (cumulative incidence difference [CID], -6.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.2% to 5.2%; P for equivalence = .04). Among women with 5 or more lymph nodes removed, the proportion who experienced incident BCRL onset was 7% (3 of 45) in the weight lifting intervention group and 22% (11 of 49) in the control group (CID, -15.0%; 95% CI, -18.6% to -11.4%; P for equivalence = .003). Clinician-defined BCRL onset occurred in 1 woman in the weight lifting intervention group and 3 women in the control group (1.5% vs 4.4%, P for equivalence = .12). CONCLUSION: In breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, a program of slowly progressive weight lifting compared with no exercise did not result in increased incidence of lymphedema.

"Comparing the volume of gliomas in the brain in FLAIR and post-contrast T1-weighted MRI sequences. The imaging modality used to diagnose and monitor brain gliomas is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with standard protocols including contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image sequences. Many clinical trials are currently using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image sequences to evaluate tumor response to treatment, but it is our hypothesis that FLAIR sequences will detect higher tumor volumes and, therefore, should be the preferred image sequence for this purpose. In this retrospective study, a volumetric analysis was conducted on the post-contrast T1-weighted and FLAIR MR image sequences of 38 patients with confirmed brain gliomas. The two volumes were subsequently found to have a statistically significant positive correlation. The FLAIR volume was also found to be greater than the post-contrast T1-weighted volume in all 38 patients. As a result, FLAIR image sequences provide a more complete characterization of gliomas and may be more beneficial when observing tumor response after treatment.",cancer

"Low-dose aspirin use and performance of immunochemical fecal occult blood tests. CONTEXT: Immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (iFOBTs) are potentially promising tools for colorectal cancer screening. Low-dose aspirin use, which increases the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding, is common in the target population for colorectal cancer screening. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of low-dose aspirin use with the performance of 2 quantitative iFOBTs in a large sample of patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Diagnostic study conducted from 2005 through 2009 at internal medicine and gastroenterology practices in southern Germany including 1979 patients (mean age, 62.1 years): 233 regular users of low-dose aspirin (167 men, 67 women) and 1746 who never used low-dose aspirin (809 men, 937 women). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms (colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma) with 2 quantitative iFOBTs. RESULTS: Advanced neoplasms were found in 24 users (10.3%) and 181 nonusers (10.4%) of low-dose aspirin. At the cut point recommended by the manufacturer, sensitivities of the 2 tests were 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.9%-87.4%) for users compared with 35.9% (95% CI, 28.9%-43.4%) for nonusers and 58.3% (95% CI, 36.6%-77.9%) for users compared with 32.0% (95% CI, 25.3%-39.4%) for nonusers (P = .001 and P = .01, respectively). Specificities were 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%-90.1%) for users compared with 89.2% (95% CI, 87.6%-90.7%) for nonusers and 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%-90.1%) for users compared with 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%-92.4%) for nonusers (P = .13 and P = .01, respectively). The areas under the ROC curve were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68-0.90) for users compared with 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.71) for nonusers and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.62-0.85) for users compared with 0.65 (95% CI, 0.61-0.69) for nonusers (P = .05 and P = .17, respectively). Among men, who composed the majority of low-dose aspirin users, the areas under the ROC curve were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76-0.98) for users compared with 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.74) for nonusers and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.68-0.93) for users compared with 0.67 (95% CI, 0.61-0.72) for nonusers (P = .003 and P = .04, respectively). CONCLUSION: For 2 iFOBTs, use of low-dose aspirin compared with no aspirin was associated with a markedly higher sensitivity for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms, with only a slightly lower specificity.",cancer
"Pediatric anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as generalized lymphadenopathy. Because a finding of generalized lymphadenopathy can be associated with such a wide range of diseases and conditions, determining its cause can sometimes be challenging. Infectious causes are the most common; however, it is important also to consider other entities in the workup. Here we present the case of a 3-year-old girl with generalized lymphadenopathy and fever, in whom the cause of the symptoms was initially thought to be infectious. Ultimately, however, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was diagnosed. Using this case as a backdrop, we discuss the wide range of systemic illnesses that the differential diagnosis of generalized lymphadenopathy encompasses--including infectious, autoimmune, and oncological disorders. We discuss the different findings typically seen in the various entities that figure prominently in the differential, and we outline investigations that can help narrow it. Finally, we present an overview of ALCL, one of the more rare pediatric malignancies.",cancer
"Head and neck cancer: changing epidemiology and public health implications. Characterizing the epidemiology of head and neck cancers is challenging and has received limited attention in the medical literature. Traditionally, 80%-90% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) have been attributed to tobacco and alcohol use, but with growing public awareness and tobacco control efforts over the past few decades, there has been a downward trend in smoking prevalence in the US. There is also emerging evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for inconsistencies in HNSCC trends, with oncogenic HPV DNA found in approximately half of oropharyngeal cancers and in a high proportion of oropharyngeal cancers in nonsmokers and nondrinkers. The risk to HNSCC epidemiology is that whatever gains continue to be made in tobacco control may become lost in the increasing numbers of oropharyngeal cancers due to HPV. The purpose of this review is to explore the changing epidemiology of HNSCC, focusing on how it has been shaped by health policy and advocacy interventions and how it will continue to have public health implications in the future, particularly in considering preventive strategies against HPV. Given that the majority of HNSCCs are the result of exposure to preventable public health risks, more focus should be given to this area.",cancer
"Systemic approaches for multifocal bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: is there an appropriate target? Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a subset of pulmonary adenocarcinoma characterized by distinct and unique pathological, molecular, radiographic, and clinical features. While the incidence of pure BAC is rare, comprising only 1% to 4% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mixed subtypes (including BAC with focal invasion and adenocarcinoma with BAC features) represent as much as 20% of adenocarcinomas--and that figure may be increasing. Despite the longstanding recognition of this entity, there is no established treatment paradigm for patients with multifocal BAC, resulting in competing approaches and treatment controversies. Current options for multifocal BAC include both surgery and systemic therapies. Unfortunately, prospective data on systemic approaches are limited by study design and small patient numbers; there are only seven phase II studies involving four therapies. This article evaluates key characteristics of BAC, including the current understanding of histopathology and tumor biology. In addition, it comprehensively reviews the systemic phase II studies in an attempt to clarify the therapeutic challenges in this disease. It also includes the first proposed treatment paradigm that integrates both EGFR mutational status and the sub-histologies, mucinous and nonmucinous BAC.",cancer

"A short account of cancer--specifically in relation to squamous cell carcinoma. Cancer is the outcome of a complex multifactorial process of cytogenetic and epigenetic changes that affect cell cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA repair mechanisms and cell differentiation. Cancer cells have the capacity to evade the immune system, to invade tissues and to metastasize. Cancer is treated by surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, each as single treatment modalities or more often in combination. Failure of treatment to cure a patient of cancer may be owing to the fact that radiotherapy and chemotherapy can eradicate transit-amplifying cells which are characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and prolonged survival; but cannot eradicate all cancer stem cells that divide slowly, have a relatively unlimited self-renewal capacity and express anti-apoptotic genes; and also owing to the fact that surgery cannot always eliminate occult fields of pre-cancerization.",cancer

"Effect of mitoxantrone on outcome of children with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL R3): an open-label randomised trial. BACKGROUND: Although survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has improved greatly in the past two decades, the outcome of those who relapse has remained static. We investigated the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who relapsed on present therapeutic regimens. METHODS: This open-label randomised trial was undertaken in 22 centres in the UK and Ireland and nine in Australia and New Zealand. Patients aged 1-18 years with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were stratified into high-risk, intermediate-risk, and standard-risk groups on the basis of duration of first complete remission, site of relapse, and immunophenotype. All patients were allocated to receive either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in induction by stratified concealed randomisation. Neither patients nor those giving interventions were masked. After three blocks of therapy, all high-risk group patients and those from the intermediate group with postinduction high minimal residual disease (>/=10(-4) cells) received an allogenic stem-cell transplant. Standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with postinduction low minimal residual disease (<10(-4) cells) continued chemotherapy. The primary outcome was progression-free survival and the method of analysis was intention-to-treat. Randomisation was stopped in December, 2007 because of differences in progression-free and overall survival between the two groups. This trial is registered, reference number ISCRTN45724312. FINDINGS: Of 239 registered patients, 216 were randomly assigned to either idarubicin (109 analysed) or mitoxantrone (103 analysed). Estimated 3-year progression-free survival was 35.9% (95% CI 25.9-45.9) in the idarubicin group versus 64.6% (54.2-73.2) in the mitoxantrone group (p=0.0004), and 3-year overall survival was 45.2% (34.5-55.3) versus 69.0% (58.5-77.3; p=0.004). Differences in progression-free survival between groups were mainly related to a decrease in disease events (progression, second relapse, disease-related deaths; HR 0.56, 0.34-0.92, p=0.007) rather than an increase in adverse treatment effects (treatment death, second malignancy; HR 0.52, 0.24-1.11, p=0.11). INTERPRETATION: As compared with idarubicin, mitoxantrone conferred a significant benefit in progression-free and overall survival in children with relapsed acute lymphobastic leukaemia, a potentially useful clinical finding that warrants further investigation.

"First-line treatment with zoledronic acid as compared with clodronic acid in multiple myeloma (MRC Myeloma IX): a randomised controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of skeletal events in patients with malignant bone disease, and zoledronic acid has shown potential anticancer effects in preclinical and clinical studies. We aimed to establish whether bisphosphonates can affect clinical outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma. METHODS: Patients of age 18 years or older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were enrolled from 120 centres in the UK. Computer-generated randomisation sequence was used to allocate patients equally, via an automated telephone service, to receive 4 mg zoledronic acid as an infusion every 3-4 weeks or 1600 mg oral clodronic acid daily. Patients also received intensive or non-intensive induction chemotherapy. No investigators, staff, or patients were masked to treatment allocation, and bisphosphonate and maintenance therapy continued at least until disease progression. The primary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate. We assessed between-group differences with Cox proportional hazards models for progression-free survival and overall survival, and with logistic regression models for overall response rate. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN68454111. FINDINGS: 1970 patients were enrolled between May, 2003, and November, 2007, of whom 1960 were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis: 981 in the zoledronic acid group (555 on intensive chemotherapy, 426 on non-intensive chemotherapy); and 979 on clodronic acid (556 on intensive chemotherapy, 423 on non-intensive chemotherapy). The treatment cutoff was Oct 5, 2009, with patients receiving bisphosphonates for a median of 350 days (IQR 137-632) before disease progression, with a median of 3.7 years' follow-up (IQR 2.9-4.7). Zoledronic acid reduced mortality by 16% (95% CI 4-26) versus clodronic acid (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96; p=0.0118), and extended median overall survival by 5.5 months (50.0 months, IQR 21.0 to not reached vs 44.5 months, IQR 16.5 to not reached; p=0.04). Zoledronic acid also significantly improved progression-free survival by 12% (95% CI 2-20) versus clodronic acid (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; p=0.0179), and increased median progression-free survival by 2.0 months (19.5 months, IQR 9.0-38.0 vs 17.5 months, IQR 8.5-34.0; p=0.07). Rates of complete, very good partial, or partial response did not differ significantly between the zoledronic acid and clodronic acid groups for patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy (432 patients [78%] vs 422 [76%]; p=0.43) or non-intensive induction chemotherapy (215 [50%] vs 195 [46%]; p=0.18). Both bisphosphonates were generally well tolerated, with similar occurrence of acute renal failure and treatment-emergent serious adverse events, but zoledronic acid was associated with higher rates of confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw (35 [4%]) than was clodronic acid (3 [<1%]). INTERPRETATION: Consistent with the potential anticancer activity of zoledronic acid, overall survival improved independently of prevention of skeletal-related events, showing that zoledronic acid has treatment benefits beyond bone health. These findings support immediate treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, not only for prevention of skeletal-related events, but also for potential antimyeloma benefits.

"Complete remission and early death after intensive chemotherapy in patients aged 60 years or older with acute myeloid leukaemia: a web-based application for prediction of outcomes. BACKGROUND: About 50% of patients (age >/=60 years) who have acute myeloid leukaemia and are otherwise medically healthy (ie, able to undergo intensive chemotherapy) achieve a complete remission (CR) after intensive chemotherapy, but with a substantially increased risk of early death (ED) compared with younger patients. We verified the association of standard clinical and laboratory variables with CR and ED and developed a web-based application for risk assessment of intensive chemotherapy in these patients. METHODS: Multivariate regression analysis was used to develop risk scores with or without knowledge of the cytogenetic and molecular risk profiles for a cohort of 1406 patients (aged >/=60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, who were treated with two courses of intensive induction chemotherapy (tioguanine, standard-dose cytarabine, and daunorubicin followed by high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone; or with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in the first and second induction courses) in the German Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Cooperative Group 1999 study. Risk prediction was validated in an independent cohort of 801 patients (aged >60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia who were given two courses of cytarabine and daunorubicin in the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia 1996 study. FINDINGS: Body temperature, age, de-novo leukaemia versus leukaemia secondary to cytotoxic treatment or an antecedent haematological disease, haemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen, and serum concentration of lactate dehydrogenase were significantly associated with CR or ED. The probability of CR with knowledge of cytogenetic and molecular risk (score 1) was from 12% to 91%, and without knowledge (score 2) from 21% to 80%. The predicted risk of ED was from 6% to 69% for score 1 and from 7% to 63% for score 2. The predictive power of the risk scores was confirmed in the independent patient cohort (CR score 1, from 10% to 91%; CR score 2, from 16% to 80%; ED score 1, from 6% to 69%; and ED score 2, from 7% to 61%). INTERPRETATION: The scores for acute myeloid leukaemia can be used to predict the probability of CR and the risk of ED in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, for whom intensive induction chemotherapy is planned. This information can help physicians with difficult decisions for treatment of these patients. FUNDING: Deutsche Krebshilfe and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.",cancer
"Autophagy and metabolism. Autophagy is a process of self-cannibalization. Cells capture their own cytoplasm and organelles and consume them in lysosomes. The resulting breakdown products are inputs to cellular metabolism, through which they are used to generate energy and to build new proteins and membranes. Autophagy preserves the health of cells and tissues by replacing outdated and damaged cellular components with fresh ones. In starvation, it provides an internal source of nutrients for energy generation and, thus, survival. A powerful promoter of metabolic homeostasis at both the cellular and whole-animal level, autophagy prevents degenerative diseases. It does have a downside, however--cancer cells exploit it to survive in nutrient-poor tumors.",cancer
"The control of the metabolic switch in cancers by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Cells from some tumors use an altered metabolic pattern compared with that of normal differentiated adult cells in the body. Tumor cells take up much more glucose and mainly process it through aerobic glycolysis, producing large quantities of secreted lactate with a lower use of oxidative phosphorylation that would generate more adenosine triphosphate (ATP), water, and carbon dioxide. This is the Warburg effect, which provides substrates for cell growth and division and free energy (ATP) from enhanced glucose use. This metabolic switch places the emphasis on producing intermediates for cell growth and division, and it is regulated by both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in a number of key cancer-producing pathways. Blocking these metabolic pathways or restoring these altered pathways could lead to a new approach in cancer treatments.",cancer
"On getting there from here. Studies on a variety of interesting biological problems, ranging from circadian rhythm to cancer cell growth to longevity, have begun to give evidence that the physiological state of cells and tissues reflects both the cell's regulatory systems and its state of intermediary metabolism. It is appreciated that the regulatory state of a cell or tissue, as driven by transcription factors and signaling pathways, can impose itself upon the dynamics of metabolic state. It follows that the reciprocal must also be the case, that metabolic state will feed back to impose itself on regulatory state. An appreciation and understanding of this reciprocity may be required to crack open problems in biological research that have heretofore been insoluble.",cancer
Late effects of cancer and cancer therapy on oral health and quality of life. Persisting and chronic oral complications of cancer therapy are common.

"The anterior extraperitoneal approach to the rare presacral/ retroperitoneal schwannoma. Presacral/retroperitoneal schwannomas are extremely unusual and their surgical approach is challenging. Various surgical approaches have been proposed. Here we describe our experience with the anterior extraperitoneal approach for the Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. A 33-year-old woman presented with a history of infertility and a presacral/retroperitoneal mass. The patient underwent abdominal/pelvic CT and MRI that demonstrated presence of a solid, well circumscribed Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. The anterior extraperitoneal approach was successfully used to remove the presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. The histopathological evaluation confirmed the preoperative diagnosis. The anterior extraperitoneal approach is helpful as an alternative approach in the surgical management of benign Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannomas (Fig. 4, Ref. 15).",cancer
"Recurrent multiple cardiac myxomas. BACKGROUND: The recurrence of cardiac myxoma after a surgical excision is a rare condition. The mechanism responsible for the recurrence remains unclear. Multifocal growth of a benign myxoma or malignant transformation, inadequate resection, intraoperative implantation or embolization, familial disposition, and the abnormal DNA ploidy pattern play an important role in development of recurrent myxoma. CASE: We report the case of a 24-year-old female with recurrent multiple cardiac myxomas. She had an abortus 2 months ago. The patient had undergone a resection of left atrial and right ventricular myxoma with extension to the right pulmonary artery 8 years ago. The preoperative echocardiographic examinations revealed recurrent left atrial and right and left ventricular myxomas. The patient underwent a redo-surgery and, in addition to a large myxoma in the right ventricle with involvement of the tricuspid valve and anterior papillary muscle, three myxomas including both myxomas originating at the top and the base of the posterior papillary muscle, respectively, the other myxoma between both papillary muscles in the posterior wall of the left ventricle, and 2 more small myxomas including 1 in the interatrial septum and the other on atrial surface of anterior mitral annulus were found in the left ventricle and atrium. The myxomas were successfully excised through a transmitral approach with a combined bi-atrial incision. The tricuspid valve and mitral valve were repaired with annuloplasty. She had an uneventful postoperative course and no residual myxoma was found by echocardiography. CONCLUSION: We think that a long-term follow-up by echocardiography in all patients after the resection of myxoma is advised for an early detection of any recurrence (Fig. 5, Ref. 9).",cancer
"Ileus, pregnancy or leiomyoma? A case of a large intraabdominal tumor. OBJECTIVE: Authors evaluate a case of an extremely large leiomyoma, its symptomatology, diagnosis and surgical treatment. They present the possible peroperative complications and emphasize the necessity of the interdisciplinary approach. METHODS: The set of patients consists of 21 patients with leiomyomas of various localizations. All patients were operated by means of conventional operation. The material was sent for classical bioptic examination with the use of immuno-histochemical analysis. RESULTS: Unlike found in literature, the most common appearance of leiomyoma in our set of patients was on small bowel, namely 10 of 21 patients had tumors in this localization. Furthermore there were three tumors of gynecological origin. Two of them had acute abdominal disease (AAD) while in these cases, ileus was a reason for urgent operations. In all three gynecological cases it was difficult to diagnose preoperatively the origin of tumors. In one patient, the preparation led to partial iatrogenic lesion of left ureter which was subsequently treated with primary suture. The authors describe zero mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively simple diagnosis of leiomyomas, in some cases of extreme size of the tumor combined with its localization in the small pelvis makes it difficult to distinguish it from other mesenchymal tumors. In order eliminate the peroperative complications it is possible to introduce a urethral catheter and to set up a multidisciplinary operation team to achieve combined experience (Fig. 5, Ref. 14).",cancer
"Adjuvant docetaxel for high-risk, node-negative breast cancer. BACKGROUND: A regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) is superior to a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) when used as adjuvant therapy in women with node-positive breast cancer. The value of taxanes in the treatment of node-negative disease has not been determined. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1060 women with axillary-node-negative breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor for recurrence (according to the 1998 St. Gallen criteria) to treatment with TAC or FAC every 3 weeks for six cycles after surgery. The primary end point was disease-free survival after at least 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 77 months, the proportion of patients alive and disease-free was higher among the 539 women in the TAC group (87.8%) than among the 521 women in the FAC group (81.8%), representing a 32% reduction in the risk of recurrence with TAC (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.93; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). This benefit was consistent, regardless of hormone-receptor status, menopausal status, or number of high-risk factors. The difference in survival rates (TAC, 95.2%; FAC, 93.5%) was not significant (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.26); however, the number of events was small (TAC, 26; FAC, 34). Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 28.2% with TAC and 17.0% with FAC (P<0.001). Toxicity associated with TAC was diminished when primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was provided. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with adjuvant FAC, adjuvant TAC improved the rate of disease-free survival among women with high-risk, node-negative breast cancer.

"Using activated carbon nanoparticles to decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity of anticancer therapeutic agents. One of the key obstacles against the success in cancer chemotherapy is the toxic and side effects of the chemotherapeutic agents. The avoidance of these toxic and side effects will greatly improve the therapeutic effects of anticancer drugs while decrease the pains of the patients. Here we show that activated carbon nanoparticles (ACNP), one of the mesoporous nanoparticles, can decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity of mitomycin C (MMC). To study the effects of ACNP on genotoxicity and teratogenicity of MMC, methods of PCE micronucleus test, Chinese hamster lung cell chromosome aberration experiment and rat teratogenicity were employed to observe the differences in genotoxicity and teratogenicity between ACNP-adsorbed MMC (ACNP-MMC) and free MMC. Results demonstrated that free MMC 0.16-5.0 microg/kg significantly increased the positive rate of PCE micronucleus test, the chromosome aberration rate and rat teratogenecity, but ACNP-MMC did not increased these heredity and reproduction toxicological indexes in a dose range of 0.625-10.0 microg/kg. From these results, it can be concluded that ACNP-MMC have significant effects to decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity effects of MMC. These results will have a considerable impact on the strategy of anticancer chemotherapy.",cancer
"In vitro cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on human glioma cells. With rapid development of nanotechnology, concerns about the possible adverse health effects on human beings by using nanomaterials have been raised. Transparent yellow iron oxide (alpha-FeOOH) nanoparticles have been widely used in paints, plastic, rubber, building materials, papermaking, food products and pharmaceutical industry, thus the potential health implications by the exposure should be considered. The purpose of this study is to assess the cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on U251 human glioma cells. The alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles are in clubbed shapes with 9 nm in diameter and 43 nm long. The specific surface area is 115.3 m2/g. After physicochemical characterization of the nanoparticles, U251 cells were exposed to a-FeOOH at the doses of 0, 3.75, 15, 60 and 120 microg/mL. The results showed that the alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles reduced the cell viability and induced necrosis and apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, nanoparticle exposure significantly increased the levels of superoxide anion and nitric oxide in a dose-dependent fashion in the cells. Our results suggest that exposure to alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles induce significant free radical formation and cytotoxic effects. The large surface area that induced high surface reactivity may play an important role in the cytotoxic effect of alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles.",cancer
"Preferential killing of cancer cells using silicon carbide quantum dots. Silicon carbide quantum dots are highly luminescent biocompatible nanoparticles whose properties might be of particular interest for biomedical applications. In this study we investigated Silicon Carbide Quantum Dots (3C-SiC QDs) cellular localisation and influence on viability and proliferation on oral squamous carcinoma (AT-84 and HSC) and immortalized cell lines (S-G). They clearly localize into the nuclei, but the presence of 3C-SiC QDs in culture medium provoke morphological changes in cultured cells. We demonstrate that 3C-SiC QDs display dose- and time-dependent selective cytotoxicity on cancer versus immortalized cells in vitro. Since one of the limitations of classical antineoplastic drugs is their lack of selectivity, these results open a new way in the search for antiproliferative drugs.",cancer
"Process for determining the cancer burden of the Hopi Tribe. The Hopi Tribe is located in the northeastern part of Arizona on more than one million acres of federally reserved land. Tribally based community research, conducted in collaboration with University of Arizona researchers, has been successfully implemented on Hopi beginning with a cross-sectional community survey in 1993 and continuing with a second survey in 2006. Both surveys identified a strong community interest in cancer. This article reports on the process involved in a third study, in which official Hopi enrollment data were matched with Arizona Cancer Registry data. The process involved bringing in a new partner and obtaining tribal, state, and university approvals, as well as a signed data exchange agreement between the state and the Hopi Tribe. Technical implementation of the data match required computer programming and epidemiologic expertise, as well as an understanding of the community and the culture. Close collaboration among Hopi residents and university epidemiologists was critical.",cancer
"Mediastinal teratoma mimicking massive pleural effusion. Immature mediastinal teratoma is very rare, found in only 1% of all mediastinal teratomas. Raised serum alpha feto-protein acts as important surrogate marker for both diagnosis and follow up in such cases. Surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy are keys in the management, especially in patients older than 15 years of age. We present a 14-year-boy presenting clinico-radiologically as left sided massive pleural effusion. Raised serum marker as well as excision biopsy of the mediastinal mass following thoracotomy were indicative of a diagnosis of immature teratoma.",cancer
"Calcium and magnesium in drinking water and risk of death from kidney cancer. The possible association between the risk of kidney cancer development and the levels of calcium and magnesium in drinking water from municipal supplies was investigated in a matched cancer case-control study in Taiwan. All eligible kidney cancer deaths (1778 cases) of Taiwan residents from 1999 through 2008 were compared with deaths from other causes (1778 controls), and the levels of calcium and magnesium in drinking water of these residents were determined. Data on calcium and magnesium levels in drinking water throughout Taiwan were obtained from the Taiwan Water Supply Corporation (TWSC). The control group consisted of individuals who died from other causes, and the controls were pair-matched to the cancer cases by gender, year of birth, and year of death. The adjusted odd ratios for death attributed to kidney cancer for individuals with higher calcium levels in their drinking water, as compared to the lowest tertile, were 0.89 (95% CI = 0.72-1.11) and 0.78 (95% CI = 0.62-0.98), respectively. The adjusted odd ratios were not statistically significant for the relationship between magnesium levels in drinking water and kidney cancer development. The results of the present study demonstrate that there may be a significant protective effect of calcium intake from drinking water against the risk of death due to kidney cancer.",cancer
"The use of osteo-articular allografts for reconstruction after resection of the distal radius for tumour. Several techniques have been described to reconstruct a mobile wrist joint after resection of the distal radius for tumour. We reviewed our experience of using an osteo-articular allograft to do this in 17 patients with a mean follow-up of 58.9 months (28 to 119). The mean range of movement at the wrist was 56 degrees flexion, 58 degrees extension, 84 degrees supination and 80 degrees pronation. The mean ISOLS-MSTS score was 86% (63% to 97%) and the mean patient-rated wrist evaluation score was 16.5 (3 to 34). There was no local recurrence or distant metastases. The procedure failed in one patient with a fracture of the graft and an arthrodesis was finally required. Union was achieved at the host-graft interface in all except two cases. No patient reported more than modest non-disabling pain and six reported no pain at all. Radiographs showed early degenerative changes at the radiocarpal joint in every patient. A functional pain-free wrist can be restored with an osteo-articular allograft after resection of the distal radius for bone tumour, thereby avoiding the donor site morbidity associated with an autograft. These results may deteriorate with time.",cancer
"Use of metal proximal radial endoprostheses for treatment of non-traumatic disorders: a case series.

The patients had a mean age of 33.4 years (20 to 60) at the time of surgery and the mean follow-up was 7.6 years (0.8 to 16). Following surgery, all elbows were clinically stable and there was 100% survivorship of the prosthesis. Evaluation of function was assessed clinically and by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, achieving a mean of 86% (70 to 100). Results at medium-term follow-up are encouraging with regards to elbow stability, implant survivorship and functional outcome.",cancer
"Baseline characteristics of participants in the randomized national lung screening trial. BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a randomized study conducted at 33 US sites, is comparing lung cancer mortality among persons screened with reduced dose helical computerized tomography and among persons screened with chest radiograph. In this article, we present characteristics of the study population. METHODS: Eligible participants were aged 55-74 years and were current or former smokers with a cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack-years. Randomization was stratified by site, sex, and age. To assess representativeness of the study population, demographic characteristics of individuals from the general population who met NLST age and smoking history inclusion criteria were obtained from the Tobacco Use Supplement of the US Census Bureau Current Population Surveys. RESULTS: The NLST enrolled 53 456 persons, with 26 733 randomly assigned to chest radiograph screening and 26 723 to computerized tomography screening. Characteristics of the participants were as follows: 31 533 (59%) were men, 39 234 (73%) were younger than 65 years, 25 779 (48%) were current smokers, and 16 839 (32%) had a college or higher degree. Median cigarette exposure was 48 pack-years. Among Tobacco Use Supplement respondents who met NLST age and smoking history criteria, 59% were men, 65% were younger than 65 years, and 57% were current smokers. Median cigarette exposure among this group was 47 pack-years, and 14% had a college degree or higher. CONCLUSION: The NLST cohort has a distribution of sex and pack-year history that is similar to the component of the general US population that meets the major NLST eligibility criteria; however, NLST participants are younger, better educated, and less likely to be current smokers.",cancer
"Multiple myeloma precursor disease. Recent data indicate that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by the precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma. Currently, multiple myeloma is a clinical diagnosis based on manifestations including hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions, whereas MGUS and smoldering myeloma are diagnosed based on laboratory abnormalities. Current clinical markers allow for more individualized risk stratification and counseling of these patients. However, there is a dearth of biomarkers and molecular imaging techniques capable of (1) accurately identifying patients with disease biology corresponding with high risk of progression; (2) elucidating the mechanism of transformation to multiple myeloma; and (3) forming a framework for development of targeted therapies. This case presentation and review discusses the current understanding of myeloma precursor disease and future opportunities for improving personalized management of patients with MGUS or smoldering myeloma, as well as the potential for developing early treatment strategies designed to delay and prevent development of multiple myeloma.",cancer
"Active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer: a decision analysis. CONTEXT: In the United States, 192,000 men were diagnosed as having prostate cancer in 2009, the majority with low-risk, clinically localized disease. Treatment of these cancers is associated with substantial morbidity. Active surveillance is an alternative to initial treatment, but long-term outcomes and effect on quality of life have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To examine the quality-of-life benefits and risks of active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: Decision analysis using a simulation model was performed: men were treated at diagnosis with brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or radical prostatectomy or followed up by active surveillance (a strategy of close monitoring of newly diagnosed patients with serial prostate-specific antigen measurements, digital rectal examinations, and biopsies, with treatment at disease progression or patient choice). Probabilities and utilities were derived from previous studies and literature review. In the base case, the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was assumed to be 0.83. Men incurred short- and long-term adverse effects of treatment. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohorts of 65-year-old men newly diagnosed as having clinically localized, low-risk prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen level <10 ng/mL, stage </=T2a disease, and Gleason score </=6). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). RESULTS: Active surveillance was associated with the greatest QALE (11.07 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), followed by brachytherapy (10.57 QALYs), IMRT (10.51 QALYs), and radical prostatectomy (10.23 QALYs). Active surveillance remained associated with the highest QALE even if the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was as low as 0.6. However, the QALE gains and the optimal strategy were highly dependent on individual preferences for living under active surveillance and for having been treated. CONCLUSIONS: Under a wide range of assumptions, for a 65-year-old man, active surveillance is a reasonable approach to low-risk prostate cancer based on QALE compared with initial treatment. However, individual preferences play a central role in the decision whether to treat or to pursue active surveillance.",cancer
"Ovarian small cell carcinoma, hypercalcemic type exhibiting a response to high-dose chemotherapy. A gravida 2, para 2 25-year-old woman three months post-partum presented to her primary physician with abdominal pain and bloating; a 20-cm complex cystic pelvic mass was identified by ultrasound. No ovarian masses were noted during ultrasound exam at the prior pregnancy, less than one year earlier. Her labs included hypercalcemia (11.8 mg/dL, normal less than 10.5) and an elevated CA 125 (160 U/mL, normal less than 35). An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 20-cm right ovarian mass. Frozen section was performed and a sex cord-stromal tumor was favored. Permanent sections of the specimen, however, revealed round, closely packed neoplastic cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasm ratio and high mitotic rate growing in a diffuse pattern with scattered follicle-like, ill-defined microcystic spaces. Immunohistochemical stains revealed the neoplasm to be focally positive for keratin and negative for inhibin. The final diagnosis rendered was small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type. Further staging revealed para-aortic lymph node involvement (stage IIIC). Current literature suggests a very poor prognosis for these neoplasms despite aggressive therapy, with an overall survival rate of 10 percent. Rare response has been noted, however, with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Our patient underwent a rigorous chemotherapeutic regimen followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant, and as of August 2010, (17 months after initial diagnosis), the patient has had no recurrence.",cancer
"Differences in attributions of mental illness and social distance for portrayals of four mental disorders. For individuals with mental illness, others' perceptions of mental illness often limit integration into communities. Perceptions of mental illness manifest as social stigma in the form of social distance and may depend on individuals' attributions of the origins of mental illness. 180 university students completed a survey on attribution of mental illness and social distance across several disorders (psychiatric and physical). Participants indicated greater social distance for severe mental illness (i.e., schizophrenia) than less severe mental illness and physical illness. More desire for social distance may be related to unfamiliarity with severe mental illness rather than less severe mental and physical illnesses. Greater understanding of how individuals perceive mental illness can inform efforts to educate the public.",cancer

Granulomatous mycosis fungoides with large cell transformation misdiagnosed as leprosy. BACKGROUND: Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is an unusual histopathological variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma without clinical distinction from classic mycosis fungoides. Symptoms associated with peripheral nerve involvement have rarely been reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: The authors described a case of granulomatous MF stage IIB with large cell transformation who initially presented with leprosy-like condition and chronic left peroneal neuropathy The patient received six courses ofgemcitabine with greater than 90% improvement of skin lesions. The rest of the lesions were successfully treated with local electron beam radiation. CONCLUSION: Granulomatous MF with neuropathy can be clinically misdiagnosed if there is no histopathological and immunohistochemical finding to support the diagnosis of lymphoma.,cancer
"Double check up of malignancy biopsy specimens for patient safety. BACKGROUND: The diagnostic of malignancy in biopsy specimens is very important because it guides to selected treatment option and prognostic prediction. However biopsy specimens usually have small pieces leading to variations of the interpretation by anatomical pathologists. OBJECTIVE: To detect and correct the errors or the significant discrepancies in the diagnosis of biopsy specimens before sign-out and to determine the frequency of anatomic pathology significant discrepancies. DESIGN: The application of the mutually agreed work instructions (record) for the detection of errors or the significant discrepancies and their process of sign-out. The record of biopsy specimen that received a secondary check (1959 cases, 2005-2007) was analyzed. RESULTS: After a secondary check, 53 cases of non-malignancy for any reason by a second pathologist were included. However when using our definition on significant discrepancies, only 37 cases were considered. Another seven cases with the opinions with malignancy that were of different cell types that do harm to the patients were added. Therefore, 44 cases (2.25%) had truly significant discrepancies. CONCLUSION: The truly significant discrepancy frequency was 2.25% during the process of pre-sign-out secondary check of malignancy of biopsy specimens. The project has been applied as a routine daily work. It can be an innovative safety program for patient in Thailand.",cancer
"Results of multidisciplinary therapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa at Srinagarind Hospital, Thailand. OBJECTIVE: Review the clinical presentation and treatment of buccal carcinoma and compare it to the results of treatment as per survival rate. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors reviewed the medical records of newly diagnosed seen between 1995 and 2005 at the Division of Plastic Surgery and the Department of Radiotherapy, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University Patients previously treated elsewhere or those whose lesions secondarily involved the buccal mucosa were excluded. RESULTS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 107 buccal carcinoma patients (94 females and 13 males) averaging 67 years of age. The 5-year survival rates of patients with Stage I (5.6%), 11 (6.5%), III (12.1%), and IVa (75.7%) were 67%, 43%, 47%, and 26%, respectively. A combined modality treatment (surgery and radiation or chemotherapy) was used to treat the advanced stage (III and IV) patients. The rate of incomplete therapy was high (47.78%). In the group that completed the protocol (i.e., neoadjuvant, surgery, and post operative radiation), there were five patients for whom the 5-year survival seemed higher than the patients who followed the standard treatment of surgery and post-operative radiation but it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The treatment of buccal carcinoma requires a multidisciplinary team approach because most of the patients are elderly and present with an advanced stage. If treatment continues through to completion of the protocol, the survival rate would increase.",cancer
"Radical esophagectomy for esophageal cancer: results in Thai patients. BACKGROUND: Radical esophagectomy was reported to have prolonged survival in patients with esophageal cancer However, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Controversy still exists regarding value of radical esophagectomy MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors analyzed the results, including complications and survival in 68 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who were treated with transthoracic radical esophagectomy at the Department of Surgery, Siriraj hospital, Mahidol University between June 2002 and June 2008. RESULTS: There were 57 males and eight females with a mean age of 59.28 +/- 11.25 years. Regarding T staging, 81.5% of the patients were in T3 stage while 1.5% of the patients had Ti stage, 15.4% had T2 stage, and 1.5% had T4 stage. Lymph node metastasis (NI) was found in 63.1% of the patients and NO was in 36.9%. Most of the patients were in advanced stages with 53.8% in stage III, 44.6% in stage II, and 1.5% in stage I. The 5-year survival rate of the patients with node positive was significantly lower than the patients with node negative (p = 0.018). The survival was significantly better in stage Ilcompared to stage III (p = 0.012). Overall 5-year survival rate was 28. 5%. Most common complications were from pulmonary causes (22.1%), anastomotic leakage (8.8%), and wound infection (8.8%). Mortality rate was 4.41%. CONCLUSION: Radical esophagectomy was associated with relatively low mortality and acceptable survival. It should be considered in surgical treatment of patients with esophageal cancer",cancer
"Obstructive uropathy following radiation therapy in carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Eighty-three cases of carcinoma of the cervix presenting over a 5-year period, 1997 to 2001 were considered for evaluation of the effects of Irradiation on the urinary tract. Ultrasound scans were used to detect ureteric obstructions in the follow-up period. Significant progressive ureteric obstruction occurred in 6 patients (7.2%), all of whom had malignant strictures. The diagnoses of these strictures were made between 8 months and five years after the Initial treatment. Patients having malignant stricture tend to be in a higher original stage of tumour. The lower ureter was the site of ureteric obstruction in 4 patients while 2 had lesions in middle ureter. The latency period between primary treatment of the tumour and diagnosis of uropathy is significantly shorter for malignant strictures. The site of occurrence of the strictures had no discernible significance but the absence of a bilateral obstruction in spite of all of them being malignant lesions is in disagreement with the published data.",cancer
Co-existing tubercular axillary lymphadenitis with carcinoma breast can falsely over-stage the disease--case series. The synchronous occurrence of tuberculosis and carcinoma in breast is unusual. The simultaneous occurrence of both the diseases can complicate the neoplastic disease. The diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in a patient with cancer assumes importance as it can prevent high mortality in patients with co-existent disease and thereby create problems in treatment decision. Axillary lymph node enlargement in breast cancer patient is not always caused by metastatic tumour of the breast even in the ipsilateral axillary nodes. We present here six case reports as an example of tuberculous axillary lymphadenitis co-existing with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Accurate diagnosis has helped in down-staging carcinoma of the breast and also in identifying curable disease.,cancer
"Alpha-fetoprotein secretion in a craniopharyngioma. Are craniopharyngiomas part of the germ cell tumor family? A 14-months-old girl was admitted to our hospital because of excessive irritability and abnormal eye movements over the last two months. Brain CT and MRI revealed a suprasellar cystic and partially solid mass with calcifications. The laboratory investigation revealed increased serum levels of AFP. These findings were suggestive for a brain germ cell tumor. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy was started. After two courses there was a reduction in the levels of AFP but the tumor size remained unchanged. Subtotal tumor excision was performed that revealed the presence of a craniopharyngioma. One month later there was enlargement of the cystic part of the tumor, while serum AFP was elevated. The child received again systemic chemotherapy and placement of a reservoir into the cystic part of the tumor. Analysis of the intracystic flouid revealed the presence of beta-HCG and AFP. Following that the patient received brachytherapy with intracavity yttrium placement. Three months later repeated MRI showed a decrease in the size of the cystic part, while the solid part remained unchanged. Thus, the solid part was treated by radiosurgery. One year later the patient was stable but with complete loss of vision. These observations support the theory of a germ cell tumor family, in which craniopharyngioma and germ cell tumor present the two sides of the same entity, while between them a wide variety of tumors, with variable type of secretion of AFP and/or beta-HCG, may exist.",cancer
"Comparison of BD Surepath and ThinPrep Pap systems in the processing of mucus-rich specimens. BACKGROUND: Excessive mucus, as well as blood and inflammation, can be problematic in the processing and screening of liquid-based cervical Pap preparations by interfering in the process of cell retrieval onto specimen filters or slides. This study compares the capacity of the BD SurePath and ThinPrep liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) tests to handle mucus-laden specimens. METHODS: A 100 muL volume of pooled cervical epithelial cells was added to BD SurePath and ThinPrep liquid Pap test vials. Aliquots of cervical mucus that had been collected and pooled from previously processed mucus-rich Pap specimens were added to each series of test vials in amounts of 250 muL, 500 muL, 1000 muL, and 2000 muL. The vials were then routinely processed on their respective instruments and the test slides evaluated for cellularity of the squamous cell component. RESULTS: The BD SurePath test specimens showed no reduction of the squamous cell component resulting from the addition of any of the aliquots of mucus. The ThinPrep test specimens showed a marked loss of cellularity upon the addition of the first aliquot of mucus, with large areas of the filters showing nearly complete absence of squamous cells. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive mucus remains a potentially limiting factor in the ThinPrep Pap system. This appears to be the result of direct obstruction of the filtration membrane causing a markedly diminished retrieval of squamous epithelial cells and potentially impacting disease detection. The BD SurePath system, conversely, manages mucus by a cell enrichment process, which results in undiminished cell recovery as observed in this study's test conditions.",cancer
"Antitumor effects and anticancer applications of bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are firmly entrenched in the treatment of metastatic bone disease secondary to several tumor types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and myeloma. More recently, an emerging body of preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that bisphosphonates might also exhibit antitumor activity. This expanded role for bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting might have profound clinical implications in many cancer types, particularly in the context of prevention of bone metastasis. Increased understanding of the mechanistic basis of the antitumor effects indicates that these might occur via direct mechanisms such as induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasion, as well as indirect mechanisms such as inhibition of angiogenesis. There is also considerable evidence to suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates might exert additive or synergistic interactions with standard cytotoxic agents. However, mature clinical data with bisphosphonates are limited and, thus far, provide conflicting evidence regarding the antitumor role of bisphosphonates, but have mostly been conducted with first-generation bisphosphonates such as clodronate that are not as effective as next-generation bisphosphonates. Several large randomized clinical trials are ongoing with the next-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid to prospectively confirm an antitumor role for bisphosphonates in various tumor types. This review assesses the current body of preclinical and clinical evidence in favor of an antitumor effect of bisphosphonates in different cancer types.",cancer
"Examining the metastatic niche: targeting the microenvironment. Some of the most common cancer types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, show a predilection to metastasize to bone. The molecular basis of this preferential growth of cancer cells in the bone microenvironment has been an area of active investigation. Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain to be elucidated, it is now increasingly being recognized that the unique characteristics of the bone niche provide homing signals to cancer cells, and create a microenvironment conducive for the cancer cells to colonize. Concomitantly, cancer cells release several regulatory factors that result in abnormal bone destruction and/or formation. This complex bidirectional interplay between tumor cells and bone microenvironment establishes a ""vicious cycle"" that leads to a selective growth advantage for the cancer cells. The molecular insights gained on the underpinnings of bone metastasis in recent years have also provided us with avenues to devise innovative approaches for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this review is to describe our current understanding of molecular pathophysiology of cancer metastases to bone, as well as its therapeutic implications.",cancer
"Implications of bone metastases and the benefits of bone-targeted therapy. Several cancers, including those originating in the breast, prostate, and lung, exhibit a propensity to metastasize to bone, resulting in debilitating skeletal complications. These sequelae, such as intractable pain, pathologic fractures, spinal compression, and hypercalcemia, greatly erode the patients' quality of life. Bisphosphonates, a class of antiresorptive drugs, are now the mainstay of the treatment of skeletal-related events in myeloma bone disease and many solid cancers with bone metastases. Current evidence indicates that newer-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. In addition, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of bone metastasis has resulted in the development of several bone-targeted therapies including a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB ligand (RANKL). In this review, clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of currently available bone-targeted therapies including bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody in the treatment of bone metastasis due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma bone disease will be summarized.",cancer

"Diagnostic dilemmas of infantile sarcoma of the forearm. The authors present an interesting case of a suckling baby treated for forearm tumour. All the preoperative examinations including the imaging methods are documented, as are the surgical procedures and the final results. The case report is interesting not only because such surgery is infrequent but also due to the unpredictable progress of the final diagnosis statement. Before surgery the tumour was diagnosed as an organising haematoma; based on clinical and radiological signs the diagnosis subsequently rose to rapidly growing haemangioma or vascular malformation causing arm paresis and vascular supply disorder. The diagnosis was changed to angiolipoma during surgery. The final histopathological statement was: infantile fibrosarcoma. Despite the virtue of imaging methods and meticulous clinical examination, the surgical and histopathological findings are not necessarily absolutely identical. Having presented this particular case the authors would like to share their experience.",cancer
"Nasal dermoids without intracranial extension in teenagers. BACKGROUND: Nasal dermoid cysts are benign, cystic midline masses. They contain mature tissues and often pocket hair, fat or sebum. Patients usually present with nasal enlargement or with a wide nasal dorsum with or without a fistula, causing an unacceptable cosmetic appearance. OBJECTIVE: To define a reliable surgical approach and method of removing dermoid with no intracranial extension in adolescent age. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively present diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in three teenagers ages 15, 17 and 18. All patients underwent prior surgeries at different hospitals. In the first case, the incision and exstirpation of the fistula's opening, followed by the fistula's canal, was performed. In the other two patients, the nasal dermoids were removed via the open approach with the transcollumelar incision. In all patients, we performed rhinoplasty with osteotomies to achieve an improved cosmetic effect. The esthetic results are presented. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of nasal swelling requires imaging. Total excision of the cyst is considered the casual treatment. The open rhinoplasty is an adequate method in patients with nasal dermoids without an intracranial extension. Experienced surgeons should manage the functional and esthetical aspects together during the same surgery.",cancer
"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) among children with cancer in South Africa. BACKGROUND IN ADULTS,: HIV increases the risk of certain cancers known, or thought, to have an underlying infectious etiology; the impact on the risk of cancer in children is less clear. METHODS: Here, we report results of an on-going study at four pediatric oncology centers in South Africa in which children diagnosed with cancer are tested routinely for HIV. Odds ratios (OR) for the prevalence of various malignancies were calculated (with adjustment for age, sex, and center) for the children infected with HIV using all children with cancer and non-malignant conditions, but not infected with HIV, as a comparison group. RESULTS: Of 882 children with cancer, 38 were HIV infected (for 12 the HIV status was unknown). HIV was associated with Kaposi sarcoma (all 10 cases were HIV infected; P < 0.001) and with Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 46.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.4-130.3; 13/33). For non-Burkitt non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 2/39 were HIV infected (OR = 5.0, 95% CI 0.9-27.0). No other cancer type was significantly associated with HIV, including lymphoid leukemias (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.04-2.9; 1/172). CONCLUSIONS: Only Kaposi sarcoma and Burkitt lymphoma were significantly associated with HIV infection although results for non-Burkitt NHL were suggestive. Notably, we did not identify an association between infection with HIV and lymphoid leukemias, for which an underlying infectious etiology has been suggested.",cancer
"Metastatic tumors in the pancreas in the modern era. BACKGROUND: Tumors metastasizing to the pancreas are rare, and published series are limited by few patients treated for extended periods of time. Renal cell cancer (RCC) is the most common primary tumor metastasizing to the pancreas. Our aim was to describe the clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcomes in a modern series of patients who underwent metastasectomy, with an emphasis on RCC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of all pancreatic resections between January 1993 and October 2009. RESULTS: We identified 40 patients with a median age of 62 years; 55% were female. Patients most commonly presented with abdominal pain (47.5%). Operations performed included 10 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 1 middle, 23 distal, 3 total pancreatectomies, and 3 enucleations. Primary cancers were RCC (n = 20), ovarian (n = 6), sarcoma (n = 3), colon (n = 3), melanoma (n = 2), and others (n = 6). Median survival for all patients after metastasectomy was 4.4 years. Median survival after metastasectomy for RCC was 8.7 years, and the 5-year actuarial survival was 61%. For RCCs, pancreas was the first site of an extrarenal recurrence in 85% and was synchronous with the primary in 5% of patients. There was no survival difference if the time interval to metastasis was shorter than the median (8.7 years), if tumor nodules were multiple or bigger than the median (3 cm), or if the pancreas was not the first site of metastases. CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive approach to lesions metastatic to the pancreas is often warranted if the patient can be rendered free of disease. Although patients with RCC can experience long-term survival after metastasectomy, survival is less favorable for other primary tumors.",cancer
"Therapeutic options in patients with early T stage and advanced N stage of tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas. OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic role of surgery followed by radiotherapy (OPRT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with early T (T1/T2) and advanced N (N2/N3) stage tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING: A tertiary hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 42 patients who met the eligible criteria (24 patients were treated by OPRT, 18 patients by CCRT) were reviewed. RESULTS: Mean overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 49.0 months and 43.0 months in OPRT group, respectively, and 39.6 months and 35.0 months in CCRT group, respectively (P = 0.18 for OS, P = 0.29 for DFS between the two groups). There was also no significant difference in survival estimates between OPRT and CCRT group in terms of two-year OS (P = 0.18) and two-year DFS (P = 0.45). In the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, the scores for global health status and symptom scales did not differ between the two groups. However, the OPRT group reported better functional scales and significantly higher scores for cognitive (P = 0.008) and social function (P = 0.03). Among single items, a significantly lower score for insomnia (P = 0.007) was noted in the OPRT group. In EORTC QLQ-H&N35 modules, there were no significantly different scales between the two groups except scores for nutritional supplements, in which the OPRT group presented lower symptom scores (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: OPRT could be still a viable option for managing selected cases of advanced oropharyngeal cancer because one can expect comparable therapeutic outcome as well as quality of life.",cancer
"Spanish validation of the University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire for head and neck cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: The University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire is one of the most widely used instruments to evaluate the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients. The aim of this study was to perform a Spanish translation and validation of the UW-QOL questionnaire. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Three tertiary-care hospitals and a laryngectomee rehabilitation center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire were performed following accepted international guidelines. The psychometric validation was performed on a consecutive series of patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract with no signs of relapse, recruited from May 2007 to December 2008. Eligible subjects were invited to complete the Spanish version of the UW-QOL questionnaire during routine clinical consultation, and complete it again within 15 days. Subjects also completed a validated Spanish version of the Goldberg Mental Health Survey and were evaluated by the use of the Karnofsky Index. RESULTS: A Spanish version of the questionnaire was developed in iterative fashion. In the psychometric validation process, a total of 76 patients were analyzed. Reliability was excellent, including both internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.84) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient between 0.91 and 0.97 with a confidence interval of 95%). Construct validity was supported by statistically significant relationships between the Karnofsky Index, the Goldberg Mental Health Survey, and the translated UW-QOL questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The Spanish version of the UW-QOL questionnaire appears to be culturally appropriate and psychometrically valid.",cancer
"Correlation of biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters, including choline/creatine ratio (Cho/Cr) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with protein expression of 10 common tumor and prognostic markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: University hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Cho/Cr and ADC obtained from 74 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were correlated with the expression level of the 10 protein markers as determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Cho/Cr showed significant positive correlations with cyclooxygenase 2 in primary tumors (r = 0.714), and epidermal growth factor receptor in metastatic cervical lymph nodes (r = 0.522). ADC showed significant (r = -0.591) negative correlation with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in metastatic cervical lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: There are relationships between protein and functional MRI markers. Future research in this direction may improve our understanding of the cancer micro-environment.",cancer
"Children with acute leukemia: a comparison of outcomes from allogeneic blood stem cell and bone marrow transplantation. BACKGROUND: The relative merits of peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) versus bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for children with standard and high-risk hematologic malignancies remain unclear. In a retrospective study, we compared allogeneic PBSCT (n = 30) with BMT (n = 110) in children with acute leukemia between January 2001 and September 2006. PROCEDURE: Median age for PBSCT was 9 years versus 8 years for BMT. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and medical variables. The unadjusted probabilities of disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The association of graft-source and time to each of the study endpoints was estimated by Cox's regression model and the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was included as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: Time to neutrophil engraftment and platelet independence was faster after PBSCT than BMT (neutrophils 15.0 days vs. 17.0 days, P < 0.001; platelets, 21.0 days vs. 27.0 days, P = 0.034). The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GvHD at 100 days was 10.4% (SE 5.6%) after PBSCT and 15.1% (SE 3.5%) after BMT (P = NS). The cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD was 13.8% (SE 6.3%) after PBSCT and 11.3% (SE 3.1%) after BMT (P = NS). One-year disease-free survival was 37.9% (SE 9.0%) for PBSCT recipients versus 65.1% (SE 4.6%) after BMT (P = 0.005) but this difference was not sustained in multivariate analysis. Thus, only disease risk and pre-transplant CMV seropositivity were significant predictors of disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PBSCT for children produces faster engraftment without increased risk of acute or chronic GvHD.",cancer
"Retrospective analysis of pediatric cancer patients diagnosed with the pandemic H1N1 influenza infection. BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on disease characteristics and outcome of children with cancer who contracted the H1N1 influenza infection during the 2009 pandemic. METHODS: All 76 pediatric patients with cancer and documented H1N1 infection who presented to the Pediatric Department at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) between October 1 and December 1, 2009 were reviewed for clinical characteristics and course of the disease. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients had hematological malignancies and half were receiving non-intensive chemotherapy at the time of infection. With the exception of two patients who needed pediatric intensive care unit admission, the course of the remaining patients was uneventful whether they were hospitalized or not. No deaths related to H1N1 influenza infection were reported. Sixty-three percent of patients became afebrile within 48 hr of receiving oseltamivir. One-third of hospitalized patients were discharged in < 3 days. CONCLUSION: The course of H1N1 influenza infection in children with cancer appears to be mild in most cases.",cancer
"Delay and causes of delay in the diagnosis of childhood cancer in Africa. BACKGROUND: Although a few studies have investigated delays in diagnosis and treatment among children and adolescents with cancer, this has never been subject of study in South Africa. Early diagnosis is fundamental as it allows timely treatment and prevents unnecessary complications. PROCEDURES: Combined prospective and retrospective study of 194 children with cancer at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, diagnosed between 2000 and 2009: 126 patients were included through review of the medical charts and 68 through interviews with the parents. RESULTS: The median total diagnosis delay was 34 days (2-1,826). The median patient delay was 5 days (0-457). The median physician delay was 20 days (0-924). Gender, age or ethnicity of the children, as well as parental level of education did not have a significant influence on the total time to diagnosis. Initial misdiagnoses were frequent (58%). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable delay in diagnosing childhood cancer in the area served by Tygerberg Hospital, due mostly to a physician delay of 20 days on average. The findings of our unit should be correlated with other South African centers. There is a clear need to increase parental awareness of childhood cancer and to intensify the education of nurses and doctors with regard to the warning signs of the disease.",cancer
"Incidence of childhood central nervous system tumors in the Nordic countries. BACKGROUND: The incidence rates of childhood central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. Large geographical and temporal variations in the incidence rates of CNS tumors have been reported. Increasing incidence rates would be a public health concern, as they might indicate increased exposure to environmental risk factors. METHODS: All 3,983 children 0-14 years of age registered with a primary CNS tumor in 1985-2006 in the national cancer registries of the Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden were identified. Tumors were classified according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer version 3 (ICCC-3). Join-point analysis was used to detect changes in trends and to estimate annual changes in incidence rates. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence rate of CNS tumors was 42 per million. No statistically significant change in time trends of incidence rates was observed during 1985-2006. Furthermore, the incidence by birth cohort was relatively stable during the study period. CONCLUSION: The incidence rates of childhood CNS tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. The stable incidence rates during the last 22 years indicate that major changes in environmental risk factors are unlikely.",cancer
"Childhood leukemia incidence in Brazil according to different geographical regions. BACKGROUND: Resource-rich countries tend to have a higher incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas lower rates are seen in more deprived countries. This study describes the incidence of childhood acute leukemia in Brazil, an upper middle-income country, based on data from 16 population-based cancer registries (PBCRs). PROCEDURE: Data were examined from 16 PBCRs in Brazilian cities located in five geographical regions during the period from 1997 to 2004. Incidence rates were analyzed according to gender, age, and type of leukemia. The Wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate for gender-age based difference between by leukemia type. RESULTS: The median age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of leukemia in children aged 0-14 years old was 53.3 per million. A different AAIR was found regarding ALL and myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) that ranged from 24.8 to 76.84 per 1,000,000 children. Manaus, although located in a poor area of Brazil, exhibited the highest AAIR (56.6 per million) of ALL. Goiania had the highest AAIR (24.5 per million) of MPD. The median age-specific incidence rate (ASIR) for the 16 Brazilian PBCRs demonstrated a marked peak in incidence of ALL at age 3 years old, in both genders. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study of childhood leukemia demonstrates that substantial regional differences exist regarding the incidence of acute leukemia in Brazil, which warrants further ecological study.",cancer
"Incidence, survival, and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors versus neuroblastoma in children and young adults: nine standard SEER registries, 1975-2006. BACKGROUND: The incidence, survival, and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in children were determined as a first step in improving diagnosis and therapy. Outcomes were compared with neuroblastoma, a pediatric malignancy that shares several biomarkers. METHODS: Incidence rates, observed survival rates and 31-year limited duration prevalence counts were obtained from SEER*Stat for diagnosis years 1975 to 2006. These rates were compared between and within NETs and neuroblastoma for demographic and tumor-related variables from nine standard SEER registries for ages 0-29 years. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify prognostic factors for survival in NETs. RESULTS: The number of NETs was 1,073 compared to 1,664 neuroblastomas. The most common NET sites were lung, breast, and appendix. NET 5-year observed survival rates increased from 83% between 1975 and 1979 to 84% for the 2000-2006 period, while analogous neuroblastoma survival rates steadily increased from 45-73%. Five-year observed survival was less than 30% in females with NETs of the cervix and ovary. The estimated 31-year limited duration prevalence for NETs as of January 1, 2006 in the U.S. population was 7,724 compared to 9,960 for neuroblastomas. Age-adjusted multivariate Cox Regression demonstrated small cell histology, primary location in the breast, and distant stage as major predictors of decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS: While survivorship has significantly increased for neuroblastoma, those diagnosed with NETs have shown no increase in survival during this 31-year period. NETs constitute an unrecognized cancer threat to children and young adults comparable to neuroblastoma in both number of affected persons and disease severity.",cancer
"A phase II study of metronomic oral topotecan for recurrent childhood brain tumors. BACKGROUND: The prognosis for recurrent or refractory brain tumors in children is poor with conventional therapies. Topotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor with good central nervous system (CNS) penetration following oral administration. Increased efficacy of topotecan has been demonstrated with prolonged low-dose daily treatment in pre-clinical models. To investigate further this drug delivered orally in pediatric CNS malignancies, a phase II study in children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors was performed. PROCEDURE: Patients </= 21 years of age at diagnosis with a recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary CNS malignancy and measurable disease, were eligible. Patients enrolled into four strata: ependymoma (N = 4), high-grade glioma (HGG) (N = 6), brainstem glioma (BSG) (N = 13), and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) (N = 8). Oral topotecan was administered once daily at a dose of 0.8 mg/m(2)/day for 21 consecutive days repeated every 28 days. Response and toxicity profiles were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were evaluable (median age 9.2 years; 10 males). Two objective responses were observed in PNET patients with disseminated tumor at study entry. These two patients remain alive and in remission 7 and 9.5 years off study. Four other patients (two BSG, one PNET, and one HGG) had stable disease (median 4.6 months). The most common toxicities were hematologic. CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral topotecan at a dose of 0.8 mg/m(2)/day can be safely administered to children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors. This regimen identified activity in recurrent PNET. The prolonged progression free survival (PFS) in two PNET patients justifies consideration of this regimen in more advanced clinical trials.",cancer
"Spectrum of SMARCB1/INI1 mutations in familial and sporadic rhabdoid tumors. BACKGROUND: Germline mutations and deletions of SMARCB1/INI1 in chromosome band 22q11.2 predispose patients to rhabdoid tumor and schwannomatosis. Previous estimates suggested that 15-20% of rhabdoid tumors were caused by an underlying germline abnormality of SMARCB1. However, these studies were limited by case selection and an inability to detect intragenic deletions and duplications. PROCEDURE: One hundred matched tumor and blood samples from patients with rhabdoid tumors of the brain, kidney, or soft tissues were analyzed for mutations and deletions of SMARCB1 by FISH, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), sequence analysis and high resolution Illumina 610K SNP-based oligonucleotide array studies. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 100 patients were found to have a germline SMARCB1 abnormality. These abnormalities included point and frameshift mutations, intragenic deletions and duplications, and larger deletions including regions both proximal and distal to SMARCB1. There were nine cases that demonstrated parent to child transmission of a mutated copy of SMARCB1. In eight of the nine cases, one or more family members were also diagnosed with rhabdoid tumor or schwannoma, and two of the eight families presented with multiple affected children in a manner consistent with gonadal mosaicism. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of newly diagnosed patients with rhabdoid tumor have an underlying genetic predisposition to tumors due to a germline SMARCB1 alteration. Families may demonstrate incomplete penetrance and gonadal mosaicism, which must be considered when counseling families of patients with rhabdoid tumor.",cancer
"Masitinib for the treatment of systemic and cutaneous mastocytosis with handicap: a phase 2a study. Treatment options for patients suffering from indolent forms of mastocytosis remain inadequate with the hyperactivation of mast cells responsible for many of the disease's systemic manifestations. Masitinib is a potent and highly selective oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A combined inhibition of c-Kit and Lyn make it particularly efficient in controlling the activity of mast cells and therefore, of potential therapeutic benefit in mastocytosis. Masitinib was administered to 25 patients diagnosed as having systemic or cutaneous mastocytosis with related handicap (i.e., disabilities associated with flushes, depression, pruritus and quality-of-life) at the initial dose levels of 3 or 6 mg/kg/day over 12 weeks. In accordance with the AFIRMM study, response was based upon change of clinical symptoms associated with patient handicap at week 12 relative to baseline, regardless of disease subtype. Improvement was observed in all primary endpoints at week 12 including a reduction of flushes, Hamilton rating, and pruritus as compared with baseline by 64% (P = 0.0005), 43% (P = 0.0049), and 36% (P = 0.0077), respectively. An overall clinical response was observed in 14/25 patients (56%; [95%CI = 37%-75%]), with sustainable improvement observed throughout an extension phase (>60 weeks). Common adverse events were edema (44%), nausea (44%), muscle spasms (28%), and rash (28%), the majority of which were of mild or moderate severity with a significant decline in frequency observed after 12 weeks of treatment. One patient experienced a serious adverse event of reversible agranulocytosis. Masitinib is a promising treatment for indolent forms of mastocytosis with handicap and indicates acceptable tolerability for long-term treatment regimens.",cancer
"A comparison of radiotherapy with radiotherapy plus surgery for brain metastases from urinary bladder cancer: analysis of 62 patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 62 patients received either RT (n = 49), including whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or surgery (OP) combined with WBRT (n = 13). Overall survival (OS), intracerebral control (ICC) and local control (LC) were retrospectively analyzed. Six potential prognostic factors were assessed: age, gender, number of brain metastases, extracerebral metastases, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and interval from tumor diagnosis to RT. RESULTS: Median OS and ICC for the entire cohort were 9 and 7 months. No significant difference between RT and OP + RT was found for OS (p = 0.696) and ICC (p = 0.996). On multivariate analysis, improved OS was associated with lack of extracerebral metastases (p < 0.001) and RPA class (p < 0.001), and ICC with the latter (p < 0.001). SRS-incorporating RT resulted in 1-, 2-, and 3-year LC probability of 78%, 66%, and 51%. No association between LC and any of the potential prognostic factors was observed. The results of the subgroup RPA class analyses were similar to the entire cohort. CONCLUSION: Patient outcome for the RT-alone arm was not significantly different from OP + RT. SRS-incorporating treatment offers excellent LC rates. RPA class and the presence of extracerebral metastases demonstrated a significant prognostic role for survival. The latter should be used as stratification factors in randomized trials and can help define the cohort of patients that may benefit from more aggressive therapies.",cancer
"Radiofrequency ablation for benign aldosterone-producing adenoma: a scarless technique to an old disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating primary aldosteronism (PA) due to aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation is an established technique for treating malignant solid organ neoplasm. Its application on benign functional adrenal adenoma has never been prospectively described. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a patient cohort with computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous RFA performed on functional APA of size 4 cm or less. Treatment success was defined as complete tumor ablation on follow-up CT scan plus normalization of serum aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) at 3 to 6 months after RFA. Salvage laparoscopic adrenalectomy was offered to patients who had failed RFA and remained hypertensive. RESULTS: Between August 2004 and August 2008, 28 patients were referred for the procedure. Radiofrequency ablation was not performed on 4 APA because of their close proximity to major vascular structures. Twenty-four patients (11 men and 13 women) with a median age of 51.5 (range = 34-63) years underwent RFA for 11 right and 13 left APA. The median tumor diameter was 16.0 (range = 4.0-25.0) mm. There was no periprocedure hypertensive crisis or major morbidity or mortality. Minor complications occurred in 4 patients (16.7%), including 1 small pneumothorax and 3 retroperitoneal hematomas (< 3 cm), which all resolved on conservative treatment. At 3 to 6 months of follow-up, CT scan showed complete tumor ablation in all patients (100%). Primary aldosteronism was biochemically resolved in 23 patients (95.8%). Salvage adrenalectomy was not performed in the single failed patient, as she remained normotensive on repeated follow-up. The overall success rate of RFA was 95.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography-guided percutaneous RFA is a safe and efficacious alternative to laparoscopic adrenalectomy in treating patients with PA due to small APA.",cancer
"Pure desmoplastic melanoma: a melanoma with distinctive clinical behavior. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the excision margin necessary for desmoplastic melanoma (DM). BACKGROUND: DM consists of 2 histologic subtypes, pure DM (PDM) and mixed DM (MDM), differing in extent of fibrotic component. We investigated clinical and therapeutic determinants of prognosis in these DM entities. METHODS: We reviewed 118 PDM and 124 MDM treated at our Institute over 25 years. Local relapse, distant metastasis, and survival were studied. RESULTS: Most (91.7%) distant metastases in PDM developed after 1 or more local recurrences; whereas distant metastasis usually (79.6%) occurred as first event in MDM. Overall mortality trends in relation to lesion-thickness-plus-excision-width differed for PDM (P = 0.014) but not MDM (P = 0.185). For PDM, 5-year crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of mortality was higher (40.0%) for thin tumors (</= 2 mm thick) excised with 1 cm margin than those excised with 2 cm (14.8%); CCI of mortality for PDM > 2 mm thick excised with 2 cm margins (13.4%) was similar to that for thin PDM lesions excised with 2 cm (14.8%). CCI of local recurrence was also greater in PDM excised with 1 cm margins. In MDM, mortality increased with stage but was independent of excision width (CCI: 29.4% for </= 2 mm/2 cm, 31.3% for </= 2 mm/1 cm, and 48.3% for > 2 mm/2 cm); a similar trend was found for MDM distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: In PDM, limited excision width is associated with significantly greater local recurrence and mortality; treatment should be excision with 2 cm margins even for thin lesions. MDM behaves similarly to other melanomas; treatment should follow guidelines on melanoma management.",cancer
"B7-h3 ligand expression by primary breast cancer and associated with regional nodal metastasis. OBJECTIVE: : B7 ligand family members have been shown to be important immunoregulatory factors in host tumor immune responses. We hypothesized that B7-H3, a coinhibitory factor, is expressed by primary breast cancer cells and associated with metastasis to regional tumor-draining lymph nodes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: : American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III primary breast cancers (n = 82) and normal breast specimens (n = 17) were assessed for B7-H3 expression using paraffin-embedded archival tissues. B7-H3 expression by breast cancer cells was assessed by a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and B7-H3 protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: : B7-H3 mRNA expression was detected in 32 of 82 (39%) primary breast tumors but not in normal breast tissues (P = 0.0029). B7-H3 expression in primary tumors significantly correlated with increasing tumor size, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P = 0.0071). B7-H3 expression was highly correlated to sentinel lymph node and overall number of lymph nodes with metastasis P = 0.003, and P = 0.004, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, B7-H3 mRNA expression of the primary tumor significantly predicted metastasis to regional lymph nodes (P = 0.021, and P = 0.023, respectively). Antibody staining analysis of paraffin-embedded archival tissue breast tumors and flow cytometry of breast cancer cell lines demonstrated B7-H3 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: : B7-H3 protein expressed by primary breast cancer cells is a tumor progression factor and is associated with extent of regional nodal metastasis.",cancer
"Does hepatic pedicle clamping affect disease-free survival following liver resection for colorectal metastases? OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of liver ischemia from hepatic pedicle clamping (HPC) on long-term outcome after hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). BACKGROUND: Liver resection offers the only chance of cure for patients with CRLM. Several clinical and pathologic factors have been reported as determinants of poor outcome after hepatectomy for CRLM. A controversial issue is that hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury from HPC may adversely affect long-term outcome by accelerating the outgrowth of residual hepatic micrometastases. METHODS: Patients undergoing liver resection for CRLM in 2 tertiary referral centers, between 1992 and 2008, were included. Disease-free survival and specific liver-free survival were analyzed according to the use, type, and duration of HPC. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-three patients had primary hepatectomy for CRLM. Hepatic pedicle clamping was performed in 355 patients (65.4%), and intermittently applied in 254 patients (71.5%). Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were 1.3% and 18.5%, respectively. Hepatic pedicle clamping had a highly significant impact in reducing the risk of blood transfusions and was not correlated with significantly higher postoperative morbidity. Liver recurrence rate was not significantly different according to the use, type, and duration of HPC, in patients resected after preoperative chemotherapy as well. On univariate analysis, HPC did not significantly affect overall and disease-free survival. These results were confirmed on the multivariate analysis where blood transfusions, primary tumor nodal involvement, and the size of CRLM of more than 5 cm prevailed as determinants of poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the safety and effectiveness of HPC and demonstrates that in the human situation, there is no evidence that HPC may adversely affect long-term outcome after hepatectomy for CRLM.",cancer
"Intraoperative bacterial translocation detected by bacterium-specific ribosomal rna-targeted reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the mesenteric lymph node strongly predicts postoperative infectious complications after major hepatectomy for biliary malignancies. BACKGROUND: There is little evidence indicating a causal linkage between bacterial translocation and postoperative infectious complication (POIC) in human studies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the occurrence of bacterial translocation in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and POIC with a sensitive quantitative method using bacterium-specific ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-targeted reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). METHODS: Patients who underwent major hepatectomy for biliary malignancies involving hepatic hilus were included in this study (n = 65). Mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested from the jejunal mesentery 2 times during the operation (MLN-1 harvested at laparotomy and MLN-2 harvested after tumor resection). Microorganisms were detected by a bacterium-specific rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR method. Perioperative factors and POIC were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: Of 65 patients, 51 completed the study. Microorganisms were detected in MLN-1 and MLN-2 in 15 (29.4%) and 19 (37.3%) patients, respectively. The detection of microorganisms in MLN-1 was significantly correlated with the incidence of preoperative cholangitis (P = 0.04), whereas the detection of microorganisms in MLN-2 was significantly correlated with the incidence of POIC (P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, a positive result for detection of microorganisms in MLN-2 was one of the independent predictive factors of POIC (odds ratio = 26.1). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative analysis of MLNs (especially MLN-2) by rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR can strongly predict the occurrence of POIC after hepatectomy for biliary malignancy. This method is more sensitive and faster at detection of microorganisms than the conventional culture method. Therefore, we can obtain the information of bacterial translocation immediately after the surgery and can select the group of patients with high risk for POIC.",cancer
"Laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases: surgical and long-term oncologic outcome. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the immediate and long-term outcome after laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases and difference between observed and predicted [Fong's and Basingstoke Predictive Index (BPI) scores] survivals. BACKGROUND: : Laparoscopic liver resection has been reported safe and feasible and improves postoperative course. The oncologic outcomes after resection of colorectal metastases are poorly reported. METHODS: Between August 1998 and January 2010, 122 patients underwent laparoscopic resection for colorectal liver metastases during 135 procedures at Rikshospitalet. Patients undergoing surgery between August 1998 and June 2009 were included in research analysis. The patients had median Fong's and BPI's scores of 2 (0-5) and 7 (0-23), respectively. Mainstream analysis of hospital data was done on intent-to-treat basis. Intraoperative incidents and postoperative complications were analyzed according to the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications. Median follow-up was 24 (0-100) months. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one liver resections were performed in 107 patients during 118 procedures: 117 nonanatomic and 34 anatomic liver resections. There were 5 conversions to laparotomy (4.2%). The resection margin was free of tumor tissue in 141 (93.4%) of 151 specimens, and the distance between the resection margin and tumor tissue was median 6 (0-40) mm. Intraoperative incidents occurred in 14 cases (11.9%), including 5 (4.2%), 8 (6.8%), and 1 (0.8%) cases of grades I, II, and III, respectively. Postoperative complications were observed in 16 cases (14.3%), including 2, 3, 7, 3, 0, and 1 cases of grades I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and V, respectively. During follow-up, 21 patients received repeat liver resection of recurrences (11 by laparoscopy and 10 by laparotomy). The 5-year overall survival rates were 51% as laparoscopically completed cases and 47% as intent-to-treat. The observed actuarial survival values exceeded the values expected by Fong's and BPI's score, with 10.2% and 6.7% as laparoscopically completed cases and with 3.8% and 2.4% as intent-to-treat, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic resection is a favorable alternative to open liver resection for patients with colorectal liver metastases. The observed actuarial survival values after laparoscopic resection surpass the values expected by major scoring systems.",cancer
"Pathologic complete response of primary tumor following preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: long-term outcomes and prognostic significance of pathologic nodal status (KROG 09-01). OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term outcomes of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients with postchemoradiotherapy (post-CRT) pathologic complete response of primary tumor (ypT0) and determine prognostic significance of post-CRT pathologic nodal (ypN) status. BACKGROUND: LARC patients with post-CRT pathologic complete response were suggested to have favorable long-term outcomes, but prognostic significance of ypN status has never been specifically defined in ypT0 patients. METHODS: The Korean Radiation Oncology Group collected clinical data for 333 LARC patients with ypT0 following preoperative CRT and curative radical resections between 1993 and 2007. Sphincter preservation surgery and abdominoperineal resection were performed in 283 (85.0%) and 50 (15.0%) patients, respectively. Postoperative chemotherapy was given to 285 (85.6%) patients. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: After median follow-up of 43 (range = 14-172) months, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 84.6% and overall survival (OS) was 92.8%. The ypN status was ypT0N0 in 304 (91.3%), ypT0N1 in 22 (6.6%), and ypT0N2 in 7 (2.1%) patients. The ypN status was the most relevant independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS in ypT0 patients. The 5-year DFS and OS was 88.5% and 94.8% in ypT0N0 patients, and 45.2% and 72.8% in ypT0N+ patients (both, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LARC patients achieving ypT0N0 after preoperative CRT had favorable long-term outcomes, whereas positive ypN status had a poor prognosis even after total regression of primary tumor.",cancer
"Elastica staining for venous invasion results in superior prediction of cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic implications of routine elastica staining for venous invasion on prediction of cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Venous invasion is an important high risk feature in colorectal cancer, although prevalence in published studies ranges from 10% to 90%. To resolve the disparity, elastica stains have been used in our institution to provide a more objective judgment since 2002. METHODS: The study included 419 patients undergoing curative elective colorectal cancer resection between 1997 and 2006. Patients were grouped prior to (1997-2001 [cohort 1]) and following the introduction of elastica staining (2003-2006 [cohort 2]). FINDINGS: Clinicopathologic characteristics and 3-year survival rates were similar in both groups. Rate of detected venous invasion increased from 18% to 58% following introduction of elastica staining (P < 0.001). The 3-year cancer-specific survival rate associated with the absence of venous invasion was 84% in cohort 1, compared with 96% in cohort 2 (P < 0.01). Elastica staining improved the prognostic value of venous invasion, showing the area under the receiver operator curve rising from 0.59 (P = 0.040; 1997-2001) to 0.68 (P < 0.001; 2003-2006), using cancer mortality as an end point. A direct comparison between H&E alone and elastica Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) was made in 53 patients. The area under the receiver operator curve increased from 0.58, P = 0.293 (H&E alone) to 0.74, P = 0.003 for venous invasion detected using the elastica method. CONCLUSIONS: Increased detection of venous invasion with elastica staining, compared with H&E staining, provides superior prediction of cancer survival in colorectal cancer. This relationship was seen in the comparison of 2 consecutive cohorts and in a direct comparison in a single cohort. Based on these results, elastica staining should be incorporated into the routine pathologic assessment of venous invasion in colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Factors predicting the quality of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine preoperative tumor-, patient-, and treatment-related factors that are independently associated with incomplete mesorectal excision. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Incomplete total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer is associated with increased local and overall recurrences. Factors predicting incomplete mesorectal excision have scarcely been studied. METHODS: In the context of PROCARE, a Belgian multidisciplinary project on rectal cancer, the quality of 266 consecutive and anonymized TME specimens submitted by 33 candidate-TME-trainers was graded by a blinded pathology review board in a standardized manner. Uni- and multivariable analysis were performed to identify factors that can independently predict incomplete mesorectal excision. RESULTS: Mesorectal resection was complete in 21%, nearly complete in 47%, and incomplete in 32%. Of 57% of TME specimens the grade of resection had not been reported by the local pathologist. Incomplete TME doubled the incidence of a positive circumferential resection margin (P = 0.004). Factors found to be significantly related to incomplete TME in univariate analysis were as follows: surgeon, female gender, pathologic body mass index, low rectal cancer, negative clinical nodal status, the absence of downstaging after long-course chemoradiation, laparoscopic and converted laparoscopic resection, and abdominoperineal resection. Multivariable analysis identified pathologic body mass index (P = 0.017), the absence of downstaging after long-course chemoradiation (P = 0.0005), and laparoscopic or converted laparoscopic resection (P = 0.014) as factors that are independently associated with incomplete mesorectal excision. CONCLUSION: Good TME quality cannot be guaranteed. This peer-reviewed TME assessment revealed a number of factors that are independently related to incomplete TME. Both specimen and pathology report need to be audited.",cancer
"A randomized trial comparing radiofrequency ablation and surgical resection for HCC conforming to the Milan criteria. OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term outcomes of surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a promising, emerging therapy for small HCC. Whether it is as effective as surgical resection (RES) for long-term outcomes is still indefinite. METHODS: Two hundred thirty HCC patients who met the Milan criteria and were suitable to be treated by either RES or RFA entered into a randomized controlled trial. The patients were regularly followed up after treatment for 5 years (except for those who died). The primary end point was overall survival; the secondary end points were recurrence-free survival, overall recurrence, and early-stage recurrence. RESULTS: The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year overall survival rates for the RFA group and the RES group were 86.96%, 76.52%, 69.57%, 66.09%, 54.78% and 98.26%, 96.52%, 92.17%, 82.60%, 75.65%, respectively. The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates for the 2 groups were 81.74%, 59.13%, 46.08%, 33.91%, 28.69% and 85.22%, 73.92%, 60.87%, 54.78%, 51.30%, respectively. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were significantly lower in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.017). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year overall recurrence rates were 16.52%, 38.26%, 49.57%, 59.13%, and 63.48% for the RFA group and 12.17%, 22.60%, 33.91%, 39.13%, and 41.74% for the RES group. The overall recurrence was higher in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection may provide better survival and lower recurrence rates than RFA for patients with HCC to the Milan criteria.",cancer
"Thyroid transcription factor-1 expression in breast carcinomas. Immunostaining for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is frequently used to help assess the site of origin of metastatic carcinomas. TTF-1 expression is most frequently seen in carcinomas of thyroid and lung origin. Furthermore, it has been assumed that the expression of TTF-1 in a carcinoma excludes the possibility of a breast origin. We have recently encountered in our consultation practice 4 cases of invasive breast carcinoma (confirmed by clinical findings and other immunophenotypic features) that showed unequivocal tumor cell expression of TTF-1. However, the frequency with which TTF-1 expression is observed in breast carcinomas is unknown. To address this, we carried out immunostaining for TTF-1 on 546 primary breast carcinomas submitted for routine estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and/or HER2 testing. Cases were considered TTF-1 positive if they showed any nuclear staining for this marker. TTF-1 expression was identified in 13 cases (2.4%). Expression varied from focal and weak to diffuse and strong and was seen in both invasive and in situ components. We conclude that a small proportion of breast carcinomas show TTF-1 expression. Therefore, the presence of TTF-1 immunoreactivity in a carcinoma cannot by itself be used to exclude the possibility of a breast origin.",cancer
"Macroscopic sertoli cell nodule: a study of 6 cases that presented as testicular masses. Sertoli cell nodules are almost always incidental microscopic lesions found in both cryptorchid and normally descended testes. Sertoli cell nodules, when present as masses or ultrasonographic lesions, may create diagnostic confusion. Herein, we report 6 cases of macroscopic Sertoli cell nodules that were received in consultation. The referral diagnoses included Sertoli cell tumor (2 cases), sex cord tumor with annular tubules (1 case), and gonadoblastoma (1 case). The patients were 19 to 36 years old: 3 patients presented with palpable testicular masses and 3 with lesions that were worrisome for neoplasms in ultrasonographic examinations conducted for pain (2 cases) or infertility (1 case). All were phenotypically normal male patients who lacked endocrine symptoms. The Sertoli cell nodules ranged from 6 to 10 mm in diameter and on microscopic examination consisted of circumscribed proliferations of immature Sertoli cells, globules and trabeculae of basement membrane, and spermatogonia in varying proportions. In 2 cases the lesion was distinctly intratubular, consisting of closely packed tubules containing various components; in the other cases there was confluent growth of the tubules. Immunostains for alpha-inhibin highlighted the Sertoli cells (5 of 5 cases), with the germ cells appearing in negative relief. An antibody for testis-specific protein, Y-encoded (TSPY), stained the spermatogonia (2 of 2 cases), whereas OCT 3/4 was negative in all the cases (5 of 5 cases). We conclude that Sertoli cell nodules may present clinically as mass lesions, and that it is important to distinguish them from true neoplasms to avoid unnecessary procedures.",cancer
"Expression of Her-2 in carcinomas of the esophagus. The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 gene (HER-2) encodes for a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase (Her-2), which is overexpressed in various human cancers. Her-2-targeted therapy has recently been shown to be beneficial for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Her-2 protein expression was investigated in 341 esophageal carcinomas [152 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 189 adenocarcinomas (AC)], 39 cases of Barrett mucosa, and 11 cases of squamous cell dysplasia. HER-2 gene amplification was assessed by colorimetric in-situ hybridization. Positive Her-2 status was found in 15.3% of ACs and 3.9% of SCCs. Positive Her-2-status was more common in dysplastic Barrett mucosas compared with nondysplastic ones (P=0.04). In 26% of the patients with ACs who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=39), the Her-2 status of pretherapeutic biopsies was different compared with subsequent surgical specimens. There was no statistically significant correlation between Her-2 status and patients' survival. Although Her-2 overexpression is rare in SCCs, it is found in 15.3% of ACs, where amplification of HER-2 gene and overexpression of Her-2 protein seem to be early events in carcinogenesis. The evaluation of Her-2 status in tumor biopsies and in particular in the context with possible alterations after neoadjuvant treatment can potentially lead to false Her-2-staging. Although Her-2-overexpression in esophageal cancer seems to have no influence on patients' survival, these subtypes of esophageal ACs have to be considered as targets for an anti-Her-2 therapy.",cancer
"Prostate cancer topography and patterns of lymph node metastasis. Pelvic lymph node (LN) metastasis is a well-recognized route of prostate cancer spread. However, the relationship between topography and the pathologic features of primary prostatic cancers and patterns of pelvic LN metastasis has not been well studied. We reviewed original slides of radical prostatectomies and pelvic LN dissections from 125 patients with LN metastasis and recorded a total number of LN excised/laterality of positive LN, and localization, staging parameters, lymphovascular invasion, and volume of primary tumors. LN QUANTITY AND DISTRIBUTION: 14.6 (mean) and 13 (median) LNs were resected. Seventy-six (61%), 33 (26%), and 16 (13%) cases had 1, 2, and >2 positive LNs; whereas 58, 44, and 20 cases had LN metastasis on the right, left, and bilaterally. PATHOLOGIC FEATURES: Eighty-six percent (108 of 125) and 37% (46 of 125) of the cases showed extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion, whereas 64% cases showed lymphovascular invasion. Mean and median total tumor volumes were 6.39 and 3.92 cm, with >/=50% and >/=90% Gleason patterns 4/5 in 105 (84%) and 73 (58%) cases, respectively. CORRELATION WITH DOMINANT TUMOR LOCATION: Dominant lesions on radical prostatectomy were as follows: 50 right lobe, 44 left lobe, and 31 bilateral lobe tumors. Fifteen of 50 (30%) right lobe and 18 of 44 (41%) left lobe dominant tumors had LN metastasis on the contralateral side. Only 4% (5 of 125) of the cases were associated with anterior dominant tumors. CONCLUSION: Thirty percent to 40% of LN metastases occurred contralateral to the dominant tumor. LN metastasis is overwhelmingly associated with high-grade, high-stage, and large volume disease. LN positivity is rarely associated with anterior dominant tumors.",cancer
"Primary leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas: study of 9 cases and review of literature. Primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas are rare lesions and not well described, yet they are the most common primary pancreatic sarcoma. English-language medical literature reports 29 cases as single cases or small series. A systematized nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED) search of Mayo Clinic surgical pathology files from 1994 to 2006 identified 22 primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas. Nine patients with pancreatic leiomyosarcoma were diagnosed and treated at our institution (5 males and 4 females; mean age at diagnosis, 63 y; range, 39 to 87 y) are described, with a literature review. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA (EBER) was conducted in all cases to exclude EBV-associated smooth muscle tumor (EBV-SMT). Seven of the 9 patients presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice. Seven tumors (mean, 10.7 cm; range, 1.0 to 30 cm) were located in the pancreatic head and 2 in the tail. Histologic findings of primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas (7 spindle and 2 epithelioid) were similar to leiomyosarcomas of other sites. All tumors stained positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin and negative for KIT. No case showed EBER positivity. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was done in 4 patients; 3 patients had palliative procedures, and 2 had biopsy only. No lymph node metastasis was identified in 4 resected tumors, but liver metastases were present in 4 patients. All patients died; 5 deaths were known to be disease related (overall mean survival, 31 months; range, 5 to 98 mo). Historical cases showed similar clinicopathologic findings. These pancreatic leiomyosarcoma lesions have the same morphologic features as their counterparts of other sites. EBER testing should be conducted--especially for pediatric patients--to rule out EBV-SMT. The tumor is likely to metastasize to liver but not regional lymph nodes. Extensive surgical resection should be advocated, even when morphologic results show a low-grade lesion.",cancer
"Oct4 expression in immature teratoma of the ovary: relevance to histologic grade and degree of differentiation. Immature teratoma of the ovary is an uncommon tumor comprising 1% of ovarian malignancies. The amount of immature neuroepithelium in the teratoma is an important prognostic factor. Although the current grading system based on this criterion is widely accepted, the biological significance of immature neuroepithelium is poorly understood. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of Oct4 (also known as Oct3 or POU5F1), a transcription factor expressed in primordial germ cells and embryonic stem cells, along with that of PAX6, a transcription factor contributing to neurogenesis, and CD56, a known marker for tumors of neural origin, in 18 cases of pure immature teratoma of the ovary. Oct4 was expressed in the immature neuroepithelium of all 7 grade-3 cases and 2 grade-2 cases. It was not expressed in 4 grade-2 cases and all 5 grade-1 cases. These tumor cells lacked CD30 or alpha-fetoprotein expression, which supported the diagnosis of pure immature teratoma. PAX6 was expressed in the immature neuroepithelium of all immature teratomas, but not in Oct4-positive cells. CD56 was expressed in neural components of various maturities including PAX6-positive immature neuroepithelium, but not in Oct4-positive cells. These data suggest that the expression of these markers probably reflects the differentiation status of neural tissue in immature teratomas. The finding that Oct4 expression was exclusively detected in immature neuroepithelium of high-grade immature teratomas indicates that Oct4 might serve as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of highly malignant cases of immature teratoma.",cancer
"Cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas have distinctive features and include 2 subsets. Cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas (CMZL) were segregated in the WHO/EORTC consensus classification but grouped with other MALT lymphomas in the subsequent WHO classification. It has been suggested, however, that CMZL have distinctive features and might include 2 subsets. To address these issues, the clinicopathologic, phenotypic and, when possible, genotypic features of 29 CMZL with plasmacytic differentiation were assessed. The monotypic plasma cells had class-switched heavy chain expression in 22 cases, technically inadequate staining in 1 case (included with class-switched cases for analysis) and 6 were IgM. The class-switched cases had a predominance of T cells in 22 out of 23 cases with a CD4:CD8>1 in 15 out of 16 cases, usually showed nodules and scattered small B cells often with IgD apparently nonneoplastic follicles, lacked CXCR3 B-cell expression, never showed a totally diffuse growth pattern, often had prominent mast cells, and lacked known extracutaneous involvement. The IgM cases showed a predominance of B cells in 5 out of 6 (P=0.0003), a diffuse proliferation of CD20 B cells in all (P<0.0001), CXCR3+ B cells in 2 out of 5 (P<0.04), and extracutaneous disease in 3 out of 6 (P<0.008). CD21 usually disrupted follicular dendritic meshworks were seen in 9 out of 12 class-switched and 5 out of 5 IgM cases. CD123 plasmacytoid dendritic cells, PD1+ T follicular helper cells, CD25 or FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, and TIA1/granzyme B cytotoxic cells were never numerous. Only 1 out of 14 tested cases showed a low-level clonal/oligoclonal T cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement. These findings support the presence of 2 types of cutaneous MALT lymphomas with the class-switched cases being the most distinctive but still sharing significant features with MALT lymphomas from other sites, specifically an extranodal extramedullary CD5-, CD10- indolent small B cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation, frequent benign follicular structures, and not fulfilling the criteria for any other well-defined lymphoma.",cancer
"A histology-based model for predicting microsatellite instability in colorectal cancers. Identifying colorectal cancers (CRCs) with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is clinically important. MSI-H is a positive prognostic marker for CRC, a predictive marker for resistance to standard 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, and an important feature for identifying individuals and families with Lynch syndrome. Our aim was to compare and improve upon the existing predictive pathology models for MSI-H CRCs. We tested 2 existing models used to predict MSI-H tumors, (1) Revised Bethesda Guidelines and (2) MsPath, in our population-based cohort of CRCs diagnosed less than 75 years from Newfoundland (N=710). We also scored additional histologic features not described in the other models. From this analysis, we developed a model for the prediction of MSI-H CRCs; Pathologic Role in Determination of Instability in Colorectal Tumors (PREDICT). An independent pathologist validated this model in a second cohort of all CRCs (N=276). Tumor histology was a better predictor of MSI status than was personal and family history of cancer. MsPath identified MSI-H CRCs with a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 37.8%, whereas the Revised Bethesda Guidelines had a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 39.5%. PREDICT included some new histology features, including peritumoral lymphocytic reaction and increased proportion of plasma cells in the tumor stroma. PREDICT was superior to both existing models in the development cohort with a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 53.9%. In the validation cohort, sensitivity was 96.9% and specificity 76.6%. We conclude that PREDICT is a good predictor of MSI-H CRC.",cancer
"Optimal immunohistochemical markers for distinguishing lung adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas in small tumor samples. The histologic subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma is important in selecting appropriate chemotherapy for patients with advanced disease. As many of these patients are not operative candidates, they are treated medically after biopsy for diagnosis. Inherent limitations of small biopsy samples can make distinguishing poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) difficult. The value of histochemical and immunohistochemical markers to help separate poorly differentiated ADC from SCC in resection specimens is well established; however, the optimal use of markers in small tissue samples has only recently been examined and the correlation of marker expression in small tissue samples with histologic subtype determined on resection specimens has not been well documented. We address this issue by examining the expression of 9 markers (p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, 34betaE12, Napsin A, mucicarmine, NTRK1, and NTRK2) on 200 cases of ADC and 225 cases of SCC in tissue microarray format to mimic small tissue specimens. The single best marker to separate ADC from SCC is p63 (for SCC: sensitivity 84%, specificity 85%). Logistic regression analysis identifies p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, Napsin A, and mucicarmine as the optimal panel to separate ADC from SCC. Reduction of the panel to p63, TTF1, CK5/6, and CK7 is marginally less effective but may be the best compromise when tissue is limited. We present an algorithm for the stepwise application of p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, Napsin A, and mucicarmine in situations in which separation of ADC from SCC in small specimens cannot be accomplished by morphology alone.",cancer
"Neoadjuvant therapy induces loss of MSH6 expression in colorectal carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are routinely used to detect abnormal DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression in colorectal carcinomas, particularly when Lynch syndrome is suspected. Complete loss of MMR protein expression is often associated with underlying microsatellite instability (MSI), and the combined results of mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), or mutS homolog 6 (MSH6) immunostains may point to the defective MMR protein in tumors with MSI. We have noted that some neoadjuvantly treated colorectal carcinomas display loss of MMR protein immunoexpression, despite a lack of underlying MSI and preserved staining in pretreatment tumor samples. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of this finding. We identified 51 neoadjuvantly treated resected colorectal cancers. Posttreatment tumor samples were immunohistochemically stained with MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 antibodies. Loss of staining for any marker was followed by analysis for MSI and assessment of MMR protein expression in pretreatment tumor samples. All of the 51 posttreatment tumor samples showed preserved MLH1, PMS2, and MSH2, but 10 posttreatment tumor samples (20%) showed decreased MSH6 staining. Of these, 9 posttreatment tumor samples displayed loss of staining in less than 100% of tumor cells, but preserved MSH6 expression in pretreatment tumor samples. One case showed a complete absence of MSH6 staining in both pretreatment and posttreatment tumor samples. All 10 cases were microsatellite stable. We conclude that extensive loss of MSH6 immunoexpression is common among neoadjuvantly treated colorectal carcinomas, but generally does not reflect underlying MSI. Therefore, diminished MSH6 staining in treated tumors should prompt immunohistochemical evaluation of pretreatment biopsy samples before genetic testing for Lynch syndrome.",cancer
"Gastric cardiac polyps: a clinicopathologic study of 330 cases. As endoscopists have become more skilled in sampling the gastroesophageal junction, pathologists are being increasingly challenged to characterize previously unknown or neglected findings. One such example is the cardiac polyp. Originally described in the radiology literature as the sentinel fold, the first histologic descriptions of polyps at the gastroesophageal junction did not appear until less than a decade ago. Current clinicopathologic information is limited and somewhat conflicting. This study was designed to define the clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic associations in patients with cardiac polyps. Using an electronic database, we extracted information on all patients who had a distal esophageal or esophagogastric junctional biopsy during a 24-month period. We then reviewed the slides of 330 adult patients diagnosed with a cardiac polyp and used semiquantitative or qualitative scales to score foveolar hyperplasia, inflammation, erosion or ulcers, epithelial type, and metaplasia. As controls we used 120,487 patients who had biopsies from the same anatomic sites during the same period, but were not diagnosed with a cardiac polyp. There were no significant differences among any clinical indications for esophagogastroduodenoscopy between study and control patients. Endoscopically, a polyp or nodule at the gastroesophageal junction was noted in 59.1% of the patients who had a histopathologic diagnosis of cardiac polyp. Histologically, Barrett mucosa, active esophagitis, and Helicobactor pylori gastritis were all significantly less common in patients with a cardiac polyp than in controls. Although relatively infrequent, synchronous hyperplastic polyps elsewhere in the stomach were significantly more common in patients than in controls. In conclusion, this large series suggests that cardiac polyps are rare but histologically distinct lesions. They are benign and are not uniquely associated with esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, reactive gastropathy, or gastritis, with or without H. pylori.",cancer
"Spectrum of pilomyxoid astrocytomas: intermediate pilomyxoid tumors. To define the spectrum of pilomyxoid morphology and to characterize the association between pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PMA) and pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), 84 cases of pediatric astrocytomas with pilomyxoid features were reviewed. Forty-two of these tumors had coexistent features of PMA and PA (""intermediate""). With the accumulation of more cytoplasm, fibrillar background, microcysts, and thickened blood vessels, these intermediate tumors were more PA-like and less like classic PMA. In the recurrent specimens, PMAs and intermediate tumors sometimes showed more prominent PA features. Both PMA and intermediate tumors involved sites outside the hypothalamus, optic chiasm, and the third ventricle. Both the existence of intermediate tumors and the finding that some PMAs and intermediate tumors mature into PA-like neoplasms over time, provided strong support for a biological relationship between PMA and PA. Additional evidence for a ""maturational effect"" was the finding that intermediate tumors occurred in patients with a median age of 36 months compared with the median age of 21 months for those with PMAs (P=0.017). Features that were often assumed to be poor prognostic indicators in gliomas, that is, necrosis, mitotic figures, and vascular proliferation, were not uncommon in typical PMAs and intermediate lesions. Further follow-up is needed to more accurately determine the prognosis of intermediate tumors.",cancer
"EBV-associated cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphoma: review of a series of 14 cases from peru in children and young adults. We have reviewed clinically, morphologically, and immunophenotypically a series of 14 Epstein-Bar virus (EBV)+ cutaneous natural killer cell (NK)/T-cell lymphoma from Peru. Most (11 out of 14) of these cases fit well into the category of Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma (HVLL), but 3 have a different clinical presentation, without facial involvement. In all 14 cases, skin lesions present in both the sun-exposed and nonexposed areas exhibited a slowly progressive relapsing course, changing from edema, to blistering, ulceration, and final scarring. The immunophenotype had a cytotoxic T or NK-cell lineage. The mean time of disease before admission to hospital was 69 months (range, 6 mo to 31 y). Only 2 patients had fever, hepatosplenomegaly, systemic lymphadenopathy, and a high lactate dehydrodenage (LDH) level at the time of diagnosis, whereas 10 had facial swelling. After treatment, only 4 patients remain alive, although with persistent disease. Ten patients died after a mean follow-up of 11.6 months after the initial diagnosis (range, 1 to 32 mo), because of concurrent infections (4 cases), disease progression (4 patients) or both (2 patients). Endemic Epstein-Bar virus (EBV)-positive cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in childhood and early adulthood are characterized by a protracted clinical course, eventually leading to an aggressive phase characterized by concurrent infections and disease progression.",cancer
"Fetal lung interstitial tumor (FLIT): A proposed newly recognized lung tumor of infancy to be differentiated from cystic pleuropulmonary blastoma and other developmental pulmonary lesions. The differential diagnosis of congenital lung lesions includes a variety of pulmonary malformations, and uncommon or rare neoplasms such as the pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) and congenital peribronchial myofibroblastic tumor (CPMT). Although most of the congenital lesions have a predominantly cystic appearance, the exceptions of a more solid process are the type 3 congenital cystic adenomatoid or pulmonary airway malformation (CCAM-CPAM) and the CPMT. The clinical and pathologic features of a unique solid or mixed solid/cystic lung mass composed of immature interstitial mesenchyme in association with irregular airspace-like structures mimicking abnormal incompletely developed lung are presented in this report of 10 infants (7 males, 3 females) whose tumor-like lesions were detected in the prenatal period to 3 months of age (median, 1-day old). A lobectomy was done in all 10 infants and 1 infant received adjuvant chemotherapy. One of the surgical resections occurred as an ex utero, antenatal procedure because of fetal ascites. There have been no reported recurrences in those patients with greater than 12 months of follow-up ranging from 15 to 182 months (9 cases). Because of the morphologic resemblance of this mass-like lesion to fetal lung at 20 to 24 weeks gestation (as though any further pulmonary development was arrested in these localized lesions), we are proposing the designation of fetal lung interstitial tumor (FLIT) whose pathogenetic relationship, if any, to type 1 (cystic) pleuropulmonary blastoma remains uncertain to date.",cancer
"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis: insights gained over 4 decades. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disease involving predominantly the lung, and there is uncertainty about its relationship to lymphoma. It affects mainly middle-aged adults, although there is a wide age range, and men are affected almost twice as often as women. Multiple nodular, usually bilateral, infiltrates are seen radiographically, and extrapulmonary involvement, especially of skin and nervous system, occurs in more than one third of the patients. Mortality rates are high, and treatment modes are not well established. Morphologically, there is a nodular polymorphous mononuclear cell infiltrate with prominent vascular infiltration and often necrosis. Varying numbers of large, often atypical, CD20-positive B-lymphocytes are present within a background containing numerous CD3-positive small T lymphocytes and scattered admixed plasma cells and histiocytes. Evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection can be shown in most cases by in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus RNA. The infiltrate is graded as 1 to 3 based on the proportion of large B cells. Morphologically, there is overlap in grades 2 and 3 with variants of large B-cell lymphoma, and many such cases show evidence of monoclonality by polymerase chain reaction. It is suggested that lymphoma (T-cell rich large B-cell or diffuse large B-cell) be diagnosed in addition to lymphomatoid granulomatosis in grades 2 and 3 to appropriately communicate the nature of the disease to clinicians.",cancer
"Reduced mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances have been made in the care of patients undergoing transplantation. We conducted a study to determine whether these advances have improved the outcomes of transplantation. METHODS: We analyzed overall mortality, mortality not preceded by relapse, recurrent malignant conditions, and the frequency and severity of major complications of transplantation, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and infectious complications, among 1418 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants at our center in Seattle in the period from 1993 through 1997 and among 1148 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants in the period from 2003 through 2007. Components of the Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score were used in regression models to adjust for the severity of illness at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: In the 2003-2007 period, as compared with the 1993-1997 period, we observed significant decreases in mortality not preceded by relapse, both at day 200 (by 60%) and overall (by 52%), the rate of relapse or progression of a malignant condition (by 21%), and overall mortality (by 41%), after adjustment for components of the PAM score. The results were similar when the analyses were limited to patients who received myeloablative conditioning therapy. We also found significant decreases in the risk of severe GVHD; disease caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal infections; and damage to the liver, kidneys, and lungs. CONCLUSIONS: We found a substantial reduction in the hazard of death related to allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation, as well as increased long-term survival, over the past decade. Improved outcomes appear to be related to reductions in organ damage, infection, and severe acute GVHD. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).",cancer
"Volume measurement of liver metastases using multidetector computed tomography: comparison of lesion diameter and volume segmentation - a phantom study. PURPOSE: To compare lesion volume determination by applying diameter measurement and three different segmentation algorithms at different slice thicknesses reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) of a phantom model for hepatic colorectal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on CT attenuation measurements obtained retrospectively from 20 patients with colorectal liver metastases, a phantom model was designed with a sponge soaked with a dilution of contrast agent and 6 embedded polyamide spheres (diameter, 8 - 30 mm) to simulate the contrast behavior of liver metastases. CT scans were obtained and reconstructed at different slice thicknesses (0.625/1.25/2.5/3.75 mm; increment, 1). One observer performed software-aided volume determination using the maximum diameter, manual segmentation, seed point method, and threshold method six times for each lesion in a randomized order. Statistical analysis revealed the absolute and relative differences from the actual lesion volumes and the intraobserver differences as well as the influence of slice thickness for each method. RESULTS: The mean relative differences of the seed point method (1.2 - 5.9%) and manual segmentation (2.6 - 4.9%) were significantly lower than the threshold method (5.4 - 12.8%) and diameter measurement (12.3 - 18.5%; p < 0.01). Volume determination by manual segmentation and the seed point method benefited from the use of thin-slice CT datasets. The intraobserver variation was lowest when using the manual segmentation (1.5 - 3.3%) and the seed point method (2.2 - 3.9%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Manual segmentation and the seed point method for thin CT slices were the methods with the lowest volume differences and intraobserver variation.",cancer
"Asymmetric cell division: recent developments and their implications for tumour biology. The ability of cells to divide asymmetrically is essential for generating diverse cell types during development. The past 10 years have seen tremendous progress in our understanding of this important biological process. We have learned that localized phosphorylation events are responsible for the asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants in mitosis and that centrosomes and microtubules play important parts in this process. The relevance of asymmetric cell division for stem cell biology has added a new dimension to the field, and exciting connections between asymmetric cell division and tumorigenesis have begun to emerge.",cancer
"MET signalling: principles and functions in development, organ regeneration and cancer. The MET tyrosine kinase receptor (also known as the HGF receptor) promotes tissue remodelling, which underlies developmental morphogenesis, wound repair, organ homeostasis and cancer metastasis, by integrating growth, survival and migration cues in response to environmental stimuli or cell-autonomous perturbations. The versatility of MET-mediated biological responses is sustained by qualitative and quantitative signal modulation. Qualitative mechanisms include the engagement of dedicated signal transducers and the subcellular compartmentalization of MET signalling pathways, whereas quantitative regulation involves MET partnering with adaptor amplifiers or being degraded through the shedding of its extracellular domain or through intracellular ubiquitylation. Controlled activation of MET signalling can be exploited in regenerative medicine, whereas MET inhibition might slow down tumour progression.",cancer
"Microgeographic variations in Burkitt's lymphoma incidence correlate with differences in malnutrition, malaria and Epstein-Barr virus. BACKGROUND: Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL) has been associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum malaria. But recent evidence suggests that other risk factors are involved. METHODS: We hypothesised that selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a surrogate of nutritional status, is an important biomarker for eBL risk. We measured plasma GPx, anthropometric markers of malnutrition, EBV viral loads and malaria parasitaemia in children aged 1-9 years (n=258) from two locations in Nyanza Province, Kenya, with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected incidence of eBL. The study participants were malaria asymptomatic children from the community. RESULTS: Children from eBL high-incidence areas had significantly lower GPx levels, high EBV viral load and more evidence of chronic malnutrition than children from eBL low-incidence areas (all P<0.001). Additionally, GPx levels were significantly lower in children with the highest EBV viral load and for those with P. falciparum infections (P=0.035 and P=0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that selenium deficiency may be a risk factor for eBL.",cancer
"Angiotensin-2 receptors (AT1-R and AT2-R), new prognostic factors for renal clear-cell carcinoma? BACKGROUND: The growth factor Angiotensin-2 signals through Angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1-R) in a broad range of cell types and tumours and through the type-2 receptor (AT2-R) in a more restricted group of cell types. Although numerous forms of cancer have been shown to overexpress AT1-R, expression of AT1-R and AT2-R by human renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCCC) is not well understood. In this study, the expression of both angiotensin receptors was quantified in a retrospective series of RCCC and correlated with prognostic factors. METHODS: Angiotensin receptor type 1 and AT2-R expressions were quantified on tumour tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). IHC results were correlated to Fuhrman's grade and patient progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 84 RCCC were analysed. By IHC, AT1-R and AT2-R were expressed to a greater level in high-grade tumours (AT1-R: P<0.001, AT2-R: P<0.001). Univariate analysis showed a correlation between PFS and AT1-R or AT2-R expression (P=0.001). By multivariate analysis, only AT2-R expression correlated with PFS (HR 1.021, P=0.006) and cancer stage (P<0.001). By western blot, AT1-R and AT1-R were also found to be overexpressed in higher Fuhrman's grade (P<0.01 and P=0.001 respectively). By qRT-PCR, AT1-R but not AT2-R mRNA were downregulated (P=0.001 and P=0.118, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results show that AT1-R and AT2-R proteins are overexpressed in the most aggressive forms of RCCC and that AT2-R expression correlates with PFS. AT1-R or AT2-R blockage could, therefore, offer novel directions for anti-RCCC therapy.",cancer
"Surveillance of screening-detected cancers (colon and rectum, breast, and cervix) - United States, 2004-2006. PROBLEM/CONDITION: Population-based screening is conducted to detect diseases or other conditions in persons before symptoms appear; effective screening leads to early detection and treatment, thereby reducing disease-associated morbidity and mortality. Based on systematic reviews of the evidence of the benefits and harms and assessments of the net benefit of screening, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends population-based screening for colon and rectum cancer, female breast cancer, and uterine cervix cancer. Few publications have used national data to examine the stage at diagnosis of these screening-amenable cancers. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2004-2006. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: Data were obtained from cancer registries affiliated with CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Combined data from the NPCR and SEER programs provide the best source of information on national population-based cancer incidence. Data on cancer screening were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This report provides stage-specific cancer incidence rates and screening prevalence by demographic characteristics and U.S. state. RESULTS: Approximately half of colorectal and cervical cancer cases and one third of breast cancer cases were diagnosed at a late stage of disease. Incidence rates of late-stage cancer differed by age, race/ethnicity, and state. Incidence rates of late-stage colorectal cancer increased with age and were highest among black men and women. Incidence rates of late-stage breast cancer were highest among women aged 60-79 years and black women. Incidence rates of late-stage cervical cancer were highest among women aged 50-79 years and Hispanic women. The percentage of persons who received recommended screening differed by age, race/ethnicity, and state. INTERPRETATION: Differences in late-stage cancer incidence rates might be explained partially by differences in screening use. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The findings in this report emphasize the need for ongoing population-based surveillance and reporting to monitor late-stage cancer incidence trends. Screening can identify colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers in earlier and more treatable stages of disease. Multiple factors, including individual characteristics and health behaviors as well as provider and clinical systems factors, might account for why certain populations are underscreened. Cancer control planners, including comprehensive cancer-control programs, can use late-stage cancer incidence and screening prevalence data to identify populations that would benefit from interventions to increase screening utilization and to monitor performance of early detection programs.",cancer
"Racial disparities in smoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost --- Missouri, 2003-2007. An estimated 443,000 deaths in the United States occur each year as a result of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. These deaths cost the nation approximately $97 billion in lost productivity and $96 billion in health-care costs. During 2000-2004 in Missouri, smoking caused 9,600 deaths, 132,000 years of potential life lost (YPLL), $2.4 billion in productivity losses, and $2.2 billion in smoking-related health-care expenditures annually. To limit the adverse health consequences of tobacco use, states implement comprehensive tobacco control programs that identify disparities among population groups and target those disproportionately affected by tobacco use. This report compares the public health burden of smoking among whites and blacks in Missouri by estimating the number of smoking-attributable deaths and YPLL in these population subgroups during 2003-2007. The findings indicate that the average annual smoking-attributable mortality (SAM) rate in the state was 18% higher for blacks (338 deaths per 100,000) than for whites (286 deaths per 100,000). The relative difference in smoking-attributable mortality rates between blacks and whites was larger for men (28%) than women (11%). For Missouri, these estimates provide an important benchmark for measuring the success of tobacco control programs in decreasing the burden of smoking-related diseases in these populations and reaffirm the need for full implementation of the state's comprehensive tobacco control program.",cancer
"Predicting hematologic toxicity in patients undergoing radioimmunotherapy with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or 131I-tositumomab. This study aimed at identifying clinical factors for predicting hematologic toxicity after radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or (131)I-tositumomab in clinical practice. METHODS: Hematologic data were available from 14 non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and 18 who received (131)I-tositumomab. The percentage baseline at nadir and 4 wk post nadir and the time to nadir were selected as the toxicity indicators for both platelets and neutrophils. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors (P < 0.05) of each indicator. RESULTS: For both platelets and neutrophils, pooled and separate analyses of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and (131)I-tositumomab data yielded the time elapsed since the last chemotherapy as the only significant predictor of the percentage baseline at nadir. The extent of bone marrow involvement was not a significant factor in this study, possibly because of the short time elapsed since the last chemotherapy of the 7 patients with bone marrow involvement. Because both treatments were designed to deliver a comparable bone marrow dose, this factor also was not significant. None of the 14 factors considered was predictive of the time to nadir. The R(2) value for the model predicting percentage baseline at nadir was 0.60 for platelets and 0.40 for neutrophils. This model predicted the platelet and neutrophil toxicity grade to within +/-1 for 28 and 30 of the 32 patients, respectively. For the 7 patients predicted with grade I thrombocytopenia, 6 of whom had actual grade I-II, dosing might be increased to improve treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: The elapsed time since the last chemotherapy can be used to predict hematologic toxicity and customize the current dosing method in radioimmunotherapy.",cancer
"Evaluation of metabolic characteristics and viability of lipiodolized hepatocellular carcinomas using 18F-FDG PET/CT. This study aimed to evaluate the metabolic characteristics of lipiodolized hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in assessing the viability of lipiodolized HCCs. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (age range, 32-73 y) with 38 lipiodolized HCCs who had undergone transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with lipiodol before (18)F-FDG PET/CT (2-434 d) and 55 patients (age range, 36-77 y) with 57 treatment-naive HCCs who had not been treated with TACE were retrospectively studied. All patients underwent hepatic lobectomy or transplantation within 1 mo after PET/CT and multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT. (18)F-FDG uptake by lipiodolized and naive HCCs was compared and correlated with tumor size, pathologic grade, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration, and time interval between TACE and PET/CT. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT in evaluating the viability of lipiodolized HCC was compared. RESULTS: Histologic examination showed 30 viable and 8 nonviable lipiodolized HCCs. Of the 30 viable tumors, 19 showed increased, 10 similar, and 1 decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Of the 8 nonviable HCCs, 3 showed increased and 5 decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Uptake by viable lipiodolized HCCs was correlated with tumor size (P < 0.05) but not correlated with pathologic grade, AFP concentration, or interval between TACE and PET/CT. In contrast, (18)F-FDG uptake by naive HCCs was significantly correlated with tumor size and pathologic grade (P < 0.05 for each comparison). When lipiodolized HCCs with (18)F-FDG uptake that was greater than or similar to that in the surrounding normal liver were considered viable, the diagnostic sensitivity of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT in the early postembolic period (<3 mo) was 100% and 94%, respectively, and that in the late postembolic period was 93% and 79%, respectively. The specificity of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT was 63% and 100%, respectively, in the acute period. Three viable lipiodolized HCCs with high AFP concentration were true-positives on PET/CT but false-negatives on contrast-enhanced CT images. CONCLUSION: After TACE, (18)F-FDG uptake in lipiodolized HCCs was not correlated with pathologic grade, in contrast to uptake in treatment-naive HCCs. (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed a high diagnostic sensitivity in assessing the viability of lipiodolized HCCs, with moderate specificity. This method may be useful in determining the viability of lipiodolized HCCs in patients with increased serum AFP concentration or normal results on contrast-enhanced CT images.",cancer
"Mediastinoscopy vs endosonography for mediastinal nodal staging of lung cancer: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: Mediastinal nodal staging is recommended for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Surgical staging has limitations, which results in the performance of unnecessary thoracotomies. Current guidelines acknowledge minimally invasive endosonography followed by surgical staging (if no nodal metastases are found by endosonography) as an alternative to immediate surgical staging. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 2 recommended lung cancer staging strategies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled multicenter trial (Ghent, Leiden, Leuven, Papworth) conducted between February 2007 and April 2009 in 241 patients with resectable (suspected) NSCLC in whom mediastinal staging was indicated based on computed or positron emission tomography. INTERVENTION: Either surgical staging or endosonography (combined transesophageal and endobronchial ultrasound [EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA]) followed by surgical staging in case no nodal metastases were found at endosonography. Thoracotomy with lymph node dissection was performed when there was no evidence of mediastinal tumor spread. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was sensitivity for mediastinal nodal (N2/N3) metastases. The reference standard was surgical pathological staging. Secondary outcomes were rates of unnecessary thoracotomy and complications. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-one patients were randomized, 118 to surgical staging and 123 to endosonography, of whom 65 also underwent surgical staging. Nodal metastases were found in 41 patients (35%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27%-44%) by surgical staging vs 56 patients (46%; 95% CI, 37%-54%) by endosonography (P = .11) and in 62 patients (50%; 95% CI, 42%-59%) by endosonography followed by surgical staging (P = .02). This corresponded to sensitivities of 79% (41/52; 95% CI, 66%-88%) vs 85% (56/66; 95% CI, 74%-92%) (P = .47) and 94% (62/66; 95% CI, 85%-98%) (P = .02). Thoracotomy was unnecessary in 21 patients (18%; 95% CI, 12%-26%) in the mediastinoscopy group vs 9 (7%; 95% CI, 4%-13%) in the endosonography group (P = .02). The complication rate was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with (suspected) NSCLC, a staging strategy combining endosonography and surgical staging compared with surgical staging alone resulted in greater sensitivity for mediastinal nodal metastases and fewer unnecessary thoracotomies.

"Chlamydia trachomatis and risk of prevalent and incident cervical premalignancy in a population-based cohort. BACKGROUND: Cofactors might affect the risk of the rare progression from infection with carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) to cervical premalignancy to invasive cancer. Some studies have observed that Chlamydia trachomatis infection is associated with increased risk for cervical cancer. In a large prospective cohort, we assessed the role of C trachomatis in cervical premalignancy and addressed confounding by HPV. METHODS: We identified 182 women with prevalent and 132 women with incident histological cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2), grade 3 (CIN3), or cervical cancer (CIN2+) in the Costa Rica HPV Natural History Study. Control subjects were 995 (approximately 10% of the 10 049) subjects who were randomly selected from the same study. Cervical HPV status at enrollment was determined by MY09/MY11 polymerase chain reaction amplification and dot-blot hybridization. The presence of C trachomatis DNA in cervical exfoliated cells at enrollment was determined by a novel serovar-specific polymerase chain reaction-based C trachomatis detection and genotyping assay. Plasma drawn at enrollment from each subject was used to determine C trachomatis immunoglobulin G (IgG) status. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between C trachomatis and CIN2+, taking into account possible confounding by HPV. RESULTS: C trachomatis positivity at enrollment was associated with CIN2+ and concurrent and subsequent carcinogenic HPV infection. To account for confounding by HPV status, we restricted the analysis to women positive for carcinogenic HPV DNA at enrollment and found no association between C trachomatis status (as assessed by DNA or IgG) at enrollment and combined prevalent and/or incident CIN2+ (for C trachomatis DNA positivity, odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval = 0.42 to 1.41; for C trachomatis seropositivity, odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 0.85 to 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between C trachomatis status, as assessed by DNA or IgG, and risk of cervical premalignancy, after controlling for carcinogenic HPV-positive status. Previous positive associations between C trachomatis and cervical premalignancy could have been caused, in part, by an increased susceptibility to HPV infection.",cancer
"The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets and colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND: Although the Mediterranean diet has been studied for cancer mortality and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet shares similarities with the Mediterranean diet, few studies have specifically examined these 2 diets and incident colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to prospectively assess the association between the Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMed) and the DASH-style diet scores and risk of colorectal cancer in middle-aged men and women. DESIGN: A total of 87,256 women and 45,490 men (age 30-55 y for women and 40-75 y for men at baseline) without a history of cancer were followed for </= 26 y. The aMed and DASH scores were calculated for each participant by using dietary information that was assessed </= 7 times during follow-up. Relative risks (RRs) for colorectal cancer were computed with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: We documented 1432 cases of incident colorectal cancer among women and 1032 cases in men. Comparing top with bottom quintiles of the DASH score, the pooled RR for total colorectal cancer was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.91; P for trend = 0.0001). The corresponding RR for DASH score and colon cancer was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.95; P for trend = 0.002). There was a suggestion of an inverse association with rectal cancer with a pooled RR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.98; P for trend = 0.31) when comparing top with bottom quintiles of DASH score. No association was observed with aMed score. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the DASH diet (which involves higher intakes of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables; moderate amounts of low-fat dairy; and lower amounts of red or processed meats, desserts, and sweetened beverages) was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Major urologic problems in geriatrics: assessment and management. Elderly urologic patients require the same cautions as used in development of treatment programs for them in other disciplines. Because of potential interference with poor renal function or crossover effects with central or peripheral nervous system, however, many urologic drugs must be titrated appropriately. In treating cancer, erectile dysfunction, incontinence or urinary infection, patient quality of life and life span become dominant factors in making therapeutic decisions, by behavioral change, medication, or surgical intervention.",cancer
"Use and assessment of PSA in prostate cancer. Since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the late 1980s, more prostate cancers have been detected, and at an earlier stage. As a consequence, the majority of prostate cancers are now detected years before the emergence of clinically evident disease, which usually represents locally advanced or metastatic cancer. PSA screening has remained controversial, because many of the prostate cancers detected are low grade and slow growing. With this long natural history and a median survival without treatment that often approaches at least 15 to 20 years, many clinicians and researchers have questioned if prostate cancer screening and treatment actually improves survival, as many patients will die with prostate cancer rather than of prostate cancer. In this review, the authors discuss the rationale for prostate cancer screening and present the current guidelines for the use of PSA.",cancer
"Evaluation and management of the renal mass. The evaluation and management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has evolved in recent decades in response to the changing clinical presentation of the disease. Traditional teaching suggested that RCC usually presents with signs or symptoms. However, RCC discovered this way was usually locally advanced and often metastatic, requiring radical nephrectomy in most cases but often having a poor prognosis. As contemporary general medical practice began routinely using axial body imaging in the evaluation of many nonspecific abdominal complaints, today more than 70% of RCC cases identified are ""screen-detected"" as incidental findings having no attributable symptoms. This change has prompted a significant RCC stage migration over the past 20 years, with most kidney tumors seen in 2010 being smaller, organ-confined, and appropriate for nephron-sparing approaches with the anticipation of a favorable outcome. The approach to addressing patients with these incidentally detected, often localized, small renal masses raises different concerns than those for traditional patients presenting with symptomatic RCC. This article reviews the modern epidemiology of RCC, outlines the components of the evaluation of the incidental renal mass, details the current options of management, and discusses the long-term expectations for these patients.",cancer
"Cavernous hemangioma of the orbital apex: pathogenetic considerations in surgical management. PURPOSE: To consider the pathogenesis and growth of cavernous hemangioma, particularly within the crowded orbital apex, in decisions regarding surgical indications, timing, and technique. DESIGN: A perspective based on analysis of the microanatomic relationships and growth potential of apical cavernous hemangiomas, with representative case studies illustrating management recommendations. METHODS: Analysis of microscopic findings in typical and vision-loss cases; review of tumor growth patterns as reported in observational and interventional studies; consideration of surgical approaches and reported functional outcomes. RESULTS: An ongoing, local hemodynamic imbalance may drive the proliferation of a cavernous hemangioma. Extension into neighboring tissue induces a fibrous capsule, which is continually reconstituted as the lesion expands, and which may incorporate visually critical structures in the confines of the apex. The extent of this microanatomic intimacy is not detectable preoperatively. The tumor's remaining growth potential at the time of diagnosis or following incomplete resection is not predictable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients without significant vision deficits should be observed for progression. Those with significant deficits or signs of progression should be offered timely surgery, with recognition of the risks. The surgical approach should be individualized based on macroanatomic relationships. The decision to intervene should not be a commitment to complete resection at any cost; intraoperative recognition of ""inoperable"" attachments may dictate modifications in order to preserve vision.",cancer
"Differentiation of vascular tumors from vascular malformations by expression of Wilms tumor 1 gene: evaluation of 126 cases. BACKGROUND: Vascular tumors and malformations can be challenging to diagnose. Although they may initially appear very similar, they have distinct clinical courses and management. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene expression has been reported in many different tumors including hematologic malignancies and some solid tumors. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the expression of WT1 in 126 vascular lesions (64 vascular tumors, one Masson tumor, and 61 vascular malformations). METHODS: Based on the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification of vascular anomalies, we studied the expression of WT1 in vascular tumors composed of infantile hemangioma, congenital hemangiomas (non-involuting, rapidly involuting, and not otherwise specified), pyogenic granuloma, tufted angioma, cherry angioma, Kaposi sarcoma, and angiosarcoma. We also studied WT1 expression in vascular malformations composed of angiokeratoma/verrucous hemangioma, combined vascular malformations, venous malformations, glomuvenous malformations, lymphatic malformations/lymphangioma, telangiectasia, and targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma. RESULTS: All vascular tumors and proliferations had positive WT1 cytoplasmic endothelial immunostaining whereas only 3 vascular malformations were WT1 positive. Moreover the positivity of WT1 in these vascular malformations was focal and involved only re-endothelialized neovessels within thrombi. LIMITATIONS: The low number of malignant vascular tumors is a limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical detection of WT1 could be a useful tool to routine evaluation of vascular anomalies allowing the distinction of vascular tumors and proliferations from vascular malformations. Staining for WT1 may guide the clinician in difficult cases, as positive results would suggest a proliferative vascular lesion whereas negative results might point to a vascular malformation.",cancer
"Impact of prolonged fraction delivery times simulating IMRT on cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell killing. PURPOSE: To determine the impact of prolonged fraction delivery times (FDTs) simulating intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell killing. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Cultured NPC cell lines CNE1 and CNE2 were used in this study. The biological effectiveness of fractionated irradiation protocols simulating conventional external beam radiotherapy and IMRT (FDT of 15, 36, and 50 minutes) was estimated with standard colony assay, and the differences in cell surviving fractions after irradiation with different protocols were tested by use of the paired t test. The impact degree of prolonged FDTs (from 8 to 50 minutes) on cell killing was also assessed by the dose-modifying factors, which were estimated by comparing the effectiveness of intermittently delivered 2 Gy with that of continuously delivered 1.5 to 2 Gy. RESULTS: The cell surviving fractions of both CNE1 and CNE2 after fractionated irradiation simulating IMRT were higher than those simulating conventional external beam radiotherapy (p < 0.05). The dose-modifying factors for a fraction dose of 2 Gy increased from 1.05 to 1.18 for CNE1 and from 1.05 to 1.11 for CNE2 with the FDT being prolonged from 15 to 50 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the prolonged FDTs simulating IMRT significantly decreased the cell killing in both CNE1 and CNE2 cell lines, and these negative effects increased with the FDT being prolonged from 15 to 50 minutes. These effects, if confirmed by in vivo and clinical studies, need to be considered in designing IMRT treatments for NPC.",cancer
"Case series. Soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot. BACKGROUND: We reviewed cases of soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot to gain insight into the presentation, treatments and outcomes for this rare disease and to determine whether limb-salvage surgery yields reasonable functional and oncological outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the cases of 16 patients treated by 2 of us (R.T. and M.I.) for soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot over a 15-year period. We extracted the following information from each patient's medical record: disease status at presentation, prior treatment, histological diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, details of treatment, oncological outcome and functional outcome. Functional outcome was assessed with the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) and the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS 1987). RESULTS: Follow-up averaged 6 (range 2-15) years. Eight patients presented after unplanned excision. Histological diagnosis was synovial sarcoma for 7 of 16 patients.The tumours were evenly distributed among the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot. Most patients (n = 13) presented with AJCC stage II or III disease. Amputation was necessary for 3 patients, whereas limb salvage was possible for the other 13. Free tissue transfer (n = 9) and radiation therapy (n = 12) were used in most cases. Surgical margins were microscopically positive in 4 of the 13 patients treated with limb salvage.Local disease recurred in 2 patients. Lung metastases occurred in 4 patients. At last follow-up, 11 of 16 patients were alive without disease, 2 with disease and 3 had died of their disease. Functional assessment with MSTS 1987 and the TESS averaged 28%and 90%, respectively, after limb salvage. CONCLUSION: In this series, we found that, first, patients frequently presented after unplanned excision, and this may have led to worse oncological outcomes compared with patients who presented primarily. Second, limb salvage was usually possible, but it required accepting marginal resections, relying on free tissue transfer to obtain coverage and using radiation therapy to obtain local control. Third, this combination yielded an acceptable local control rate and very good functional outcomes.",cancer
"Management of primary rectal cancer by surgeons in Atlantic Canada: results of a regional survey. BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the current practice patterns of general surgeons in Atlantic Canada in the management of primary rectal cancer in relation to surgeon-specific variables. METHODS: We sent mail-out surveys to all practising general surgeons (n = 183) in Atlantic Canada to determine screening preferences, preoperative assessment, the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, surgical therapy for rectal cancer and surgeon demographics. We analyzed the responses using chi(2) tests. RESULTS: The response rate was 98 (54%) after 2 mail-outs; there were 82 (49%) eligible responses. Surgeons in practice for 21 years or more were more likely than those with fewer than 21 years of practice to order preoperative ultrasonography of the liver and were less likely to order preoperative computed tomography. Endorectal ultrasonography was ordered routinely by 23% of surgeons, whereas 71% of surgeons would order it if time and resources were available. Surgeons who were not certified by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada were significantly more likely than those who were certified to use neoadjuvant therapy in all patients with rectal cancer (43% v. 12%; p = 0.031). Surgeons who performed more than 10 rectal cancer surgeries per year were significantly more likely than those who performed 10 or fewer surgeries per year to use neoadjuvant treatment for T3 tumours (94% v. 61%; p = 0.007). Surgeons with medical or radiation oncology services in their communities were significantly more likely than those without such services to recommend neoadjuvant treatment in T3 rectal tumours and rectal tumours with pathologic lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: We found significant variation in the management of rectal cancer depending on surgeon-specific variables. The implications of these differences on the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer are unknown.",cancer
"Effectiveness of voice rehabilitation on vocalisation in postlaryngectomy patients: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasia of the head and neck. Its incidence has been increasing steadily all over the world. Many patients will undergo total laryngectomy with or without radical neck dissection after being diagnosed. After this surgery, normal speech is lost, and a permanent stoma in the middle of the neck is left. Therefore, voice rehabilitation is one of the most difficult challenges that these patients must overcome. In order to support the patients, otolaryngologists, nursing specialists and speech pathologists have explored several different methods for voice rehabilitation. Variations exist on the approaches of rehabilitation and indicators selected to measure the effectiveness. There is a need to undertake a systematic review to provide a plan of care and ascertain the effectiveness regarding different voice rehabilitation programs for postlaryngectomy patients. REVIEW OBJECTIVE: To critically analyse the literature and present the best available evidence related to the effectiveness of voice rehabilitation program on postlaryngectomy patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was utilised. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases was undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract to identify the optimal index terms. A second extensive search using all identified key words and index terms was then undertaken. Third, the reference list and bibliographies of all identified reports and articles were searched for additional studies. The measurement index included voice intelligibility, volume, clarity, quality of voice, patients' satisfaction, quality of life, etc. The search included reports in English and Chinese. SELECTION CRITERIA: The review considered any randomised controlled trials that addressed voice rehabilitation methods in postlaryngectomy patients. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, other quantitative research designs, such as non-randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and case-controlled studies, were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Full copies of articles considered to meet the inclusion criteria were obtained for critical appraisal by two reviewers using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Program) and McMaster scales. We utilised the 60% fulfilling of the evaluation scale items as the cut-off point and articles with a quality score less than 60% were excluded. Details of eligible trials were extracted and summarised by two reviewers independently using standardised data extraction tools developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were included in the review (Appendix I). Different voice rehabilitation methods for laryngectomees were investigated in the included studies including oesophageal voice, electrolarynx voice and surgical voice restoration. One cohort studies, five prospective studies, five retrospective studies and 11 descriptive studies were included. Because of the heterogeneity of included studies, meta-analysis was not possible. Therefore, the results were presented in narrative summary. The following main findings were identified: 1 At present, oesophageal speech, electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal were the commonly used voice rehabilitation methods with total laryngectomy patients. 2 Among these three methods, the success rate of electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal is much higher than oesophageal speech. 3 The intelligibility and speech quality of electrolarynx was lower than tracheoesophageal. 4 Patient satisfaction and self-assessed quality of life was better in tracheoesophageal group. 5 The objective index was similar between excellent tracheoesophageal and oesophageal speech patients. Conclusion 1 Electrolarynx is the easiest vocal rehabilitation method for total laryngectomy patients to use as it requires little training and does not limit the patients. But patients' satisfaction was lower because of the mechanical voice and noise. 2 Oesophageal speech is the hardest vocal rehabilitation method to learn. It needs a long period of time to practise and requires the patient to be in good physical condition and to be relatively young. The success rate was relatively lower; however, it is the most commonly used rehabilitation method in developing countries because of low cost. 3 Tracheoesophageal is the most commonly used voice rehabilitation method in developed countries. It is a surgical method that could be performed as either a primary procedure or secondary procedure. Reported patient quality of life and satisfaction following tracheoesophageal were the best; however, there are complications and the frequent replacement of the prostheses is an important problem yet to be solved. Implication for practice 1 Voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy is an immediate and long-term problem that patients and health worker must face. 2 Healthcare workers should understand the advantages and disadvantages of each voice rehabilitation method in detail to assist people with total laryngectomy to make the most appropriate decision in regard to rehabilitation method taking into consideration their age, sex, physical condition, job, economic status and other context factors. Implication for research 1 Further high-quality studies comparing the effectiveness of oesophageal speech, electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal vocal rehabilitation methods are needed, especially with the subjective and objective outcome index concurrently. 2 Further investigation is required to identify strategies to decrease the complications of tracheoesophageal and reduce frequency of required tracheoesophageal replacement. 3 More research is needed in the context of developing countries where healthcare resources may be limited.",cancer
"Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy treated by surgery. A case report and the review of the literature. INTRODUCTION: Prenatal diagnosis of pheocromocytoma, although rare, is important as it allows a reduction in both maternal mortality and foetal loss. Pheocromocytoma operated on in the first trimester of pregnancy with survival of both patient and foetus is rare in literature. Our case was operated on with success after a correct and early diagnosis was obtained despite a chronic hypertension which existed long before pregnancy. Our case study well illustrates that a correct multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinologists, anesthesiologists, surgeons and gynecologists is fundamental for a positive outcome. CASE REPORT: The case of a white caucasian pregnant woman at 13th weeks of gestation with pheocromocytoma and severe and unstable hypertension that could not be pharmacologically controlled is described. Morphological diagnosis was safely obtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) without intravenous medium contrast agent. Pre-operative treatment consisted of therapy with alpha-blockers and rehydration. Adrenalectomy was performed through a laparotomy. Postoperative treatment consisted of rehydration and ephedrine continued until the fourth post-operative day. The post-operative period was uneventful and a new ultrasound (US) scan confirmed foetal vitality. The patient was discharged seven days after surgery. A live newborn was physiologically delivered after a nine-month pregnancy. CONCLUSION: A correct diagnosis in all pregnant women with severe hypertension particularly those not screened for secondary hypertension and a multidisciplinary management are mandatory to obtain optimal results and avoid deleterious effects at delivery.",cancer
"Single port laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy with the TriPort system. A case report and review of the literature. AIM: We report our recent experience with the TriPort system (trademark of Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) to perform a laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy via a single periumbilical incision. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old multiparous woman was referred to us on March 2009 because of menometrorrhagia and uterine fibroids. RESULTS: The procedure was performed without intraoperative complications. The weight of the uterus was 360 gr. At the 10 months follow-up the patient did not refer any problem. DISCUSSION: Although our experience represented a potentially difficult surgery because of the size of the uterus, severe adhesions (two previous caesarean sessions) and the lack of experience with the new system, the procedure demonstrated to be feasible. As for our knowledge the present report represents the first case of single port laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy performed with the TriPort system in Italy. CONCLUSION: Single port laparoscopy is feasible and could potentially decrease postoperative pain as well as increase patient satisfaction. Although the early experience with TriPort system is promising, experienced laparoscopic skills are essential for the safe and effective performing of the procedure.",cancer
"Pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula causing caval stenosis, left renal vein thrombosis, subcutaneous fat necrosis, arthritis and dysfibrinogenemia. AIM: We describe the case of a 38 year old man, with a story of alcohol abuse, who developed a very painful nodular subcutaneous fat necrosis, fever and polyarthritis, denying any abdominal symptoms due to a pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula. MATERIAL OF STUDY: The authors discuss the unusual and protracted course with intermittent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia related to clinical manifestations such as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, pleural effusion and dysfibrinogenemia, and vascular complications as inferior vena cava stenosis and left renal vein thrombosis without abdominal symptomatology. RESULTS: After ultrasonograms and CT Scans showing a 3-4 cm cyst at the pancreatic head with a solid bud protruding into the pseudocystic cavity, and an ERCP showing a communication between the pancreatic duct and the pseudocyst but failing in demonstrating the vascular fistula, the patient underwent a Roux-en-y pseudocyst-jejunostomy and suture of the caval communication leading to complete recovery with normalization of laboratory findings. DISCUSSION: In our case, the locally sclerosing activity of the enzymes in the endothelium led to a communication between the inferior vena cava and the pseudocyst and to a complete thrombosis of the left renal vein and to a stenosis of the inferior vena cava itself The fluctuance of the symptomatology severity was probably due to an intermittent opening of the passage between pseudocyst and vena cava. Such a clinical case, to the author knowledge, has never been reported. CONCLUSION: When in presence of very high levels of amylasemia and lipasemia in spite of the paucity of abdominal symptomatology, and the onset of unusual complications such as panniculitis, pleural effusion, arthritis and coagulative disorders, a pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula should be kept in consideration during diagnosis.",cancer
"Novel multitargeted anticancer oral therapies: sunitinib and sorafenib as a paradigm. The introduction of novel targeted therapies into the clinic in recent years has had a considerable impact on the management of several neoplastic diseases--such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hepatocellular carcinomas and renal cell carcinomas--considered until recently refractory to systemic therapies. We describe here two such novel biological agents, sunitinib and sorafenib, as a paradigm of the successful clinical application of new concepts. Sunitinib and sorafenib are small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, C-Kit and others. Both agents are administered orally; sunitinib is tyically given in cycles for 4 consecutive weeks with 2 weeks off, while sorafenib is given continually. Side effects occur in most patients, similar for both agents; they may affect several systems and organs but are mostly mild and easily manageable, rarely requiring discontinuation of the drug. However, these toxicities mandate prompt attention and intervention. The most frequently observed effects are hypertension, nausea, anorexia, asthenia and cutaneous manifestations; cardiac abnormalities may include congestive failure. Sunitinib, and markedly less frequently sorafenib, may cause thyroid gland dysfunction, mainly hypothyroidism. Antitumor activity has been shown for renal cell carcinoma in pivotal trials, for sunitinib as first-line treatment and for sorafenib in previously treated patients as second-line. Sunitinib is now approved as second-line therapy for patients with GIST refractory to imatinib; sorafenib has resulted in a significant prolongation in median survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Ongoing clinical trials will further define the spectrum of these agents' antitumor activity, their role in combination with other drugs, as well as their optimal dose and schedule of administration.",cancer
"Investigation of the eIF2alpha phosphorylation mechanism in response to proteasome inhibition in melanoma and breast cancer cells. The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex found in all eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and some eubacteria. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes pleiotropic effects in cells, including cellular apoptosis, a fact that has led to the use of the 26S proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, for treatment of the multiple myeloma cancer. We previously showed that in addition to the effects of proteolysis, inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes a rapid decrease in the protein synthesis rate due to phosphorylating alfa subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) by the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI). In order to test whether inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes the same effect in cancer cells, we have investigated the influence of two commonly used proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and MG132, on the phosphorylation status of eIF2alpha in B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer cells. It was found that both of the inhibitors caused rapid phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Taking into account that the Hsp70 is a critical component needed for the HRI activation and enzymatic activity, we have tested a possible participation of this protein in the eIF2alpha phosphorylation event. However, treatment of the cells with two structurally different Hsp70 inhibitors, quercetin and KNK437, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors did not affect the eIF2alpha phosphorylation. In addition, neither protein kinase C (PKC) nor p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was required for the proteasome inhibitor-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation; futhermore, both the PKC inhibitor staurosporine and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 caused enchanced phosphorylation of eLF2alpha. Zinc (II) protoporphyrine IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of the heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which has also been previously reported to be involved in HRI activation, also failed to prevent the induction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or MG132.",cancer
"A holistic approach to a rare pathology. A case of cystic hygroma (CH), a congenital lymph-filled multicystic hamartoma of the neck, with a holistic approach to patient management is presented. The stigma of the CH imposed by attending physicians, dentists, parents, teachers and peers affected the psychological development of this patient since her diagnosis in childhood. Although surgery relieves the threat of airway obstruction and may improve the esthetic appearance of the CH, the patient may be isolated and traumatized by the ignorance and superstitions of the individuals she encounters on a daily basis.",cancer
"A new fast and fully automated software based algorithm for extracting respiratory signal from raw PET data and its comparison to other methods. PURPOSE: Respiratory gating in PET is an approach used to minimize the negative effects of respiratory motion on spatial resolution. It is based on an initial determination of a patient's respiratory movements during a scan, typically using hardware based systems. In recent years, several fully automated databased algorithms have been presented for extracting a respiratory signal directly from PET data, providing a very practical strategy for implementing gating in the clinic. In this work, a new method is presented for extracting a respiratory signal from raw PET sinogram data and compared to previously presented automated techniques. METHODS: The acquisition of respiratory signal from PET data in the newly proposed method is based on rebinning the sinogram data into smaller data structures and then analyzing the time activity behavior in the elements of these structures. From this analysis, a 1D respiratory trace is produced, analogous to a hardware derived respiratory trace. To assess the accuracy of this fully automated method, respiratory signal was extracted from a collection of 22 clinical FDG-PET scans using this method, and compared to signal derived from several other software based methods as well as a signal derived from a hardware system. RESULTS: The method presented required approximately 9 min of processing time for each 10 min scan (using a single 2.67 GHz processor), which in theory can be accomplished while the scan is being acquired and therefore allowing a real-time respiratory signal acquisition. Using the mean correlation between the software based and hardware based respiratory traces, the optimal parameters were determined for the presented algorithm. The mean/median/range of correlations for the set of scans when using the optimal parameters was found to be 0.58/0.68/0.07-0.86. The speed of this method was within the range of real-time while the accuracy surpassed the most accurate of the previously presented algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: PET data inherently contains information about patient motion; information that is not currently being utilized. We have shown that a respiratory signal can be extracted from raw PET data in potentially real-time and in a fully automated manner. This signal correlates well with hardware based signal for a large percentage of scans, and avoids the efforts and complications associated with hardware. The proposed method to extract a respiratory signal can be implemented on existing scanners and, if properly integrated, can be applied without changes to routine clinical procedures.",cancer
"Measuring output factors of small fields formed by collimator jaws and multileaf collimator using plastic scintillation detectors. PURPOSE: As the practice of using high-energy photon beams to create therapeutic radiation fields of subcentimeter dimensions (as in intensity-modulated radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery) grows, so too does the need for accurate verification of beam output at these small fields in which standard practices of dose verification break down. This study investigates small-field output factors measured using a small plastic scintillation detector (PSD), as well as a 0.01 cm3 ionization chamber. Specifically, output factors were measured with both detectors using small fields that were defined by either the X-Y collimator jaws or the multileaf collimator (MLC). METHODS: A PSD of 0.5 mm diameter and 2 mm length was irradiated with 6 and 18 MV linac beams. The PSD was positioned vertically at a source-to-axis distance of 100 cm, at 10 cm depth in a water phantom, and irradiated with fields ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.5 to 10 x 10 cm2. The field sizes were defined either by the collimator jaws alone or by a MLC alone. The MLC fields were constructed in two ways: with the closed leaves (i.e., those leaves that were not opened to define the square field) meeting at either the field center line or at a 4 cm offset from the center line. Scintillation light was recorded using a CCD camera and an estimation of error in the median-filtered signals was made using the bootstrapping technique. Measurements were made using a CC01 ionization chamber under conditions identical to those used for the PSD. RESULTS: Output factors measured by the PSD showed close agreement with those measured using the ionization chamber for field sizes of 2.0 x 2.0 cm2 and above. At smaller field sizes, the PSD obtained output factors as much as 15% higher than those found using the ionization chamber by 0.6 x 0.6 cm2 jaw-defined fields. Output factors measured with no offset of the closed MLC leaves were as much as 20% higher than those measured using a 4 cm leaf offset. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that PSDs provide a useful and possibly superior alternative to existing dosimetry systems for small fields, as they are inherently less susceptible to volume-averaging and perturbation effects than larger, air-filled ionization chambers. Therefore, PSDs may provide more accurate small-field output factor determination, regardless of the collimation mechanism.",cancer
"Surface applicator calibration and commissioning of an electronic brachytherapy system for nonmelanoma skin cancer treatment. PURPOSE: The Xoft Axxent x-ray source has been used for treating nonmelanoma skin cancer since the surface applicators became clinically available in 2009. The authors report comprehensive calibration procedures for the electronic brachytherapy (eBx) system with the surface applicators. METHODS: The Xoft miniature tube (model S700) generates 50 kVp low-energy x rays. The new surface applicators are available in four sizes of 10, 20, 35, and 50 mm in diameter. The authors' tests include measurements of dose rate, air-gap factor, output stability, depth dose verification, beam flatness and symmetry, and treatment planning with patient specific cutout factors. The TG-61 in-air method was used as a guideline for acquiring nominal dose-rate output at the skin surface. A soft x-ray parallel-plate chamber (PTW T34013) and electrometer was used for the output commissioning. GafChromic EBT films were used for testing the properties of the treatment fields with the skin applicators. Solid water slabs were used to verify the depth dose and cutout factors. Patients with basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma were treated with eBx using a calibrated Xoft system with the low-energy x-ray source and the skin applicators. RESULTS: The average nominal dose-rate output at the skin surface for the 35 mm applicator is 1.35 Gy/min with +/- 5% variation for 16 sources. The dose-rate output and stability (within +/- 5% variation) were also measured for the remaining three applicators. For the same source, the output variation is within 2%. The effective source-surface distance was calculated based on the air-gap measurements for four applicator sizes. The field flatness and symmetry are well within 5%. Percentage depth dose in water was provided by factory measurements and can be verified using solid water slabs. Treatment duration was calculated based on the nominal dose rate, the prescription fraction size, the depth dose percentage, and the cutout factor. The output factor needs to be measured for each case with varying shapes of cutouts. CONCLUSIONS: Together with TG-61, the authors' methodology provides comprehensive calibration procedures for medical physicists for using the Xoft eBx system and skin applicators for nonmelanoma skin cancer treatments.",cancer
"Monte Carlo evaluation of scatter mitigation strategies in cone-beam CT. PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of two widely used scatter mitigation methods: antiscatter grids (ASGs) and beam modulating with bowtie filters (BTFs), in combination with subtractive scatter correction or zeroth order normalization phantom calibration, for improving image noise, contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and image uniformity for on-board cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging systems used for image-guided radiation therapy. METHODS: PTRAN Monte Carlo CBCT x-ray projections of head and pelvic phantoms were calculated for combinations of beam-modulation and scatter rejection methods and images were reconstructed by in-house developed software. In addition, a simple one-dimensional analytic model was developed to predict scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) and CNR as a function of cylindrical phantom thickness, ASG transmission, and beam modulation with bow-tie filters. RESULTS: ASGs were found to have slightly negative or no effect on head phantom image CNR and to modestly improve CNR (10%-20%) in pelvic phantom images. However, scatter subtraction and norm-phantom calibration perform better when applied on data acquired with ASGs. Scatter subtraction improves CT number accuracy, but increases noise, and in high SPR/low primary-photon transmission scenarios can dramatically reduce CNR and introduce streaking artifacts. The BTF is found to reduce SPR and image noise, resulting in a better trade-off between CNR and imaging dose, but introduces a circular band artifact. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ASGs have a modest positive impact in pelvic scans and negative in head scans, scatter subtraction improves the HU accuracy but reduces CNR, while BTF has a clearly positive effect.",cancer
"Model-based calculations of off-axis ratio of conic beams for a dedicated 6 MV radiosurgery unit. PURPOSE: Because the small-radius photon beams shaped by cones in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) lack lateral electronic equilibrium and a detector's finite cross section, direct experimental measurement of dosimetric data for these beams can be subject to large uncertainties. As the dose calculation accuracy of a treatment planning system largely depends on how well the dosimetric data are measured during the machine's commissioning, there is a critical need for an independent method to validate measured results. Therefore, the authors studied the model-based calculation as an approach to validate measured off-axis ratios (OARs). METHODS: The authors previously used a two-component analytical model to calculate central axis dose and associated dosimetric data (e.g., scatter factors and tissue-maximum ratio) in a water phantom and found excellent agreement between the calculated and the measured central axis doses for small 6 MV SRS conic beams. The model was based on that of Nizin and Mooij [""An approximation of central-axis absorbed dose in narrow photon beams,"" Med. Phys. 24, 1775-1780 (1997)] but was extended to account for apparent attenuation, spectral differences between broad and narrow beams, and the need for stricter scatter dose calculations for clinical beams. In this study, the authors applied Clarkson integration to this model to calculate OARs for conic beams. OARs were calculated for selected cones with radii from 0.2 to 1.0 cm. To allow comparisons, the authors also directly measured OARs using stereotactic diode (SFD), microchamber, and film dosimetry techniques. The calculated results were machine-specific and independent of direct measurement data for these beams. RESULTS: For these conic beams, the calculated OARs were in excellent agreement with the data measured using an SFD. The discrepancies in radii and in 80%-20% penumbra were within 0.01 cm, respectively. Using SFD-measured OARs as the reference data, the authors found that the calculated OARs were more accurate than those measured with a microchamber or film dosimetry. CONCLUSIONS: The model produces sufficiently accurate conic beam dosimetric data that can be used to validate direct measurement results for such beams.",cancer
"Characterization of a real-time surface image-guided stereotactic positioning system. PURPOSE: The AlignRT3C system is an image-guided stereotactic positioning system (IGSPS) that provides real-time target localization. This study involves the first use of this system with three camera pods. The authors have evaluated its localization accuracy and tracking ability using a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) system and an optical tracking system in a clinical setting. METHODS: A modified Rando head-and-neck phantom and five patients receiving intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) were used to evaluate the calibration, registration, and position-tracking accuracies of the AlignRT3C system and to study surface reconstruction uncertainties, including the effects due to interfractional and intrafractional motion, skin tone, room light level, camera temperature, and image registration region of interest selection. System accuracy was validated through comparison with the Elekta kV CBCT system (XVI) and the Varian frameless SonArray (FSA) optical tracking system. Surface-image data sets were acquired with the AlignRT3C daily for the evaluation of pretreatment and interfractional and intrafractional motion for each patient. Results for two different reference image sets, planning CT surface contours (CTS) and previously recorded AlignRT3C optical surface images (ARTS), are reported. RESULTS: The system origin displacements for the AlignRT3C and XVI systems agreed to within 1.3 mm and 0.7 degrees. Similar results were seen for AlignRT3C vs FSA. For the phantom displacements having couch angles of 0 degrees, those that utilized ART_S references resulted in a mean difference of 0.9 mm/0.4 degrees with respect to XVI and 0.3 mm/0.2 degrees with respect to FSA. For phantom displacements of more than +/- 10 mm and +/- 3 degrees, the maximum discrepancies between AlignRT and the XVI and FSA systems were 3.0 and 0.4 mm, respectively. For couch angles up to +/- 90 degrees, the mean (max.) difference between the AlignRT3C and FSA was 1.2 (2.3) mm/0.7 degrees (1.2 degrees). For all tests, the mean registration errors obtained using the CT_S references were approximately 1.3 mm/1.0 degrees larger than those obtained using the ART_S references. For the patient study, the mean differences in the pretreatment displacements were 0.3 mm/0.2 degrees between the AlignRT3C and XVI systems and 1.3 mm/1 degrees between the FSA and XVI systems. For noncoplanar treatments, interfractional motion displacements obtained using the ART_S and CT_S references resulted in 90th percentile differences within 2.1 mm/0.8 degrees and 3.3 mm/0.3 degrees, respectively, compared to the FSA system. Intrafractional displacements that were tracked for a maximum of 14 min were within 1 mm/1 degrees of those obtained with the FSA system. Uncertainties introduced by the bite-tray were as high as 3 mm/2 degrees for one patient. The combination of gantry, aSi detector panel, and x-ray tube blockage effects during the CBCT acquisition resulted in a registration error of approximately 3 mm. No skin-tone or surface deformation effects were seen with the limited patient sample. CONCLUSIONS: AlignRT3C can be used as a nonionizing IGSPS with accuracy comparable to current image/marker-based systems. IGSPS and CBCT can be combined for high-precision positioning without the need for patient-attached localization devices.",cancer
"Direct measurement of instantaneous source speed for a HDR brachytherapy unit using an optical fiber based detector. PURPOSE: Several attempts to determine the transit time of a high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy unit have been reported in the literature with controversial results. The determination of the source speed is necessary to accurately calculate the transient dose in brachytherapy treatments. In these studies, only the average speed of the source was measured as a parameter for transit dose calculation, which does not account for the realistic movement of the source, and is therefore inaccurate for numerical simulations. The purpose of this work is to report the implementation and technical design of an optical fiber based detector to directly measure the instantaneous speed profile of a 192Ir source in a Nucletron HDR brachytherapy unit. METHODS: To accomplish this task, we have developed a setup that uses the Cerenkov light induced in optical fibers as a detection signal for the radiation source moving inside the HDR catheter. As the 192Ir source travels between two optical fibers with known distance, the threshold of the induced signals are used to extract the transit time and thus the velocity. The high resolution of the detector enables the measurement of the transit time at short separation distance of the fibers, providing the instantaneous speed. RESULTS: Accurate and high resolution speed profiles of the 192Ir radiation source traveling from the safe to the end of the catheter and between dwell positions are presented. The maximum and minimum velocities of the source were found to be 52.0 +/- 1.0 and 17.3 +/- 1.2 cm/s. The authors demonstrate that the radiation source follows a uniformly accelerated linear motion with acceleration of [a] = 113 cm/s2. In addition, the authors compare the average speed measured using the optical fiber detector to those obtained in the literature, showing deviation up to 265%. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the authors directly measured for the first time the instantaneous speed profile of a radiation source in a HDR brachytherapy unit traveling from the unit safe to the end of the catheter and between interdwell distances. The method is feasible and accurate to implement on quality assurance tests and provides a unique database for efficient computational simulations of the transient dose.",cancer
"Shading correction for on-board cone-beam CT in radiation therapy using planning MDCT images. PURPOSE: Applications of cone-beam CT (CBCT) to image-guided radiationtherapy (IGRT) are hampered by shading artifacts in the reconstructed images. These artifacts are mainly due to scatter contamination in the projections but also can result from uncorrected beam hardening effects as well as nonlinearities in responses of the amorphous silicon flat panel detectors. While currently, CBCT is mainly used to provide patient geometry information for treatment setup, more demanding applications requiring high-quality CBCT images are under investigation. To tackle these challenges, many CBCT correction algorithms have been proposed; yet, a standard approach still remains unclear. In this work, we propose a shading correction method for CBCT that addresses artifacts from low-frequency projection errors. The method is consistent with the current workflow of radiation therapy. METHODS: With much smaller inherent scatter signals and more accurate detectors, diagnostic multidetector CT (MDCT) provides high quality CT images that are routinely used for radiation treatment planning. Using the MDCT image as ""free"" prior information, we first estimate the primary projections in the CBCT scan via forward projection of the spatially registered MDCT data. Since most of the CBCT shading artifacts stem from low-frequency errors in the projections such as scatter, these errors can be accurately estimated by low-pass filtering the difference between the estimated and raw CBCT projections. The error estimates are then subtracted from the raw CBCT projections. Our method is distinct from other published correction methods that use the MDCT image as a prior because it is projection-based and uses limited patient anatomical information from the MDCT image. The merit of CBCT-based treatment monitoring is therefore retained. RESULTS: The proposed method is evaluated using two phantom studies on tabletop systems. On the Catphan 600 phantom, our approach reduces the reconstruction error from 348 Hounsfield unit (HU) without correction to 4 HU around the object center after correction, and from 375 HU to 17 HU in the high-contrast regions. In the selected regions of interest (ROIs), the average image contrast is increased by a factor of 3.3. When noise suppression is implemented, the proposed correction substantially improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and therefore the visibility of low-contrast objects, as seen in a more challenging pelvis phantom study. Besides a significant improvement in image uniformity, a low-contrast object of approximately 25 HU, which is otherwise buried in the shading artifacts, can be clearly identified after the proposed correction due to a CNR increase of 3.1. Compared to a kernel-based scatter correction method coupled with an analytical beam hardening correction, our approach also shows an overall improved performance with some residual artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: By providing effective shading correction, our approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of more advanced CBCT-based clinical applications for IGRT, such as tumor delineation and dose calculation.",cancer
"Regularized antenna profile adaptation in online hyperthermia treatment. PURPOSE: Online optimization of annular-phased-array hyperthermia (HT) is based on planning tools and magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry. Until now, the method has been validated in phantoms. Further developments and extensions are required for clinical purposes. In particular, the problem of deducing the electric field distribution inside the patient from MR thermometry is ill-posed, which leads to an amplification of measurement errors. A method to overcome this difficulty is proposed. METHODS: The authors utilized a regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm with a fast bioheat transfer equation (BHTE) approximation to identify the field parameters. To evaluate the method, simulations with patient models are conducted and a treatment data set obtained from a heat treatment performed in the hybrid HT-MR system at the Charite Medical School is used to visualize the error amplification. RESULTS: The regularization leads to a significantly improved accuracy of the predicted electric fields and temperatures compared to an unregularized approach. The BHTE approximation enables highly accurate temperature predictions in real-time. CONCLUSIONS: Regularization proves to be necessary to identify electromagnetic field parameters. The proposed method is able to reproduce measurements without overfitting to the noise in the MR measurements and results in an improved treatment planning.",cancer
"Apparent absence of a proton beam dose rate effect and possible differences in RBE between Bragg peak and plateau. PURPOSE: Respiration-gated irradiation for a moving target requires a longer time to deliver single fraction in proton radiotherapy (PRT). Ultrahigh dose rate (UDR) proton beam, which is 10-100 times higher than that is used in current clinical practice, has been investigated to deliver daily dose in single breath hold duration. The purpose of this study is to investigate the survival curve and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of such an ultrahigh dose rate proton beam and their linear energy transfer (LET) dependence. METHODS: HSG cells were irradiated by a spatially and temporally uniform proton beam at two different dose rates: 8 Gy/min (CDR, clinical dose rate) and 325 Gy/min (UDR, ultrahigh dose rate) at the Bragg peak and 1.75 (CDR) and 114 Gy/min (UDR) at the plateau. To study LET dependence, the cells were positioned at the Bragg peak, where the absorbed dose-averaged LET was 3.19 keV/microm, and at the plateau, where it was 0.56 keV/microm. After the cell exposure and colony assay, the measured data were fitted by the linear quadratic (LQ) model and the survival curves and RBE at 10% survival were compared. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the survival curves between the two proton dose rates. The ratio of the RBE for CDR/UDR was 0.98 +/- 0.04 at the Bragg peak and 0.96 +/- 0.06 at the plateau. On the other hand, Bragg peak/plateau RBE ratio was 1.15 +/- 0.05 for UDR and 1.18 +/- 0.07 for CDR. CONCLUSIONS: Present RBE can be consistently used in treatment planning of PRT using ultrahigh dose rate radiation. Because a significant increase in RBE toward the Bragg peak was observed for both UDR and CDR, further evaluation of RBE enhancement toward the Bragg peak and beyond is required.",cancer
"Monte Carlo calculated TG-60 dosimetry parameters for the beta- emitter 153Sm brachytherapy source. PURPOSE: The formalism recommended by Task Group 60 (TG-60) of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) is applicable for beta sources. Radioactive biocompatible and biodegradable 153Sm glass seed without encapsulation is a beta- emitter radionuclide with a short half-life and delivers a high dose rate to the tumor in the millimeter range. This study presents the results of Monte Carlo calculations of the dosimetric parameters for the 153Sm brachytherapy source. METHODS: Version 5 of the (MCNP) Monte Carlo radiation transport code was used to calculate two-dimensional dose distributions around the source. The dosimetric parameters of AAPM TG-60 recommendations including the reference dose rate, the radial dose function, the anisotropy function, and the one-dimensional anisotropy function were obtained. RESULTS: The dose rate value at the reference point was estimated to be 9.21 +/- 0.6 cGy h(-1) microCi(-1). Due to the low energy beta emitted from 153Sm sources, the dose fall-off profile is sharper than the other beta emitter sources. The calculated dosimetric parameters in this study are compared to several beta and photon emitting seeds. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the advantage of the 153Sm source in comparison with the other sources because of the rapid dose fall-off of beta ray and high dose rate at the short distances of the seed. The results would be helpful in the development of the radioactive implants using 153Sm seeds for the brachytherapy treatment.",cancer
"A support vector machine (SVM) for predicting preferred treatment position in radiotherapy of patients with breast cancer. PURPOSE: NYU 05-181 protocol compared the CT simulation in both supine and prone positions for 400 patients with breast cancer (200 left-breast and 200 right-breast) to identify which setup is better at sparing heart and lung involvement in the treatment process. The results demonstrated that all right-breast patients benefited from the prone treatment position, while for left-breast patients, 85% were better treated prone and 15% were better treated supine. Using the clinical data collected from this protocol, the authors aimed at developing an automated tool capable of identifying which of the left-breast cancer patients are better treated supine without obtaining a second CT scan in the supine position. METHODS: Prone CT scans from 198 of the 200 left-breast cancer patients enrolled in NYU 05-181 protocol were deidentified and exported to a dedicated research planning workstation. Three-dimensional geometric features of the organs at risk and tumor bed were extracted. A two-stage classifier was used to classify patients into the prone class or the supine class. In the first stage, the authors use simple thresholding to divide the patients into two groups based on their in-field heart volume. For patients with in-field heart volume < or = 0.1 cc, the prone position was chosen as the preferred treatment position. Patients with in-field heart volume > 0.1 cc will be further classified in the second stage by a weighted support vector machine (SVM). The weight parameters of the SVM were adjusted to maximize the specificity [true-supine/(true-supine+false-prone)] at the cost of lowering but still maintaining reasonable sensitivity [true-prone/(true-prone+false-supine)]. The authors used K-fold cross validations to test the performance of the SVM classifier. A feature selection algorithm was also used to identify features that give the best classification performance. RESULTS: After the first stage, 49 of the 198 left-breast cancer patients were found to have > 0.1 cc of in-field heart volume. The three geometric features of heart orientation, distance between heart and tumor, and in-field lung were selected by the feature selection algorithm in the second stage of the two-stage classifier to give the best predefined weighted accuracy. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method were found to be 90.4% and 99.3%, respectively. Using two-stage classification, the authors reduced the proportion of prone-treated patients that need a second supine CT scan down to 16.3/170 or 9.6%, as compared to 21/170 or 12.4% when the authors use only the first stage (thresholding) for classification. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' study showed that a feature-based classifier is feasible for predicting the preferred treatment position, based on features extracted from prone CT scans. The two-stage classifier achieved very high specificity at an acceptable expense of sensitivity.",cancer
"Advanced treatment planning methods for efficient radiation therapy with laser accelerated proton and ion beams. PURPOSE: Laser plasma acceleration can potentially replace large and expensive cyclotrons or synchrotrons for radiotherapy with protons and ions. On the way toward a clinical implementation, various challenges such as the maximum obtainable energy still remain to be solved. In any case, laser accelerated particles exhibit differences compared to particles from conventional accelerators. They typically have a wide energy spread and the beam is extremely pulsed (i.e., quantized) due to the pulsed nature of the employed lasers. The energy spread leads to depth dose curves that do not show a pristine Bragg peak but a wide high dose area, making precise radiotherapy impossible without an additional energy selection system. Problems with the beam quantization include the limited repetition rate and the number of accelerated particles per laser shot. This number might be too low, which requires a high repetition rate, or it might be too high, which requires an additional fluence selection system to reduce the number of particles. Trying to use laser accelerated particles in a conventional way such as spot scanning leads to long treatment times and a high amount of secondary radiation produced when blocking unwanted particles. METHODS: The authors present methods of beam delivery and treatment planning that are specifically adapted to laser accelerated particles. In general, it is not necessary to fully utilize the energy selection system to create monoenergetic beams for the whole treatment plan. Instead, within wide parts of the target volume, beams with broader energy spectra can be used to simultaneously cover multiple axially adjacent spots of a conventional dose delivery grid as applied in intensity modulated particle therapy. If one laser shot produces too many particles, they can be distributed over a wider area with the help of a scattering foil and a multileaf collimator to cover multiple lateral spot positions at the same time. These methods are called axial and lateral clustering and reduce the number of particles that have to be blocked in the beam delivery system. Furthermore, the optimization routine can be adjusted to reduce the number of dose spots and laser shots. The authors implemented these methods into a research treatment planning system for laser accelerated particles. RESULTS: The authors' proposed methods can decrease the amount of secondary radiation produced when blocking particles with wrong energies or when reducing the total number of particles from one laser shot. Additionally, caused by the efficient use of the beam, the treatment time is reduced considerably. Both improvements can be achieved without extensively changing the quality of the treatment plan since conventional intensity modulated particle therapy usually includes a certain amount of unused degrees of freedom which can be used to adapt to laser specific properties. CONCLUSIONS: The advanced beam delivery and treatment planning methods reduce the need to have a perfect laser-based accelerator reproducing the properties of conventional accelerators that might not be possible without increasing treatment time and secondary radiation to the patient. The authors show how some of the differences to conventional beams can be overcome and efficiently used for radiation treatment.",cancer
"Clinical development of a failure detection-based online repositioning strategy for prostate IMRT--experiments, simulation, and dosimetry study. PURPOSE: To implement and evaluate clinic-ready adaptive imaging protocols for online patient repositioning (motion tracking) during prostate IMRT using treatment beam imaging supplemented by minimal, as-needed use of on-board kV. METHODS: The authors examine the two-step decision-making strategy: (1) Use cine-MV imaging and online-updated characterization of prostate motion to detect target motion that is potentially beyond a predefined threshold and (2) use paired MV-kV 3D localization to determine overthreshold displacement and, if needed, reposition the patient. Two levels of clinical implementation were evaluated: (1) Field-by-field based motion correction for present-day linacs and (2) instantaneous repositioning for new-generation linacs with capabilities of simultaneous MV-kV imaging and remote automatic couch control during treatment delivery. Experiments were performed on a Varian Trilogy linac in clinical mode using a 4D motion phantom programed with prostate motion trajectories taken from patient data. Dosimetric impact was examined using a 2D ion chamber array. Simulations were done for 536 trajectories from 17 patients. RESULTS: Despite the loss of marker detection efficiency caused by the MLC leaves sometimes obscuring the field at the marker's projected position on the MV imager, the field-by-field correction halved (from 23% to 10%) the mean percentage of time that target displacement exceeded a 3 mm threshold, as compared to no intervention. This was achieved at minimal cost in additional imaging (average of one MV-kV pair per two to three treatment fractions) and with a very small number of repositionings (once every four to five fractions). Also with low kV usage (approximation 2/fraction), the instantaneous repositioning approach reduced overthreshold time by more than 75% (23% to 5%) even with severe MLC blockage as often encountered in current IMRT and could reduce the overthreshold time tenfold (to < 2%) if the MLC blockage problem were relieved. The information acquired for repositioning using combined MV-kV images was found to have submillimeter accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrated with a current clinical setup that substantial reduction of adverse targeting effects of intrafraction prostate motion can be realized. The proposed adaptive imaging strategy incurs minimal imaging dose to the patient as compared to other stereoscopic imaging techniques.",cancer
"Modeling scatter-to-primary dose ratio for megavoltage photon beams. PURPOSE: A three-parameter semiempirical model for scatter-to-primary dose ratio (SPR) is proposed to fit PDD (or TPR) and S(p) beam data. The SPR formula proposed in this study is more accurate than the previously published formula utilizing two parameters, especially for lower energy megavoltage photon beams, because the effect of backscattered photons is now taken into account. METHODS: Monte Carlo (MC) calculated SPR for photon energy spectrum between 60Co and 24 MV are used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. Based on fitting the MC data, the dependence of the SPR parameters (a0, w0,d0) with the attenuation coefficients of the photon beams is obtained and they were incorporated into the authors' optimization routine. The ability of the optimization routine to fit measured clinic data is examined for photon energies ranging from 60Co to 25 MV for all major cobalt and linear accelerator manufacturers. RESULTS: The authors' model successfully fits the measured photon beam data for field size (E/3-40 cm), where E is photon energy in MV and for clinically usable depths, d(max) to 20 cm for 60Co, d(max) to 30 cm for 4 MV, and d(max) to 40 cm for 6 MV and higher photon energies. The maximum error among these fits is better than 2% for photon energies above 60Co. CONCLUSIONS: The new SPR formula, along with the optimization routine, can serve as an efficient tool for performing quality control of x-ray beam data that conforms to AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee TG40 and Therapy Physics Committee TG142 reports on beam data requirement.",cancer
"Cascaded analysis of signal and noise propagation through a heterogeneous breast model. PURPOSE: The detectability of lesions in radiographic images can be impaired by patterns caused by the surrounding anatomic structures. The presence of such patterns is often referred to as anatomic noise. Others have previously extended signal and noise propagation theory to include variable background structure as an additional noise term and used in simulations for analysis by human and ideal observers. Here, the analytic forms of the signal and noise transfer are derived to obtain an exact expression for any input random distribution and the ""power law"" filter used to generate the texture of the tissue distribution. METHODS: A cascaded analysis of propagation through a heterogeneous model is derived for x-ray projection through simulated heterogeneous backgrounds. This is achieved by considering transmission through the breast as a correlated amplification point process. The analytic forms of the cascaded analysis were compared to monoenergetic Monte Carlo simulations of x-ray propagation through power law structured backgrounds. RESULTS: As expected, it was found that although the quantum noise power component scales linearly with the x-ray signal, the anatomic noise will scale with the square of the x-ray signal. There was a good agreement between results obtained using analytic expressions for the noise power and those from Monte Carlo simulations for different background textures, random input functions, and x-ray fluence. CONCLUSIONS: Analytic equations for the signal and noise properties of heterogeneous backgrounds were derived. These may be used in direct analysis or as a tool to validate simulations in evaluating detectability.",cancer
"VMC++ validation for photon beams in the energy range of 20-1000 keV. PURPOSE: In high energy teletherapy, VMC++ is known to be a very accurate and efficient Monte Carlo (MC) code. In principle, the MC method is also a powerful dose calculation tool in other areas in radiation oncology, e.g., brachytherapy or orthovoltage radiotherapy. However, VMC++ is not validated for the low-energy range of such applications. This work aims in the validation of the VMC++ MC code for photon beams in the energy range between 20 and 1000 keV. METHODS: Dose calculations were performed in different 40 x 40 x 40 cm3 phantoms of different materials. Dose distributions of monoenergetic (ranging from 20 to 1000 keV) 10 x 10 and 2 x 2 cm2 parallel beams were calculated. Voxel sizes of 4 x 4 x 4 and 1 x 1 x 1 mm3 were used for the dose calculations. The resulting dose distributions were compared to those calculated using EGSnrc, which is used as a golden standard in this work. RESULTS: At energies between 100 and 1000 keV, EGSnrc and VMC++ calculated dose distributions agree within the statistical uncertainty of about 1% (1sigma). At energies < or = 50 keV, dose differences of up to 1.6% (in % of D(max)) occur when VMC++ and EGSnrc are compared. Turning off Rayleigh scattering, binding effects for Compton scattering, and the atomic relaxation after photoelectric absorption in EGSnrc (all not implemented in VMC++) leads to an agreement between both MC codes within statistical uncertainty. Further, using the KERMA approximation feature implemented in VMC++ leads to very efficient simulations in the energy range between 20 and 1000 keV. CONCLUSIONS: Further improvements for very low energies in accuracy of VMC++ could be achieved by implementing Rayleigh scattering, binding effects for Compton scattering, and the atomic relaxation after photoelectric absorption. Implementation into VMC++ of KERMA approximation has been validated.",cancer
"Fundus image fusion in EYEPLAN software: an evaluation of a novel technique for ocular melanoma radiation treatment planning. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel approach for treatment planning using digital fundus image fusion in EYEPLAN for proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) planning for ocular melanoma. The authors used a prototype version of EYEPLAN software, which allows for digital registration of high-resolution fundus photographs. The authors examined the improvement in tumor localization by replanning with the addition of fundus photo superimposition in patients with macular area tumors. METHODS: The new version of EYEPLAN (v3.05) software allows for the registration of fundus photographs as a background image. This is then used in conjunction with clinical examination, tantalum marker clips, surgeon's mapping, and ultrasound to draw the tumor contour accurately. In order to determine if the fundus image superimposition helps in tumor delineation and treatment planning, the authors identified 79 patients with choroidal melanoma in the macular location that were treated with PBRT. All patients were treated to a dose of 56 GyE in four fractions. The authors reviewed and replanned all 79 macular melanoma cases with superimposition of pretreatment and post-treatment fundus imaging in the new EYEPLAN software. For patients with no local failure, the authors analyzed whether fundus photograph fusion accurately depicted and confirmed tumor volumes as outlined in the original treatment plan. For patients with local failure, the authors determined whether the addition of the fundus photograph might have benefited in terms of more accurate tumor volume delineation. RESULTS: The mean follow-up of patients was 33.6 +/- 23 months. Tumor growth was seen in six eyes of the 79 macular lesions. All six patients were marginal failures or tumor miss in the region of dose fall-off, including one patient with both in-field recurrence as well as marginal. Among the six recurrences, three were managed by enucleation and one underwent retreatment with proton therapy. Three patients developed distant metastasis and all three patients have since died. The replanning of six patients with their original fundus photograph superimposed showed that in four cases, the treatment field adequately covered the tumor volume. In the other two patients, the overlaid fundus photographs indicated the area of marginal miss. The replanning with the fundus photograph showed improved tumor coverage in these two macular lesions. For the remaining patients without local failure, replanning with fundus photograph superimposition confirmed the tumor volume as drawn in the original treatment plan. CONCLUSIONS: Local control was excellent in patients receiving 56 GyE of PBRT for uveal melanomas in the macular region, which traditionally can be more difficult to control. Posterior lesions are better defined with the additional use of fundus image since they can be difficult to mark surgically. In one-third of treatment failing patients, the superposition of the fundus photograph would have clearly allowed improved localization of tumor. The current practice standard is to use the superimposition of the fundus photograph in addition to the surgeon's clinical and clip mapping of the tumor and ultrasound measurement to draw the tumor volume.",cancer
"Sensitivity of low energy brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition. PURPOSE: The objective of this work is to assess the sensitivity of Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition for a range of low photon energy brachytherapy sources: 125I, 103Pd, 131Cs, and an electronic brachytherapy source (EBS). The low energy photons emitted by these sources make the dosimetry sensitive to variations in tissue atomic number due to the dominance of the photoelectric effect. This work reports dose to a small mass of water in medium D(w,m) as opposed to dose to a small mass of medium in medium D(m,m). METHODS: Mean adipose, mammary gland, and breast tissues (as uniform mixture of the aforementioned tissues) are investigated as well as compositions corresponding to one standard deviation from the mean. Prostate mean compositions from three different literature sources are also investigated. Three sets of MC simulations are performed with the GEANT4 code: (1) Dose calculations for idealized TG-43-like spherical geometries using point sources. Radial dose profiles obtained in different media are compared to assess the influence of compositional uncertainties. (2) Dose calculations for four clinical prostate LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 125I seeds (Model 2301, Best Medical, Springfield, VA). The effect of varying the prostate composition in the planning target volume (PTV) is investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. (3) Dose calculations for four clinical breast LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 103Pd seeds (Model 2335, Best Medical). The effects of varying the adipose/gland ratio in the PTV and of varying the elemental composition of adipose and gland within one standard deviation of the assumed mean composition are investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. For (2) and (3), the influence of using the mass density from CT scans instead of unit mass density is also assessed. RESULTS: Results from simulation (1) show that variations in the mean compositions of tissues affect low energy brachytherapy dosimetry. Dose differences between mean and one standard deviation of the mean composition increasing with distance from the source are observed. It is established that the 125I and 131Cs sources are the least sensitive to variations in elemental compositions while 103Pd is most sensitive. The EBS falls in between and exhibits complex behavior due to significant spectral hardening. Results from simulation (2) show that two prostate compositions are dosimetrically equivalent to water while the third shows D90 differences of up to 4%. Results from simulation (3) show that breast is more sensitive than prostate with dose variations of up to 30% from water for 70% adipose/30% gland breast. The variability of the breast composition adds a +/- 10% dose variation. CONCLUSIONS: Low energy brachytherapy dose distributions in tissue differ from water and are influenced by density, mean tissue composition, and patient-to-patient composition variations. The results support the use of a dose calculation algorithm accounting for heterogeneities such as MC. Since this work shows that variations in mean tissue compositions affect MC dosimetry and result in increased dose uncertainties, the authors conclude that imaging tools providing more accurate estimates of elemental compositions such as dual energy CT would be beneficial.",cancer
"Respiratory distress in newborn: evaluation of chest X-rays. We discuss the anatomic and pathophysiological patterns of preterm and term newborn. Particular attention is directed to technical artefacts relating to the interpretation of chest radiography.

"The efficacy of chemical adjuvants on giant-cell tumour of bone. An in vitro study. Various chemicals are commonly used as adjuvant treatment to surgery for giant-cell tumour (GCT) of bone. The comparative effect of these solutions on the cells of GCT is not known. In this study we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of sterile water, 95% ethanol, 5% phenol, 3% hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and 50% zinc chloride (ZnCI(2)) on GCT monolayer tumour cultures which were established from six patients. The DNA content, the metabolic activity and the viability of the cultured samples of tumour cells were assessed at various times up to 120 hours after their exposure to these solutions. Equal cytotoxicity to the GCT monolayer culture was observed for 95% ethanol, 5% phenol, 3% H(2)O(2) and 50% ZnCI(2). The treated samples showed significant reductions in DNA content and metabolic activity 24 hours after treatment and this was sustained for up to 120 hours. The samples treated with sterile water showed an initial decline in DNA content and viability 24 hours after treatment, but the surviving cells were viable and had proliferated. No multinucleated cell formation was seen in these cultures. These results suggest that the use of chemical adjuvants other than water could help improve local control in the treatment of GCT of bone.",cancer
"Does the southern European cardiovascular mortality advantage extend to total mortality? 50-year trends in death risks between 40 and 70 years of age in Western European men and women. AIMS: To study 50-year mortality trends in men and women of northern and southern Western Europe. METHODS: The World Health Organization mortality data base and multiple decrement life table methods was used to compute all-cause and cause-specific risks of middle-age death (40-69 years of age) for northern (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and UK) and southern (France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland) Western European countries. RESULTS: From 1952 to 2001, the risk of a cardiovascular death in middle age was higher in the north compared to the south. The north/ south cardiovascular mortality ratios (MR) peaked in 1990-1993 and were 1.57 among women and 1.47 among men in 2001. In 1952, the all-cause risks of middle-age death were similar in the north and south for both women and men (39% and 27%, respectively). In 2001, middle-age death risks were similar for men in the north and the south (24% and 23%, MR = 1.05), but higher among women in the north compared to the south (14% and 11%, MR = 1.28). Cause-specific death risks demonstrated that the cardiovascular advantage for southern European men was countered by a disadvantage in cancer death risk (2001 north/south cancer MR = 0.85). For northern European women in 2001, there was a disadvantage also in the other major cause-of-death groups: cancer (MR = 1.22) and other diseases (MR = 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: The southern European cardiovascular middle-age mortality advantage extended to total mortality much more for women than for men. We suggest that forces behind this gender difference in this north/south mortality gradient include life style factors.",cancer
"Reassessing the standard of care in indolent lymphoma: a clinical update to improve clinical practice. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) represents a diverse group of hematologic malignancies originating in B or T lymphocytes. Approximately 85% of NHLs are of B-cell origin, with the remainder mostly of T-cell origin. The most common NHL types are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (31%) and follicular lymphoma (22%). More than 65,000 new cases of NHL develop each year, and approximately 20,000 people with NHL died of the disease 2009. NHL is the seventh most common cancer in the United States, contributes to approximately 4% to 5% of all cancer cases in the United States, and causes approximately 3% of all cancer-related deaths. Currently, nearly 500,000 people are living with the disease or are in remission. Several new and encouraging advances have been made in the treatment of indolent NHL. Although the watch and wait approach still has a role, combined immunochemotherapy remains the standard of care for both first-line and relapsed/refractory disease. As front-line treatment, bendamustine plus rituximab may become a new standard of care, especially for older patients. In contrast, rituximab in combination with chemotherapy followed by rituximab maintenance seems to be the optimal option in patients with relapsed disease.",cancer
"Preliminary report: the development of the NCCN Comparative Therapeutic Index as a clinical evaluative process for existing data in oncology. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) develops and communicates the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) to oncologists and other clinicians. The NCCN Guidelines are widely recognized and applied as the standard for clinical policy in the United States. These guidelines and related documents, such as the NCCN Drugs & Biologics Compendium (NCCN Compendium), are used extensively by public and private payors as the basis for the setting of coverage policies. Given the demand for comparative effectiveness (CE) analyses, as described and discussed in this report, the NCCN has begun work on a paradigm to integrate evidence-based CE analysis into the NCCN Guidelines deliberative process. This report presents NCCN's initial thinking on the use of NCCN expert panel members in developing a process that can be used to compare health care technologies (e.g., radiation modalities, chemotherapy regimens) in a formal, systematic way. Draft considerations are provided to stimulate discussion and feedback, particularly in the oncology community, as NCCN moves through processes such as methodologic review, validation of rating scales, and review of implications for public policy, toward finalization of an NCCN CE analytic paradigm.",cancer

"Development and assessment of a physical activity guidebook for the Colon Health and Life-Long Exercise Change (CHALLENGE) trial (NCIC CO.21). BACKGROUND: We report the development and assessment of a physical activity (PA) guidebook called Step Up to the Challenge that is being used to support a PA behavior change intervention in a randomized trial examining PA and disease-free survival in colon cancer survivors. METHODS: Content for the PA guidebook was constructed based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Expert judges (N = 51) included oncologists, rehabilitation practitioners, colon cancer survivors, and TPB researchers. All expert judges completed the Maine Area Health Education Center checklist for evaluating written health information. A subset of TPB expert judges (n = 11) also assessed the degree of match between the guidebook content and TPB constructs. RESULTS: Expert judges indicated that the PA guidebook achieved desirable attributes for organization, writing style, appearance, appeal, feasibility, and appropriateness. For the TPB assessment, all mean item-content relevance ratings indicated at least a ""very good match"" between the PA guidebook content and the TPB constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Our guidebook successfully targets the TPB constructs known to influence PA behavior change and contains suitable and appropriate written health information. This guidebook will be an integral component of the behavioral support program designed to determine the effects of PA on disease-free survival in colon cancer survivors.",cancer
"An acute exercise session increases self-efficacy in sedentary endometrial cancer survivors and controls. BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy can be affected by mastery experiences and somatic sensations. A novel exercise experience and associated sensations may impact self-efficacy and subsequent behaviors. We investigated the effect of a single exercise session on self-efficacy for sedentary endometrial cancer survivors compared with sedentary women of a similar age, but with no cancer history. METHODS: Twenty survivors and 19 controls completed an exercise session performed as a submaximal cycle ergometry test. Sensations and efficacy were measured before and after exercise. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Regression models were used to determine predictors of self-efficacy and subsequent exercise. RESULTS: Self-efficacy increased for both survivors and controls, but survivors had a higher rate of increase, and the change predicted subsequent exercise. The association between exercise-related somatic sensations and self-efficacy differed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: A novel exercise experience had a larger effect on self-efficacy and subsequent exercise activity for endometrial cancer survivors than controls. Somatic sensations experienced during exercise may differ for survivors, which may be related to the experience of having cancer. Understanding factors affecting confidence in novel exercise experiences for populations with specific cancer histories is of the utmost importance in the adoption of exercise behaviors.",cancer
"Necessity of bilateral bone marrow biopsies for ancillary cytogenetic studies in the pediatric population. The need for bilateral pediatric bone marrow biopsies for cytogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies has not been clearly delineated. We retrospectively identified 166 pediatric bilateral bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained from patients with a variety of clinical diagnoses, including solid tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, and other hematologic conditions. The cases included all pediatric bilateral bone marrow biopsies performed at our hospital spanning the years of 1992 to 2008. Agreement of FISH and classical cytogenetic results between the 2 sides was assessed. Of a total of 166 bilateral cases, 2 cases showed disagreement (1.2%), both from patients with solid tumors. One case was a rhabdomyosarcoma, in which FISH only was performed; the second was a neuroblastoma in which FISH and cytogenetics were performed (both FISH and classical cytogenetic results disagreed). The remainder of the cases showed complete agreement between the 2 sides (total 98.8%). We conclude that it is usually not necessary to perform bilateral bone marrow biopsies for FISH and cytogenetics in the pediatric population outside of the setting of solid tumor staging.",cancer
"Transformation of follicular lymphoma to plasmablastic lymphoma with c-myc gene rearrangement. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent lymphoma that transforms to high-grade lymphoma, mostly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in about a third of patients. We present the first report of a case of FL that transformed to plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). Clonal transformation of the FL to PBL was evidenced by identical IGH/BCL2 gene rearrangements and VDJ gene usage in rearranged IGH genes. IGH/ BCL2 translocation was retained in the PBL, which also acquired c-myc gene rearrangement. Genealogic analysis based on somatic hypermutation of the rearranged IGH genes of both FL and PBL suggests that transformation of the FL to PBL occurred most likely by divergent evolution from a common progenitor cell rather than direct evolution from the FL clone. Our study of this unusual case expands the histologic spectrum of FL transformation and increases our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of transformation of indolent lymphomas to aggressive lymphomas.",cancer
"Aspiration cytomorphology of fetal adenocarcinoma of the lung. Fetal adenocarcinoma (FA) of the lung is an exceedingly rare malignancy. Many patients with the well-differentiated form are relatively young and with the high-grade variant are older. We describe the cases of 4 women with FA examined by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Aspirates were moderately cellular with malignant, mostly aggregated cells. Glands and acini were present. The columnar neoplastic epithelial cells had homogeneous round nuclei with fine chromatin, smooth membranes, and indistinct nucleoli. With the rapid Romanowsky stain, subnuclear vacuoles were evident in some tumor cells; at times, this was associated with a focal extracellular tigroid pattern. Morule formation was present in the 3 specimens. Immunochemically, all tumors manifested epithelial and neuroendocrine differentiation. Cytomorphologic attributes included the following: (1) distinct subnuclear vacuoles, sometimes with an associated tigroid picture; (2) small, uniform, round nuclei; (3) morules; and (4) neuroendocrine differentiation in glandular epithelial cells.",cancer
"Lack of HER2 overexpression and amplification in small intestinal adenocarcinoma. HER2 overexpression and amplification have been studied as a therapeutic and prognostic target in a number of human cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal adenocarcinomas. However, HER2 status has not been well investigated in primary small intestinal adenocarcinoma, probably because of its rarity. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER2 on 49 primary nonampullar small intestinal adenocarcinomas. The results showed a complete lack of HER2 protein expression in 47 cases (96%) by immunohistochemical analysis. Only 2 cases (4%) showed a 1+ staining pattern. No tumors exhibited 2+ or 3+ HER2 immunoreactivity. By FISH, none of the tumors, including those with 1+ HER2 immunoreactivity, exhibited HER2 gene amplification. These observations demonstrate that HER2 protein overexpression and gene amplification are infrequent events, if they occur at all, in small intestinal adenocarcinoma. Thus, routine immunohistochemical and/or FISH testing for HER2 for potential targeted anti-HER2 therapy may not be beneficial for patients with primary small intestinal adenocarcinoma.",cancer
"Molecular and immunohistologic analyses cannot reliably solve diagnostic variation of flat intraepithelial lesions of the urinary bladder. We examined diagnostic variation of flat intraurothelial lesions with comparison with immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. Nine uropathologists diagnosed 23 biopsy samples from the urinary bladder. The samples were analyzed by immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 20, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin, Ki-67, p53, and p16(INK4a), and multicolor FISH using the UroVysion probe set (Vysis, Abbott, Des Plaines, IL). Diagnostic agreement for each classification and for nonneoplastic or neoplastic lesions was obtained in 8 (35%) and 16 (70%) of 23 lesions, respectively. The preference ratio of neoplasia to nonneoplasia (0.9 to 4.8) or carcinoma in situ to dysplasia (0.2 to 4.0) also varied among the pathologists. In 6 ancillary analyses, the majority of neoplastic lesions with diagnostic agreement indicated more than 2 aberrant results, whereas the majority of lesions without diagnostic agreement showed no or only 1 aberrant result. The molecular and immunohistochemical analyses can discriminate between neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions; however, they cannot reliably solve diagnostic variation of flat intraepithelial lesions.",cancer
"Neurological complications of systemic cancer. Neurological complications of systemic cancer-those arising outside the nervous system-can be distressing, disabling, and sometimes fatal. Diagnosis is often difficult because different neurological disorders may present with similar signs and symptoms. Furthermore, comorbid neurological illnesses, common in elderly patients with cancer, can complicate diagnosis. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can improve neurological symptoms and can substantially enhance a patient's quality of life. We approach the problem of neurological complications of systemic cancer as would a neurologist: first by identifying the anatomical area or areas that are affected (ie, brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve), then by evaluating the diagnostic approach, considering the symptoms and signs and including appropriate laboratory tests, and finally, by recommending treatment. We focus on disorders that are difficult to diagnose, need neurological consultation, and for which effective treatments exist.",cancer
"Minimally invasive diagnosis of sarcoidosis by EBUS when conventional diagnostics fail. BACKGROUND: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine-needle aspiration (EBUS) is a minimally invasive method used routinely for mediastinal staging of patients with lung cancer. EBUS has also proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with different intrathoracic lesions who remain undiagnosed despite bronchoscopy and CT-guided fine-needle aspiration. OBJECTIVE: The present study focused on EBUS for diagnosing sarcoidosis. DESIGN: During a 3-year period 308 of 601 patients who underwent EBUS at our institution were referred for further diagnostic of a radiologically suspicious lesion in the lung parenchyma (n = 195), enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum (n = 89), a suspicious tumor in the mediastinum or pleural disease (n = 24) but no one had a definite histological diagnosis. All charts were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 308 patients 43 (14%) were eventually diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Thirty-three (77%) were diagnosed with EBUS. In the remaining 10 patients EBUS did not provide adequate tissue samples in 4 (9%) and in 6 patients (14%) EBUS provided adequate tissue but no definite diagnosis. EBUS was significantly better to establish the diagnosis in patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes compared with isolated lung parenchymal involvement (85% vs 63%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: EBUS is a valuable minimally invasive diagnostic modality to establish the diagnosis of sarcoidosis of unselected patients with undiagnosed intrathoracic lesions after conventional work up--particularly if patients have enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. This minimally invasive procedure provides a final diagnosis without exposing the patient to the risk of complications from more invasive procedures.",cancer
"Preventing and managing vesicant chemotherapy extravasations. Although vesicant chemotherapy extravasations cannot be entirely prevented, the risk of extravasation can be reduced by adhering to guidelines for safe vesicant administration. These include engaging patients in extravasation-prevention efforts, thoroughly assessing patients receiving vesicants, selecting an appropriate administration site for peripheral vesicant administration, and checking for a blood return prior to and during vesicant administration. In addition, whenever an extravasation occurs or is suspected, vesicant administration must immediately cease, and the appropriate antidote or treatment needs to be promptly administered.",cancer
"Longitudinal effects of social support and adaptive coping on the emotional well-being of survivors of localized prostate cancer. Survivors of prostate cancer experience treatment-related physical side effects that can compromise emotional well-being for years post-treatment. There is limited research investigating how social support and the use of coping may affect the emotional well-being of this population following treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate how social support and coping impact emotional well-being 2 years after treatment in survivors of localized prostate cancer who have received either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Psychosocial and disease-specific measures were administered to an ethnically and demographically diverse sample of 180 men treated for localized prostate cancer at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. Regression analyses demonstrated that higher levels of social support at baseline predicted better emotional well-being 2 years later. Furthermore, higher levels of adaptive coping at baseline partially mediated the relationship between social support and emotional well-being. Supportive relationships may contribute to improved emotional well-being following treatment by facilitating the use of adaptive coping strategies. Attention should be given to strengthening social support networks and educating survivors of prostate cancer on adaptive coping techniques.",cancer
"Obtaining data on comorbid diabetes among patients in a U.S. population-based tumor registry. Comorbid diabetes mellitus has been shown to be associated with outcomes among cancer patients, but population-based data have been limited to elderly patients through linkages between the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database and Medicare databases. Reporting of comorbidity to the population-based Connecticut SEER registry is not required, but the extent of voluntary reporting of comorbid diabetes was assessed in this preliminary study. Of 15,145 Connecticut residents diagnosed at age 20+ years with invasive cancer in 2006, who were ascertained from 33 registry sources, 8688 (57.4%) from 21 sources were included in the analysis of comorbid diabetes. The prevalence of comorbid diabetes was 12.5%, and was lowest for patients with prostate cancer (8.5%) and highest for with liver-pancreas cancer (25.9%), consistent with the literature. Diabetes prevalence was substantial (9.5%) within the non-elderly subgroup aged 20-64 years at cancer diagnosis who comprised 45% of the 8688 patients. These results indicate an opportunity for future large-scale studies of the impact of diabetes on outcomes among all newly diagnosed cancer patients (both non-elderly and elderly) in the Connecticut SEER registry and other US central cancer registries.",cancer
"Improving geocoding outcomes for the Nebraska Cancer Registry: learning from proven practices. This report summarizes geocoding improvement experiments in the Nebraska Cancer Registry. An initial assessment of previous geocoding suggests that some proven geocoding procedures have not been followed, and overall results were unacceptable. This study concluded that when updating different address files from different time periods, it is sufficient to use the most recent street centerline database. The combination of match score of 80 and spelling sensitivity of 80 in ESRI's ArcGIS geocoder is sufficient for most geocoding purposes. Given the sizable number of unmatched addresses, the Google Maps geocoding service was used. A comparison of 1500 high-quality addresses that were matched by both Google Maps and ArcGIS geocoders shows that, in most cases, the location discrepancies between the two were acceptable. The median distance between each pair of 1500 coded locations was 36.6 meters, with an average of 92.8 meters. Distance discrepancies were larger in urban fringe areas and smaller toward urban centers. It was concluded that by strictly following proven procedures including address coding specification, Internet-based White Pages for reverse address finding, and Internet-based geocoding, a 90% or even a 95% match rate is achievable.",cancer
"The relationship between methylation of the Syk gene in the promoter region and the genesis of lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To study the expression of the Syk (Spleen Tyrosine Kinase) gene and methylation in its promoter region in lung cancer. To investigate the relationship between silencing of the Syk gene and DNA methylation of the Syk promoter region. METHODS: RT-PCR (Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR), Real-time PCR (Real-time quantitative PCR) and immunohistochemistry technique, the expression of Syk in specimens from 3 lung cancer cell lines and 16 lung cancer patients (tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues). MSP (Methylation-specific PCR) was used to analyze the methylation status of the Syk promoter region. Then we also investigated the role of restoring Syk expression by using a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-CdR (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), in suppressing invasion of lung cell lines. RESULTS: No expression of the Syk gene was detected in the 3 lung cancer cell lines. In the 16 lung patient samples, Syk expression was significantly lower in the tumor tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.05). Consistently, immunohistochemistry analyses of Syk protein expression showed that in the cancer tissues Syk protein expression accounted for 5% (1/20), and in the adjacent normal tissues the rate of expression was 100% (20/20). The correlation was highly significant (chi2 = 36.19, P < 0.005). In the only case that showed a positive expression of cancer textus, the level was inferior to the adjacent tissue. In the two lung cancer cell lines (L9981, A549) that lack the endogenous Syk epression, 4uM demethylation agent 5-aza-CdR treatment was able to reactivate the Syk gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation leads to silencing of the Syk gene in human lung carcinoma. Methylation of the Syk promoter and loss of Syk expression in lung cancer are independent biomarkers, a determination which may offer guidance for selecting appropriate diagnoses and treatments. Syk may be a potential tumor suppressor in human lung cancer.",cancer
"Hemoperitoneum caused by a bleeding myoma in pregnancy. The prevalence of uterine myomas during pregnancy is estimated to range from 0.3% to 2.6%. Although leiomyomas usually remain asymptomatic, in one often cases they may be complicated. The management of uterine fibroids during pregnancy is largely conservative and surgical removal is generally delayed until post partum. A 37-year-old pregnant woman (15 weeks) with a history of gynecologic examination several hours before presented with lower abdominal pain and signs of acute abdomen. She was para-2, as she had delivered a healthy child 12 years before, and current pregnancy was uncomplicated until presentation. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage was suspected and she underwent immediate exploratory laparotomy, which revealed massive hemoperitoneum. A subserous uterine leiomyoma of 8.5x6.5 cm was found in the fundus area, with an actively bleeding ruptured vessel on its dome. Myomectomy was successfully performed and 1.5 liter of blood and blood clots were evacuated from the peritoneal cavity. The histology report showed sections of interlacing bundles of smooth muscles with areas of bleeding and necrotic degeneration. The postoperative course and subsequent antenatal period were uneventful. The woman went into spontaneous labor at 38 weeks and delivered vaginally a healthy male baby. This rare case ofintra-abdominal hemorrhage due to bleeding myoma supports other recent studies, which have demonstrated that myomectomy may be successfully performed during pregnancy in selected circumstances.",cancer
"Synchronous rectal adenocarcinoma and bilateral clear cell renal carcinoma. A 69-year-old man was admitted for resection of rectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed by colonoscopy. Preoperative computed tomography scan and abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilateral renal tumors measuring up to 2 and 2.8 cm in largest diameter, respectively. The patient underwent partial colectomy and bilateral partial nephrectomy. Microscopically, rectal adenocarcinoma penetrated the submucosa, without invasion of the muscularis propria. Both renal tumors were clear cell renal carcinomas of Fuhrmann nuclear grade 2. To our knowledge, this is the first case of synchronous adenocarcinoma of the rectum and bilateral clear cell renal cell carcinoma described in the literature to date.",cancer
"Increases in quantitative D-dimer levels correlate with progressive disease better than circulating tumor cell counts in patients with refractory prostate cancer. Changes in quantitative D-dimer levels, circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were measured in 28 patients with refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer to assess their concordance during the course of therapy and their relationship with risk of progressive disease. A significant correlation was identified between changes in PSA and both CTC counts and D-dimer levels (r = 0.67 and 0.58, respectively; P < .001). In addition, there was a significant correlation between changes in CTC count and D-dimer level (r = 0.62; P < .001). A significantly stronger concordance between these biomarkers was noted for increasing values (sensitivity, 72%-77.8%) compared with decreasing values (specificity, 43.8%-71.4%). Notably, increases in PSA and D-dimer levels, not CTC counts, were associated with increased risks for progressive disease (P < .024). Increases in quantitative D-dimer levels correlate with progressive disease better than CTC counts in patients with refractory prostate cancer.",cancer
"A new approach for identifying patients with ovarian epithelial neoplasms based on high-resolution mass spectrometry. We investigated the serum profiles of patients with ovarian neoplasm using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to obtain serum ""fingerprints"" for use in identifying patients with these neoplasms. We used HPLC-HRMS to analyze serum samples from patients with ovarian neoplasms and control subjects. Serum samples from 145 patients were analyzed, including 85 with ovarian epithelial neoplasms. We also compared the results of this serum-fingerprinting approach with the results of the CA-125 test and imaging. Fingerprinting successfully permitted the separation of control patients and patients with ovarian neoplasms. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were between 96% and 100%. When the results of this test were concordant with the results of the CA-125 test, 99% of serum samples were correctly classified as being from a patient with an ovarian neoplasm or with no ovarian neoplasm. We found that a metabolite of molecular weight 472 is the main metabolite in the separation of patients with ovarian neoplasms from control subjects.

We evaluated its immunohistochemical expression in 317 primary and 42 metastatic renal neoplasms (186 clear cell, 52 papillary, 35 chromophobe, 47 unclassified, and 15 Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinomas [RCCs]; 26 oncocytomas; 2 metanephric adenomas; 1 urothelial carcinoma; 1 mixed epithelial and stromal tumor; and 1 angiomyolipoma); 7 neoplasms were unknown as to whether they were primary or metastatic. We also correlated expression with tumor type and grade. Variable staining was seen in clear cell, papillary, unclassified, and Xp11.2 translocation carcinomas. One chromophobe carcinoma had focal expression. No staining was seen with other tumors. An association was found between high expression and clear cell vs non-clear cell carcinomas with all cases (P < .01) and primary (P < .01) cases. An association between CAIX expression and grade (P < .01) in primary clear cell carcinomas was found. CAIX expression is more common in clear cell RCC than other renal tumor types and is associated with grade.",cancer
"Dimensional versus categorical use of the PHQ-9 depression scale among persons with non-small-cell lung cancer: a pilot study including quality-of-life comparisons. The debate over the relative usefulness of categorical (yes/no) versus dimensional (continuous scales) assessments for determining mental illness has been running strong for nearly a half century. In order to address the utility of each of these assessment methods within the cancer population, in the present study, the dimensional and categorical scoring systems of the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression were compared among patients (n = 14) in the pretreatment stages for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Also included in the study was an additional dimensional measure of depression, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). As predicted, dimensional assessments resulted in higher estimates of depression than did the categorical assessment. As predicted, the dimensional depression assessments, including the PHQ-9 and the BDI-II, which showed depression prevalence rates of 43% and 36%, respectively, produced higher estimates of depression than did the categorical system of the PHQ-9, whose use did not result in any patients being diagnosed with major depression or other depression. Also, as predicted, in terms of quality of life, patients found to be depressed by both the BDI-II and the dimensional PHQ-9 reported significantly worse physical, functional, and emotional well-being than did their nondepressed counterparts. Study findings suggest a need for further investigation into the possibility that patients who score highly on the dimensional scoring system of the PHQ-9 but at values below threshold on the more commonly accepted categorical scoring system of the same measure would benefit from consideration for psychotherapeutic treatment.",cancer
"A prospective crossover pilot study to evaluate the use of a topical wound gel in patients with cutaneous toxicity caused by epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. One of the dose-limiting toxicities of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) is a papulopustular rash that is often pruritic and painful. Secondary skin infection can occur from scratching to relieve the pruritus. Studies suggest that this rash might be a surrogate marker for efficacy; therefore, effective rash management is needed to allow patients to use EGFRIs without unnecessary dose modifications. In this single-center, prospective, crossover study, we evaluated the use of a topical gel (Regenecare Wound Gel) for relieving the pruritus and pain of EGFRI-induced rash among oncology patients. The secondary end points were patient satisfaction, adverse effects, and EGFRI dose modifications. At the occurrence of grade 2 skin rash, patients started applying the study gel to the right side of their face; after 1 week, they began applying it to both sides of their face for up to an additional 5 weeks. Each week, providers performed a facial evaluation and patients rated their symptoms and satisfaction on questionnaires. Of the 20 patients enrolled, 13 were evaluable. Reduction in itch at the end of week 1 was greater on the right (treated) side in 69% of patients greater on the left (untreated) side in 8%, and the same in 23% (P = 0.01). The pattern was similar for pain, but the differences were not significant. On average, patients rated the gel as being moderately to extremely effective for alleviating symptoms, improving rash appearance, and promoting healing and found it easy to apply. No adverse effects were documented. Four patients (31%) required EGFRI dose modifications because of rash. Taken together, these findings suggest that the topical wound gel is effective in relieving rash-associated itching in patients receiving EGFRIs and is associated with high patient satisfaction.",cancer
"Including self-reported race to improve cancer surveillance data for American Indians and Alaska Natives in Washington state. BACKGROUND: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are frequently misclassified as another race in cancer surveillance systems, resulting in underestimated morbidity and mortality. Linkage methods with administrative records have been used to correct AI/AN misclassification, but AI/AN populations living in urban areas, and those who self-identify as AI/AN race, continue to be under-ascertained. The aim of this study was to evaluate racial misclassification in two cancer registries in Washington State using an urban AI/AN patient roster linked with a list of Indian Health Service (IHS) enrollees. METHODS: We conducted probabilistic record linkages to identify racial misclassification using a combined demographic dataset of self-identified AI/AN patients of a large, urban Indian health center, and administratively-identified AI/AN enrolled with the IHS. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated for 3 linkage populations: AI/ AN originally coded in each cancer registry, post-linkage AI/AN identified through the IHS roster alone, and post-linkage AI/AN identified through either the urban or IHS file. RESULTS: In the state and regional cancer registries, 11% and 18%, respectively, of matched cases were originally coded as a race other than AI/AN; approximately 35% of these were identified by the urban file alone. Incidence rate estimates increased after linkage with the IHS file, and further increased with the addition of urban records. Matches identified by the urban patient file resulted in the largest relative incidence change being demonstrated for King County (which includes Seattle); the all-site invasive cancer rate increased 8.8%, from 443 to 482 per 100,000. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of urban and self-identified AI/AN records can increase case ascertainment in cancer surveillance systems beyond linkage methods using only administrative sources.",cancer
"A case of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder: immunohistochemistry and differential diagnosis. The morphological spectrum of gallbladder carcinoma is broad and variable. Most of these tumors are tubular adenocarcinomas. There are some tumors with unusual morphology that may be difficult to classify due to their rarity. One of such tumors is the signet-ring cell carcinoma, which is a highly aggressive, mucin producing variant of gallbladder adenocarcinoma predominantly or exclusively composed of signet-ring cells. Histologically, these tumors are similar to their counterparts in other organs such as stomach, colon and breast, and should not be misinterpreted as metastatic carcinoma from one of these primary sites. The literature about this variant of carcinoma is sparse and little is known about it. We found only three cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder previously reported. We present the case of an 86-year-old woman with signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder and discuss the potential diagnostic dilemmas",cancer
"Brain tumors and epilepsy. Brain tumors are a common cause of epilepsy. Tumor type and location are determining factors that significantly influence seizure frequency. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical data of patients diagnosed with brain tumors and epilepsy. Data for this study were obtained from patient medical records over a 6-year period (2000-2005). Patient history and findings obtained by diagnostic methods such as electroencephalography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance were analyzed. Data were analyzed by appropriate statistical methods and the structure, prevalence, mean and standard deviation were calculated. The significance of results was tested by use of t-test and chi2-test. A total of 15 933 patient charts were analyzed. Out of 15 933 patients, 10.8% were diagnosed with epilepsy and 175 (1.09%) patients had brain tumor, 75 (42.86%) of which were significantly associated with epilepsy (P > 0.05). Almost forty-three percent (42.86%) of tumors were epileptogenic, with no significant sex difference (confidence level of 95%). Fifty-seven (32.5%) brain tumor patients were aged 51-60. The mean age of all patients with brain tumors was 41.6 years. Focal sensorimotor seizures were dominant in 40 (53.3%) cases. Among epilepsy cases with known etiology, 75 (6.8%) patients had epileptogenic tumors. Types of seizures in patients with epilepsy were different from seizures provoked by brain tumors. The most common tumor site was temporal region (43.4%). There was no significant difference according to epileptogenesis. Focal sensorimotor seizures were common in patients with frontal and parietal region tumors.",cancer
"Diverse phenotypic profile of uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors: an immunohistochemical study of 12 cases. BACKGROUND: Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors (UTROSCTs) are rare neoplasms thought to be of putative endometrial stromal origin and solely composed of sex cord elements. Our study aimed to delineate the immunophenotype of these tumors and to verify whether their morphology reflects true sex cord-like differentiation. DESIGN: Representative paraffin blocks from 12 UTROSCTs were selected after confirmation of the diagnosis. Cords and/or trabeculae were seen in all tumors, whereas tubules, diffuse areas, and a retiform pattern were present in 9, 6, and 2 cases, respectively. Tumors were stained for sex cord (inhibin, calretinin, WT1, and melan-A), epithelial (KL1 and epithelial membrane antigen), and smooth muscle markers (smooth muscle actin, desmin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, h-caldesmon, and histone deacetylase-8), CD10, HMB45, S100, and CD117. Intensity and percentage of staining were recorded. RESULTS: Six out of 12 tumors were positive for sex cord markers (inhibin 3 of 12, calretinin 4 of 12, WT1 4 of 12, and melan-A 3 of 11) with 4 tumors coexpressing more than one marker. Half of the UTROSCTs showed positivity for KL1, with 2 tumors coexpressing epithelial membrane antigen. All but one tumor expressed one or more smooth muscle markers, with smooth muscle actin, desmin and histone deacetylase-8 being most commonly expressed. CD10 was positive in 6 of 12 tumors, CD117 in 4 of 12, and S100 in 2 of 11 tumors, whereas HMB45 was negative in 11 tumors tested. CONCLUSIONS: UTROSCTs have a diverse immunohistochemical profile often coexpressing sex cord, epithelial, and smooth muscle markers. The expression of smooth muscle markers in these tumors does not imply a smooth muscle origin as endometrial and sex cord stromal tumors are not infrequently positive for these markers. Positivity for sex cord markers supports a true sex cord/steroid phenotype. Although the immunohistochemical profile of these tumors overlaps with that of endometrial stromal tumors with sex cord-like differentiation as well as ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, the origin of UTROSCT remains uncertain.",cancer
"Intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasm (IAPN): characterization of tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia occurring within the ampulla: a clinicopathologic analysis of 82 cases. BACKGROUND: There has been no uniform terminology for systematic analysis of mass-forming preinvasive neoplasms (which we term tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia) that occur specifically within the ampulla. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of these neoplasms, which we propose to refer to as intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasm (IAPN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and seventeen glandular neoplasms involving the ampulla were identified through a review of 1469 pancreatoduodenectomies and 11 ampullectomies. Eighty-two neoplasms characterized by substantial preinvasive exophytic component that grew almost exclusively (>75%) within the ampulla (in the ampullary channel or intra-ampullary portions of the very distal segments of the common bile duct or pancreatic duct) were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Clinical: The mean age was 64 years, male/female ratio was 2.4, and mean tumor size was 2.7 cm. (2) Pathology: The tumors had a mixture of both papillary and tubular growth (each constituting at least 25% of the lesion) in 57%; predominantly (>75%) papillary in 23%, and predominantly (>75%) tubular in 20%. High-grade dysplasia was present in 94% of cases, of which 39% showed focal (<25% of the lesion), 28% showed substantial (25% to 75%), and 27% showed extensive (>75%) high-grade dysplasia. In terms of cell-lineage morphology, 45% had a mixture of patterns. However, when evaluated with a forced-binary approach as intestinal (INT) versus gastric/pancreatobiliary (GPB) based on the predominant pattern, 74% were classified as INT and 26% as GPB. (3) Immunohistochemistry: Percent sensitivity/specificity of cell-lineage markers were, for INT phenotype: MUC2 85/78 and CDX2 94/61; and for GBP: MUC1 89/79, MUC5AC 95/69, and MUC6 83/76, respectively. Cytokeratin 7 and 20 were coexpressed in more than half. (4) Invasive carcinoma: In 64 cases (78%), there was an associated invasive carcinoma. Size of the tumor and amount of dysplasia correlated with the incidence of invasion. Invasive carcinoma was of INT-type in 58% and of pancreatobiliary-type in 42%. Cell lineage in the invasive component was the same as that of the preinvasive component in 84%. All discrepant cases were pancreatobiliary-type invasions, which occurred in INT-type preinvasive lesions. (5) Outcome: The overall survival of invasive cases were significantly worse than that of noninvasive ones (57% vs. 93%; P=0.01); and 3 years, 69% versus 100% (P=0.08); and 5 years, 45% versus 100% (P=0.07), respectively. When compared with 166 conventional invasive carcinomas of the ampullary region, invasive IAPNs had significantly better prognosis with a mean survival of 51 versus 31 months (P<0.001) and the 3-year survival of 69% versus 44% (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia occurring within the ampulla are highly analogous to pancreatic or biliary intraductal papillary and tubular neoplasms as evidenced by their papillary and/or tubular growth, variable cell lineage, and spectrum of dysplastic change (adenoma-carcinoma sequence), and thus we propose to refer to these as IAPN. IAPNs are biologically indolent; noninvasive examples show an excellent prognosis, whereas those with invasion exhibit a malignant but nevertheless significantly better prognosis than typical invasive ampullary carcinomas unaccompanied by IAPNs. Twenty eight percent (64 of 230) of invasive carcinomas within the ampulla arise in association with IAPNs.",cancer
"Mutations in GNA11 in uveal melanoma. BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular cancer. There are no effective therapies for metastatic disease. Mutations in GNAQ, the gene encoding an alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, are found in 40% of uveal melanomas. METHODS: We sequenced exon 5 of GNAQ and GNA11, a paralogue of GNAQ, in 713 melanocytic neoplasms of different types (186 uveal melanomas, 139 blue nevi, 106 other nevi, and 282 other melanomas). We sequenced exon 4 of GNAQ and GNA11 in 453 of these samples and in all coding exons of GNAQ and GNA11 in 97 uveal melanomas and 45 blue nevi. RESULTS: We found somatic mutations in exon 5 (affecting Q209) and in exon 4 (affecting R183) in both GNA11 and GNAQ, in a mutually exclusive pattern. Mutations affecting Q209 in GNA11 were present in 7% of blue nevi, 32% of primary uveal melanomas, and 57% of uveal melanoma metastases. In contrast, we observed Q209 mutations in GNAQ in 55% of blue nevi, 45% of uveal melanomas, and 22% of uveal melanoma metastases. Mutations affecting R183 in either GNAQ or GNA11 were less prevalent (2% of blue nevi and 6% of uveal melanomas) than the Q209 mutations. Mutations in GNA11 induced spontaneously metastasizing tumors in a mouse model and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Of the uveal melanomas we analyzed, 83% had somatic mutations in GNAQ or GNA11. Constitutive activation of the pathway involving these two genes appears to be a major contributor to the development of uveal melanoma.

"Doxorubicin plus sorafenib vs doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: In a randomized phase 3 trial, 400 mg of sorafenib twice daily prolonged overall survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh A disease. In a phase 1 study, sorafenib combined with doxorubicin, 60 mg/m(2), was well tolerated by patients with refractory solid tumors. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin in patients with advanced HCC has not been evaluated in a phase 2 or 3 trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin plus sorafenib compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a double-blind phase 2 multinational study, conducted from April 2005 to October 2006, 96 patients (76% male; median age, 65 years [range, 38-82 years]) with advanced HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, Child-Pugh A status, and no prior systemic therapy were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin intravenously every 21 days plus either 400 mg of sorafenib or placebo orally twice a day. The date of the last patient's follow-up was April 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to progression as determined by independent review. RESULTS: Following complete accrual, an unplanned early analysis for efficacy was performed by the independent data monitoring committee, so the trial was halted. The 2 patients remaining in the placebo group at that time were offered sorafenib. Based on 51 progressions, 63 deaths, and 70 events for progression-free survival, median time to progression was 6.4 months in the sorafenib-doxorubicin group (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-9.2), and 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.6-5) in the doxorubicin-placebo monotherapy group (P = .02). Median overall survival was 13.7 months (95% CI, 8.9--not reached) and 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.5-9.9; P = .006), and progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.6-8.6) and 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.8) in these groups, respectively (P = .006). Toxicity profiles were similar to those for the single agents. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced HCC, treatment with sorafenib plus doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin monotherapy resulted in greater median time to progression, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The degree to which this improvement may represent synergism between sorafenib and doxorubicin remains to be defined. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin is not yet indicated for routine clinical use. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00108953.",cancer
"Patient-centered discussions about prostate cancer screening: a real-world approach. National guidelines recommend that primary care providers discuss the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening with their patients but give little guidance on how to fit such a complex discussion into a busy clinic encounter. The authors propose a process-oriented approach (Ask-Tell-Ask) that promotes tailored conversations and value-based recommendations. The Ask-Tell-Ask approach includes diagnosing a patient's informational needs, providing targeted education based on those needs, and making a shared decision about testing. This time-efficient model emphasizes the provider's role as an interactive guide rather than a one-way supplier of information. Although there is no way to make these discussions simple, this streamlined strategy can help patients and providers efficiently negotiate the complex and important decision of screening for prostate cancer.",cancer
"Transoral robotic surgery for advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. OBJECTIVES: To determine the oncologic and functional outcomes in patients undergoing primary transoral robotic surgery followed by adjuvant therapy as indicated with a minimum of 18-month follow-up for advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. DESIGN: Prospective single-center cohort study. SETTING: Academic university health system and tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Forty-seven adults with newly diagnosed and previously untreated advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. INTERVENTION: Transoral robotic surgery with staged neck dissection and adjuvant therapy as indicated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Margin status, recurrence, disease-specific and disease-free survival, gastrostomy tube dependence, and safety and efficacy end points. RESULTS: In the 47 patients enrolled with stages III and IV advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma, mean follow-up was 26.6 months. There was no intraoperative or postoperative mortality. Resection margins were positive in 1 patient (2%). At last follow-up, local recurrence was identified in 1 patient (2%), regional recurrence in 2 (4%), and distant recurrence in 4 (9%). Disease-specific survival was 98% (45 of 46 patients) at 1 year and 90% (27 of 30 patients) at 2 years. Based on pathologic risk stratification, 18 of 47 patients (38%) avoided chemotherapy, and 5 patients (11%) did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in their treatment regimen. At minimum follow-up of 1 year, only 1 patient required a gastrostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS: This novel transoral robotic surgery treatment regimen offers disease control, survival, and safety commensurate with standard treatments and an unexpected beneficial outcome of gastrostomy dependency rates that are markedly lower than those reported with standard nonsurgical therapies.",cancer
"Neck dissection after chemoradiotherapy: timing and complications. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of postchemoradiotherapy (post-CRT) neck dissection (ND) complications; to ascertain whether timing (< 12 vs >/= 12 weeks) from CRT to ND or other factors are associated with increased complications; and to determine whether ND timing influences disease control or survival. DESIGN: Ten-year retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: One hundred five patients with head and neck cancer undergoing ND after CRT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications and survival variables compared between groups undergoing ND less than 12 weeks (less-than-12-weeks ND group) and 12 weeks or more (12-weeks-or-more ND group) after CRT. RESULTS: Sixty-seven NDs were performed less than 12 weeks and 38 were performed 12 weeks or more after CRT. Patient characteristics, treatment, and ND pathology results were comparable between the 2 ND groups. The incidence of complications between the less-than-12-weeks and the 12-weeks-or-more ND groups included major wound complications in 8 of 67 (11.9%) vs 1 of 38 (2.6%; P = .15), minor wound complications in 11 of 67 (16.4%) vs 4 of 38 (10.5%; P = .56), airway complications in 7 of 67 (10.4%) vs 2 of 38 (5.3%; P = .48), and systemic complications in 9 of 67 (13.4%) vs 2 of 38 (5.3%; P = .32). The number of patients with at least 1 complication was significantly smaller in the 12-weeks-or-more ND group (P = .04). Multivariate analysis showed that radical ND was significantly associated with an increased number of complications, and higher radiation doses approached significance (P = .05). Induction chemotherapy was associated with fewer wound complications (P = .01). There were no significant differences in overall survival (P = .82), progression-free survival (P = .77), or regional relapse (P = .54) between groups. Positive ND findings were associated with diminished progression-free and overall survival. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that ND can be safely performed 12 weeks or more after CRT without adversely affecting surgical complications or survival variables.",cancer
"Hearing loss and complaint in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate occurrences of hearing loss and hearing complaints among patients with head and neck tumors who underwent radiotherapy. DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-two participants underwent evaluation, including 141 with head and neck tumors and 141 as an age-matched control group. The controls had never undergone oncological treatment that put their hearing at risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of audiological evaluation, including the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly questionnaire and pure-tone, speech, and immittance audiometry, and radiation dose received by the auditory system (based on the percentage of the external auditory canal included in the radiation field). RESULTS: We observed occurrences of hearing loss in 102 (72.3%) of the participants exposed to radiotherapy and 69 (48.9%) of the control group (P < .001). Hearing losses were mostly sensorineural and of mild degree, but those exposed to radiotherapy more frequently presented with severe and mixed-type hearing losses (P < .001). Of the participants exposed to radiotherapy, 19.1% had a severe handicap (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing radiotherapy in the head and neck region have a higher incidence of hearing loss and more severe hearing handicap.

"Surgery for papillary thyroid carcinoma: is lobectomy enough? OBJECTIVE: To further understanding of treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). DESIGN: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database was searched for patients who had undergone surgery for PTC. SETTING: Areas covered by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population-based registries. PATIENTS: Patients who had undergone PTC surgery between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2001, were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the total 22,724 patients with PTC, 5964 patients underwent lobectomy. There were 2138 total and 471 disease-specific deaths. Controlling for tumor size, multivariate analysis revealed no survival difference between patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy and those who had undergone lobectomy. Increased tumor size, extrathyroidal extent, positive nodal status, and increased age displayed significantly worse DSS and OS (P < .001). Histologically, follicular PTC subtype did not affect DSS or OS. Patients who had received radioactive iodine had poorer DSS but improved OS. Patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy had poor DSS (hazard ratio, 4.48; 95% confidence interval, 3.30-6.06; P < .001) and OS (1.71; 1.42-2.07; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study compel us to reinvestigate the current PTC surgical recommendations of total thyroidectomy based on tumor size because this may not affect survival across all populations. In addition, the current use of external beam radiation therapy for the treatment of PTC should be reexamined.",cancer
"Laparoscopic vs open hepatic resection for benign and malignant tumors: An updated meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare laparoscopic hepatic resection (LHR) with open hepatic resection (OHR) for benign and malignant tumors. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant studies published between January 1, 1998, and May 1, 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Studies clearly documenting a comparison of LHR with OHR for benign and malignant neoplasms were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Operative and postoperative measures, resection margins, complications, and survival outcomes were evaluated. Weighted mean differences, relative risks, and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included in the meta-analysis. The HR of death for malignant tumors was significantly lower in the LHR group compared with the OHR group (HR, 0.64; P = .04). The HR of recurrence for malignant tumors was not significantly different between the 2 groups (HR, 0.79; P = .37). The LHR group had a lower operative blood loss (weighted mean difference, -161 mL; P < .001) and relative risk of total postoperative complications (relative risk, 0.40; P < .001). Duration of hospital stay, days of intravenous narcotic use, and days until oral intake were all significantly lower in the LHR group compared with the OHR group. Operative time between LHR and OHR was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic hepatic resection for malignant tumors is associated with a long-term survival that is at least comparable, if not superior, to OHR with no difference in disease recurrence. The use of LHR for benign and malignant tumors is a safe alternative to OHR with potential operative and postoperative benefits.",cancer
"Risk factors for invasive breast cancer when core needle biopsy shows ductal carcinoma in situ. HYPOTHESIS: A core needle biopsy (CNB) diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be associated with a final diagnosis of invasive cancer. Preoperative radiologic, clinical, and pathological features may identify patients at high risk of diagnostic upstaging, who may be appropriate candidates for sentinel node biopsy at initial surgery. DESIGN: Review of prospectively collected database. SETTING: Tertiary teaching referral hospital and a population-based breast screening center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2006, whose CNB findings showed DCIS or DCIS with microinvasion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Upstaging to invasive cancer. RESULTS: Eleven of 15 cases of DCIS with microinvasion (73.3%) and 65 of 375 cases of DCIS (17.3%) were upstaged to invasive cancer. Ten of 21 palpable lesions (47.6%) were found to have microinvasion. For impalpable DCIS, multivariate analysis showed that noncalcific mammographic features (mass, architectural distortion, or nonspecific density) (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.00 [1.02-3.94]), mammographic size of 20 mm or greater (2.80 [1.46-5.38]), and prolonged screening interval of 3 years or longer (4.41 [1.60-12.13]) were associated with upstaging. The DCIS grade on CNB was significant on univariate analysis (P = .04). The rate of upstaging increased with the number of significant factors present in a patient: 8.3% in patients with no risk factors, 20.8% in those with 1 risk factor, 39.6% in those with 2 risk factors, and 57.1% in those with 3 risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of upstaging can be estimated by using preoperative features in patients with DCIS on CNB. We propose a management algorithm that includes sentinel node biopsy for patients with DCIS who have microinvasion on CNB, palpable DCIS, 2 or more predictive factors, and planned total mastectomy.",cancer
"Surgeon subspecialty as a factor in improving long-term outcomes for gastric cancer: Twenty years of experience in Korea. BACKGROUND: The results of gastric cancer treatment have improved during the past 2 decades. In addition to early diagnosis, surgeon experience and subspecialty may influence long-term outcomes. This study analyzed data accumulated during the past 20 years regarding the impact of surgical subspecialty on gastric cancer prognosis. DESIGN: A 20-year, retrospective study. SETTING: Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul. PATIENTS: A total of 2797 patients admitted between 1984 and 2003 with surgically treated, pathologically confirmed, primary gastric adenocarcinoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Long-term survival. RESULTS: The incidence of total gastrectomy and the number of retrieved lymph nodes increased during the study period. In curative cases, 5-year survival improved from 66.1% to 76.6%, and this survival gain was restricted to stages I, III, and IV. A Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that age, sex, tumor location, type of resection, stage, and the interaction between period of study and surgical subspecialty were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: This large, long-term cohort study demonstrates that the management of gastric cancer has been largely successful, with favorable trends in prognostic factors. Successful outcomes are realized more often by gastric surgical specialists. Efforts must be made to improve the treatment of patients with stage II gastric cancer because the improvements in long-term results have plateaued.",cancer

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) during the early survivorship period as well as demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors associated with BCRL development. DESIGN: The Pathways Study, a prospective cohort study of breast cancer survivors with a mean follow-up time of 20.9 months. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical care program. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 997 women diagnosed from January 9, 2006, through October 15, 2007, with primary invasive breast cancer and who were at least 21 years of age at diagnosis, had no history of any cancer, and spoke English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical indication for BCRL as determined from outpatient or hospitalization diagnostic codes, outpatient procedural codes, and durable medical equipment orders. RESULTS: A clinical indication for BCRL was found in 133 women (13.3%), with a mean time to diagnosis of 8.3 months (range, 0.7-27.3 months). Being African American (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.72) or more educated (P for trend = .03) was associated with an increased risk of BCRL. Removal of at least 1 lymph node (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.07) was associated with an increased risk, yet no significant association was observed for type of lymph node surgery. Being obese at breast cancer diagnosis was suggestive of an elevated risk (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-2.31). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort study, BCRL occurs among a substantial proportion of early breast cancer survivors. Our findings agree with those of previous studies on the increased risk of BCRL with removal of lymph nodes and being obese, but they point to a differential risk according to race or ethnicity.",cancer
"Specific nail alterations in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: successful treatment with topical mechlorethamine. BACKGROUND: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can be associated with clinically significant nail alterations, the presentation of which can be protean and misleading. To date, only a few reports have demonstrated direct specific tumor infiltration of the nail bed, while little is known about the efficacy of topical treatments. OBSERVATIONS: We describe the case of a 93-year-old man presenting with Sezary syndrome who developed clinically significant nail alterations. Light microscopy studies and T-cell receptor rearrangement analysis demonstrated the presence of a specific lymphocytic infiltrate within the nail bed. The patient was given repeated courses of topical mechlorethamine, leading to a sustained complete remission of both skin and nail alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Specific nail involvement should be recognized and considered in all patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Topical mechlorethamine remains an attractive therapeutic option in cases of specific nail alterations, especially for situations in which systemic therapies are either not indicated or unlikely to be well tolerated.",cancer
"Thyrotoxicosis with pegylated interferon alfa-2b. BACKGROUND: Despite adequate surgery, a diagnosis of stage III melanoma carries a high risk of relapse, and hence mortality. Interferon alfa is the only treatment that has currently been shown to alter the natural history of the disease, delaying relapse-free survival, particularly in patients with micrometastatic disease. There is also recent evidence of a prognostic advantage conferred by the development of autoimmune conditions in patients receiving adjuvant interferon therapy. OBSERVATIONS: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with stage IIIa melanoma who was entered into the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer 18991 trial of 5-year adjuvant treatment with pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2b. The patient developed thyrotoxicosis 3 months after commencing treatment, which required treatment with propylthiouracil. The degree of thyrotoxicosis corresponded closely to the dose of peginterferon alfa-2b given. However, in this patient, the hyperthyroidism resolved spontaneously after 4 years when peginterferon treatment was still ongoing. Seven years following the initial diagnosis, the patient has not had disease relapse. CONCLUSION: Hyperthyroidism is less common than hypothyroidism as a consequence of interferon therapy, and this case is atypical in that it resolved spontaneously during interferon therapy but is in accordance with the recent evidence of a positive association between interferon-associated autoimmunity and prognosis.",cancer
"Dermoscopic island: a new descriptor for thin melanoma. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and the features of the dermoscopic island (DI) in melanocytic lesions and to assess its specificity for the diagnosis of melanoma. Dermoscopy improves the diagnostic accuracy of melanoma, but only a few dermoscopic descriptors specific for thin melanomas have been identified. We defined a new descriptor, the dermoscopic island, a well-circumscribed area showing a uniform dermoscopic pattern that differs from the rest of the pigmented lesion. DESIGN: Dermoscopic images of 96 in situ melanomas, 266 invasive melanomas, and 612 dermoscopic atypical nevi were evaluated to establish the presence and the main pattern of the DI. Also, clinical and histologic characteristics were analyzed. SETTING: Dermoscopic images were collected from lesions excised between 2003 and 2008 at the Department of Dermatology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Specificity and odds ratio for melanoma; dermoscopic and histologic characteristics of lesions with a DI. RESULTS: The DI was present in 10.4% of in situ melanomas, 4.1% of invasive melanomas, and 3.1% of dermoscopic atypical nevi. The odds ratio for melanoma was 1.922, and specificity was 96.9%. Invasive melanomas with a DI were thinner than those lacking this descriptor. In addition, more than half of the melanomas with a DI arose on a nevus. The DI appeared mainly reticular on a reticular background. CONCLUSION: The DI is characteristic of thin melanoma arising in a nevus; thus, it can be considered a potential early sign of transformation of a nevus into a melanoma.",cancer
"Environmental cues to UV radiation and personal sun protection in outdoor winter recreation. OBJECTIVE: To predict the prevalence of UV radiation (hereinafter, UV) at North American ski resorts using temporal, seasonal, altitudinal, and meteorological factors and associate UV with a set of adult sun protection behaviors. DESIGN: Ultraviolet radiation observations and cross-sectional survey of adults on sun protection were collected. SETTING: Data were collected at 32 high-altitude ski areas located in western North America from 2001 through 2003. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 3937 adult skiers or snowboarders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of direct, reflected, and diffuse UV were performed at 487 measurement points using handheld meters and combined with self-reported and observed sun protection assessed for adults interviewed on chairlifts. RESULTS: The strongest predictors of UV were temporal proximity to noon, deviation from winter solstice, and clear skies. By contrast, altitude and latitude had more modest associations with UV and temperature had a small positive relationship with UV. Guest sun safety was inconsistently associated with UV: UV was positively related to adults wearing more sunscreen, reapplying it after 2 hours, and wearing protective eyewear, but fewer adults exhibited many of the other sun protection behaviors, such as wearing hats and protective clothing or using lip balm, on days when UV was elevated. Guests took more sun safety precautions on clear-sky days but took steps to maintain body warmth on inclement days. CONCLUSIONS: In future sun safety promotions, adults should be encouraged to wear sunscreen on cloudy days because UV is still high and conditions can change rapidly. They need reminders to rely more on season and time of day when judging UV and the need for sun safety.",cancer
"Early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma: a sign of impending ulceration. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma (IH) and ulceration. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A case series of 11 infants with early white discoloration of IH are described. An additional 55 infants with IH, aged 3 months, were evaluated retrospectively from a photograph archive to further explore the relationship between early white discoloration and presence or development of ulceration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics and hemangioma size, location, and subtype are documented. Sensitivity and specificity of white discoloration in relationship to ulceration are estimated. RESULTS: Ten of the 11 infants in the case series were girls (90%); all IHs were of segmental or indeterminate subtype. Average age at first ulceration was 2.6 months, with average age at healing 5.2 months. No intervention halted progression of ulceration. Of the 55 additional 3-month-old infants, 14 had white discoloration and 12 of these 14 had or developed ulceration (86%). When the hemangioma was either white or slightly white, sensitivity for predicting ulceration was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-1.00), with a specificity of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.51-0.81). In contrast, in infants with either slightly white or no white discoloration, the sensitivity for not developing ulceration was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96), with a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.83-0.99), suggesting that a lack of substantial white discoloration early in infancy indicates low risk of ulceration. CONCLUSION: Early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma is highly suggestive of impending ulceration.",cancer
"Uncertainty in the perioperative management of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma among Mohs surgeons. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Mohs surgeons' management of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HRCSCC) is uniform regarding radiologic nodal staging (RNS) and adjuvant radiation therapy (ART). DESIGN: A survey study of randomly selected, fellowship-trained Mohs surgeons. SETTING: An academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: American College of Mohs Surgery members who responded to an e-mail invitation completed either a survey regarding management of HRCSCC (n=117) or SCC with perineural invasion (PNI) (n=118). Participants totaled approximately 25% of the American College of Mohs Surgery membership. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Percentage of patients with HRCSCC referred for RNS, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), or ART over the preceding 12 months; (2) top factors leading surgeons to consider RNS, SLNB, or ART; and (3) acceptance of ART for clinical scenarios of various degrees of PNI. RESULTS: Most respondents cited PNI and in-transit metastasis as top factors leading to consideration of RNS, SLNB, or ART. Otherwise, there was no consensus regarding use of, or indications for, RNS, SLNB, or ART. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of consistency between experts indicates that there is equipoise regarding indications for RNS and ART in HRCSCC. There is also wide variation in RNS and ART practices among Mohs surgeons who are specifically trained to manage HRCSCC. Clinical trials should therefore be conducted in these areas as there is no clear standard of care.",cancer
"The essence of senescence. Almost half a century after the first reports describing the limited replicative potential of primary cells in culture, there is now overwhelming evidence for the existence of ""cellular senescence"" in vivo. It is being recognized as a critical feature of mammalian cells to suppress tumorigenesis, acting alongside cell death programs. Here, we review the various features of cellular senescence and discuss their contribution to tumor suppression. Additionally, we highlight the power and limitations of the biomarkers currently used to identify senescent cells in vitro and in vivo.",cancer
"The value of 99mTc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT in predicting survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT has been reported as a useful tool for the evaluation of glioma proliferation. In the present study, we set out to investigate the prognostic value of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. METHODS: We prospectively studied 18 patients (13 men, 5 women; mean age +/- SD, 60.8 +/- 7.79 y) who were operated on for glioblastoma multiforme. All patients underwent preoperative (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT, and surgical excision was performed within a week after SPECT. All patients received postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: By calculating the lesion-to-normal (L/N) (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake ratio, we found that patients with an L/N ratio of more than 4.7 had significantly worse survival than did patients with an L/N ratio of 4.7 or less. Furthermore, patients with a Karnofsky Performance Score more than 90 had a significantly better survival rate. Although patients with near-total tumor resection who were younger than 60 y survived longer, the difference did not reach statistical significance. In the multivariate analysis, (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake and Karnofsky Performance Score were identified as factors with independent prognostic power. CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT may be an independent prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Further larger studies are needed to verify these results.",cancer
"Early repeated 18F-FDG PET scans during neoadjuvant chemoradiation fail to predict histopathologic response or survival benefit in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. This study evaluated the role of (18)F-FDG PET as an early predictor of histopathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus undergoing multimodal therapy. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus underwent pretreatment and an intratreatment (18)F-FDG PET scan in the second week of a 6-wk regimen of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Histopathologic response and overall survival were correlated with percentage change in (18)F-FDG uptake (%Deltamaximum standardized uptake value [%DeltaSUVmax]). RESULTS: In 16 patients (43%), treatment induced a histopathologic response (<10% viable tumor cells), which was associated with a significant (P < 0.05) survival benefit. The optimal reduction in (18)F-FDG uptake, which separated histopathologic responders and nonresponders, was a -26.4% DeltaSUVmax (receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis). At this separation, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) were 62.5%, 71.4%, 62.5%, 71.4%, and 67.4%, respectively, for intratreatment (18)F-FDG PET scans. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of (18)F-FDG PET responders (>26.4% reduction in SUVmax), compared with (18)F-FDG PET nonresponders (<26.4% reduction in SUVmax), revealed no survival benefit for responders (P = 0.6812). CONCLUSION: The %DeltaSUVmax during the second week of induction chemoradiation did not correlate either with histopathologic response or with survival. Our results show that, in contrast to published reports on neoadjuvant chemotherapy, combined chemoradiotherapy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus lowers the predictive accuracy of early repeated (18)F-FDG PET in identifying histopathologic responders and those with chances for increased survival below clinically applicable levels.",cancer
"Repeatability of metabolically active volume measurements with 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT PET in non-small cell lung cancer. In addition to tumor size measurements with CT, there is a need for quantitative measurements of metabolic active volumes, possibly adding to tracer uptake measurements in oncologic response evaluation with PET. The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic volume test-retest variability in (18)F-FDG and 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) PET studies for various commonly used volumes of interest (VOIs) and the dependence of that variability on lesion size and relative radiotracer uptake. METHODS: Twenty non-small cell lung cancer patients were scanned twice with (18)F-FDG (n = 11) or (18)F-FLT (n = 9). VOIs were defined on images reconstructed with normalization- and attenuation-weighted ordered-subset expectation maximization using 4 isocontours (A41%, A50%, and A70% thresholds, adapted for local background, and 50% threshold, uncorrected for background). Statistical analysis comprised intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: In the (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT groups, 34 and 20 lesions, respectively, were analyzed. Median volumes at the A50% threshold were 3.31 and 2.19 mL (interquartile range, 1.91-8.90 and 1.52-7.27 mL) for (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0.9, with the exception of the A70%-based metabolic volumes for (18)F-FLT. For lesions greater than 4.2 mL, repeatability coefficients (RCs = 1.96 x SD) of the percentage difference ranged from 22% to 37% for (18)F-FDG and from 39% to 73% for (18)F-FLT, depending on the VOI method being used. Repeatability was better for larger tumors, but there was no dependence on absolute uptake (standardized uptake value). CONCLUSION: Results indicate that changes of greater than 37% for (18)F-FDG and greater than 73% for (18)F-FLT (1.96 x SD) for lesions with A50% metabolic volumes greater than 4.2 mL represent a biologic effect. For smaller lesions (A50% VOI < 4.2 mL), an absolute change of 1.0 and 0.9 mL for (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT, respectively, is biologically relevant. Considering the balance between the success rate of automatic tumor delineation and repeatability of metabolic volume, a 50% threshold with correction for local background activity (A50%) seems optimal among the VOI methods evaluated.",cancer
Molecular mechanisms of bone 18F-NaF deposition. There is renewed interest in (18)F-NaF bone imaging with PET or PET/CT.

"Improvement of early 18F-FDG PET interpretation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: importance of the reference background. This study investigated whether the reference background above which a residual mass is considered positive in the International Harmonization Project criteria should be modified for early (18)F-FDG PET evaluation. METHODS: In 92 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured on post-cycle 2 PET in the most intense residual mass (or, in the case of negative PET findings, in the area of most intense tumor uptake before therapy), in the mediastinal blood pool (MBP) and the liver, as potential reference background tissues. RESULTS: With MBP as a reference (SUVmax, 2.0 +/- 0.6), PET was unable to distinguish early responders from nonresponders. In contrast, with liver as a reference (SUVmax, 2.5 +/- 0.7), 2-y progression-free survival was significantly different between patients with PET-negative findings (81.8% [95% confidence interval, 71%-93%]) and patients with PET-positive findings (51.8% [95% confidence interval, 35%-69%], P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: When assessing early response, particularly in risk-adapted therapeutic trials, it seems preferable to refer to a background tissue (liver) with a higher level of uptake than that of current international criteria (MBP) which were designed for end-of-treatment evaluation.",cancer
"18F-FDG PET/CT for the prediction and detection of local recurrence after radiofrequency ablation of malignant lung lesions. The utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for response assessment in malignant lung tumors treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and for the detection and prediction of local recurrence was investigated. METHODS: Between December 17, 2003, and April 9, 2008, 68 consecutive patients (mean age, 68 y) with 94 pulmonary lesions, including metastases (n = 38) and primary lung cancers (n = 44), underwent RFA. Because of inadequate imaging follow-up in 12 patients, only 82 lesions were analyzed (CT scans, n = 82; (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans, n = 62). The median follow-up was 25 mo (range, 12-66 mo). A baseline study was defined as (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed no more than 3 mo before RFA. The first postablation scan was defined as PET/CT performed between 1 and 4 mo after RFA; additional follow-up studies were obtained in some cases between 6 and 12 mo after RFA. The unidimensional maximum diameter of the lesion was recorded on a pretherapy diagnostic CT scan or on the CT component of a pretherapy (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan, whichever was obtained most recently, using lung windows. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) were recorded for all lesions imaged by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. (18)F-FDG uptake patterns on post-RFA scans were classified as favorable or unfavorable. Survival and recurrence probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Uni- and multivariate analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Before RFA, factors predicting greater local recurrence-free survival included initial lesion size less than 3 cm (P = 0.01) and SUV less than 8 (P = 0.02), although the latter was not an independent predictor in multivariate analysis. Treated metastases recurred less often than treated primary lung cancers (P = 0.03). Important post-RFA factors that related to reduced recurrence-free survival included an unfavorable uptake pattern (P < 0.01), post-RFA SUV (P < 0.01), and an increase in SUV over time after ablation (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters on both preablation and postablation scans may predict local recurrence in patients treated with RFA for lung metastases and primary lung cancers.",cancer
"Culture of omentum-induced regenerating liver yielded hepatocyte-committed stem cells. Earlier we showed that when omentum, activated by inert particles, is allowed to fuse to a wedge cut in the liver, it induces stem cell proliferation in the liver resulting in massive liver regeneration. Here, we attempt to culture stem cells from the omentum-induced regenerating liver tissue. Cells from regenerating liver tissue were harvested and cultured. Cultured cells were characterized by immune staining, fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis, growth factor assay, in vitro differentiation, and their ability to engraft to injured sites in vivo. Culture yielded cells with a mesenchymal stem cell phenotype that could be maintained in culture indefinitely. These cells, called regenerating liver stem cells, expressed both adult and embryonic stem cell markers, secreted high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, and expressed albumin. When grown on matrigel in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor, these cells differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells in culture, but they did not differentiate to adipogenic and osteogenic lineages when grown in specific differentiation medium. The differentiated cells expressed alpha-fetoprotein and secreted high levels of albumin and urea. After systemic injection, the undifferentiated cells engrafted only to the injured sites in the liver and not to the normal areas of the liver. In conclusion, omentum-induced regenerating liver yields hepatocyte-committed stem cells in culture. Such cells could prove to be useful in cell transplantation therapies.",cancer
"Higher levels of GATA3 predict better survival in women with breast cancer. The GATA family members are zinc finger transcription factors involved in cell differentiation and proliferation. GATA3 in particular is necessary for mammary gland maturation, and its loss has been implicated in breast cancer development. Our goal was to validate the ability of GATA3 expression to predict survival in breast cancer patients. Protein expression of GATA3 was analyzed on a high-density tissue microarray consisting of 242 cases of breast cancer. We associated GATA3 expression with patient outcomes and clinicopathologic variables. Expression of GATA3 was significantly increased in breast cancer, in situ lesions, and hyperplastic tissue compared with normal breast tissue. GATA3 expression decreased with increasing tumor grade. Low GATA3 expression was a significant predictor of disease-related death in all patients, as well as in subgroups of estrogen receptor-positive or low-grade patients. In addition, low GATA3 expression correlated with increased tumor size and estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity. GATA3 is an important predictor of disease outcome in breast cancer patients. This finding has been validated in a diverse set of populations. Thus, GATA3 expression has utility as a prognostic indicator in breast cancer.",cancer
"Expression of master regulatory genes controlling skeletal development in benign cartilage and bone forming tumors. Recent progress in skeletal molecular biology has led to the clarification of the transcriptional mechanisms of chondroblastic and osteoblastic lineage differentiation. Three master transcription factors-Sox9, Runx2, and Osterix-were shown to play an essential role in determining the skeletal progenitor cells' fate. The present study evaluates the expression of these factors in 4 types of benign bone tumors-chondromyxoid fibroma, chondroblastoma, osteoid osteoma, and osteoblastoma-using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays. Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma showed strong nuclear expression of Osterix and Runx2. In contrast, only a few chondroblastomas showed positive nuclear expression of Osterix. Strong nuclear expression of Sox9 was detected in all chondroblastomas, whereas nearly half of the osteoblastomas showed focal weak cytoplasmic expression of Sox9.",cancer
"The epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in relation to pelvic lymph node metastasis and survival in early-stage cervical cancer. The objective of this study is to correlate the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) components with clinical behavior of early-stage cervical cancer. Tissue samples of 336 consecutive Federation of International Gynecologists and Obstetricians stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients all treated primarily by radical surgery were collected. Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were prospectively obtained during standard treatment and follow-up. As representatives for the EGFR pathway, expression of EGFR, pEGFR, PTEN, pAKT, and pERK was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Positive immunostaining was observed for EGFR in 32.1%, for pEGFR in 21.0%, for PTEN in 38.3%, for pAKT in 5.3%, and for pERK in 4.3% of tumor samples. Positive EGFR immunostaining was associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (odds ratio [OR], 7.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.38-16.23, P < .001), negative pEGFR immunostaining with poor differentiation (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.73, P = .004), and negative PTEN immunostaining with metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.90, P = .019). In multivariate analysis, only pelvic lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio, 6.11; 95% CI, 3.46-10.77, P < .001) and poor differentiation (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.12-3.26, P = .018) were related to disease-specific survival. In early-stage cervical cancer, loss of PTEN expression is associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis, suggesting PTEN to be one of the tumor suppressor genes affecting pelvic lymph node metastasis. However, expression of EGFR pathway components does not appear to have prognostic impact in surgically treated early-stage cervical cancer.",cancer
"Significant association between polymorphism of the erythropoietin gene promoter and myelodysplastic syndrome. BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) may be induced by certain mutagenic environmental or chemotherapeutic toxins; however, the role of susceptibility genes remains unclear. The G/G genotype of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1617640 in the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased EPO expression. We examined the association of rs1617640 genotype with MDS. METHODS: We genotyped the EPO rS1617640 SNP in 189 patients with MDS, 257 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 106 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 97 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 353 with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 95 healthy controls. RESULTS: The G/G genotype was significantly more common in MDS patients (47/187; 25.1%) than in controls (6/95; 6.3%) or in patients with other leukemias (101/813; 12.4%) (all P < 0.001). Individuals with the G/G genotype were more likely than those with other genotypes to have MDS (odd ratio = 4.98; 95% CI = 2.04-12.13). Clinical and follow up data were available for 112 MDS patients and 186 AML patients. There was no correlation between EPO promoter genotype and response to therapy or overall survival in MDS or AML. In the MDS group, the GG genotype was significantly associated with shorter complete remission duration, as compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.03). Time to neutrophils recovery after therapy was significantly longer in MDS patients with the G/G genotype (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a strong association between the rs1617640 G/G genotype and MDS. Further studies are warranted to investigate the utility of screening for this marker in individuals exposed to environmental toxins or chemotherapy.",cancer
"Therapeutic molecular targets in human chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcomas are malignant cartilage tumours. They are poorly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Treatment is usually limited to surgical resection; however, survival of patients with high-grade chondrosarcoma is poor, even with wide surgical resection. Induction of apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells, either directly or by enhancement of the response to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation, may be a route by which outcome can be improved. In this article, we review potential molecular targets that regulate chondrocyte apoptosis and discuss the experimental evidence for their utility.",cancer
"Obtusilactone A and (-)-sesamin induce apoptosis in human lung cancer cells by inhibiting mitochondrial Lon protease and activating DNA damage checkpoints. Several compounds from Cinnamomum kotoense show anticancer activities. However, the detailed mechanisms of most compounds from C. kotoense remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of obtusilactone A (OA) and (-)-sesamin in lung cancer. Our results show that human Lon is upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, and downregulation of Lon triggers caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. Through enzyme-based screening, we identified two small-molecule compounds, obtusilactone A (OA) and (-)-sesamin from C. kotoense, as potent Lon protease inhibitors. Obtusilactone A and (-)-sesamin interact with Ser855 and Lys898 residues in the active site of the Lon protease according to molecular docking analysis. Thus, we suggest that cancer cytotoxicity of the compounds is partly due to the inhibitory effects on Lon protease. In addition, the compounds are able to cause DNA double-strand breaks and activate checkpoints. Treatment with OA and (-)-sesamin induced p53-independent DNA damage responses in NSCLC cells, including G(1) /S checkpoint activation and apoptosis, as evidenced by phosphorylation of checkpoint proteins (H2AX, Nbs1, and Chk2), caspase-3 cleavage, and sub-G(1) accumulation. In conclusion, OA and (-)-sesamin act as both inhibitors of human mitochondrial Lon protease and DNA damage agents to activate the DNA damage checkpoints as well induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells. These dual functions open a bright avenue to develop more selective chemotherapy agents to overcome chemoresistance and sensitize cancer cells to other chemotherapeutics.",cancer
"Phase I/II study of a 3-week cycle of irinotecan and S-1 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The combination of an oral fluoropyrimidine derivative, S-1, and irinotecan is expected to be a promising regimen for advanced colorectal cancer. This study was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of irinotecan combined with S-1 in a 3-week cycle regimen and to observe the safety and efficacy for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer. Eighty milligrams per m(2) of S-1 was given orally for 14 consecutive days and escalated doses of irinotecan were administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks in the phase I trial. Forty patients were treated at the RD during the phase II trial. Forty-three patients were enrolled between February 2005 and March 2007. The dose-limiting toxicity was diarrhea and abdominal pain. The MTD of irinotecan was 100 mg/m(2) and the RD was determined to be 80 mg/m(2) of irinotecan combined with 80 mg/m(2) of S-1. The phase II trial showed that 22 of 40 patients achieved a complete or partial response and eight had stable disease. The overall response rate was 55.0%. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 6.7 and 21 months, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths. The main toxicities were leukopenia, neutropenia, anorexia and diarrhea. This study suggests the combination of irinotecan and S-1 repeated every 3 weeks is tolerable and effective for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer.",cancer

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised incidence and mortality ratios. RESULTS: Compared with the total Queensland population, Indigenous Queenslanders had a lower overall incidence of cancer (standardised incidence ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.75-0.82), but a higher incidence of some of the more fatal cancer types. Overall cancer mortality was higher (standardised mortality ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.28-1.45) and similar to rates for Indigenous people in other Australian states. CONCLUSION: Cancer rates for Indigenous Queenslanders, a mostly urbanised population, are similar to rates for Indigenous Australians mostly living in remote areas.",cancer
"Twenty-five years of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in Western Australia: how do we compare? OBJECTIVES: To compare survival among the subgroup of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who were treated at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) in Perth, Western Australia, over 25 years under 15 consecutive protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) with survival for the entire cohort of children in multiple centres treated under CCG protocols in that period; and to highlight the benefits of membership of a large cooperative research group conducting multicentre randomised controlled trials. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Retrospective review of the outcomes of all 311 children with newly diagnosed ALL treated at PMH between 1983 and 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 4-year event-free survival; and 10-year overall survival. RESULTS: Four-year event-free survival for the entire PMH cohort increased from 66% (SE, 6%) for 1983-1987 to 88% (SE, 6%) for 2002-2005, while overall survival over the same period improved from 78% (SE, 5%) to 94% (SE, 4%). Comparisons of outcomes of children treated at PMH with those of the entire CCG cohort, protocol by protocol, revealed similar outcomes. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of children treated at PMH over the 25-year period are equivalent to those of the larger CCG cohort.",cancer
"Symptoms, investigations and management of patients with cancer of the oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction in Australia. OBJECTIVE: To document presenting symptoms, investigations and management for Australian patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GOJAC) and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of a population-based sample of 1100 Australian patients aged 18-79 years with histologically confirmed oesophageal cancer diagnosed in 2002-2005, using data from cancer registries and treatment centres, supplemented with clinical information collected through medical record review in 2006-2007 and mortality information collected in 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of primary symptoms, and staging investigations and treatment modalities used. RESULTS: The primary presenting symptom was dysphagia, which was self-reported by 41%, 39% and 48% of patients with OAC, GOJAC and OSCC, respectively. Less common symptoms were reflux, chest pain, bleeding and weight loss. All patients underwent endoscopy, most had a staging computed tomography scan (OAC 93%, GOJAC 95% and OSCC 93%), and about half had positron emission tomography scans (OAC 51%, GOJAC 44% and OSCC 42%). Pretreatment tumour stage was reported in 25% of records, and could be derived from results of investigations in a further 23%, but the remaining half lacked sufficient information to ascribe a pretreatment stage. Curative treatments were attempted for 60% of OAC, 88% of GOJAC and 65% of OSCC patients. Surgery was performed on 52% of OAC, 83% of GOJAC and 41% of OSCC patients. About two-thirds of surgical patients received additional therapies. CONCLUSIONS: With anticipated increases in oesophageal cancer incidence, the resources required to diagnose and manage patients with oesphageal cancer are also likely to rise. Our data provide a baseline from which to plan for the future care of patients with cancers of the oesophagus.",cancer
"Obesity and microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with higher Body Mass Index (BMI) might have more microvascular invasion (MVI) in their tumors. METHODS: Records from 138 consecutive patients who underwent surgery at Columbia University Medical Center from January 1, 2002 to January 9, 2008 were evaluated. RESULTS: 40 patients (29%) had MVI, including 14% with BMI <25, 31% with BMI = 25-30, and 40% with BMI >30 (p = .05). However, only maximum alpha-fetoprotein was significantly associated with overall mortality in a Cox model. CONCLUSIONS: MVI was associated with obesity. A better understanding of the mechanism of this association may lead to interventions for the treatment and prevention of HCC.",cancer
Huge endometriosis presenting like an ovarian tumor: CT appearance. A 32-year-old female with a clinical history of abdominal swelling underwent CT of the abdomen. A huge biloculated cystic mass with a mural nodule in the abdominal and pelvic region was seen. The lesion showed slightly homogeneous enhancement. The imaging findings suggested an ovarian tumor. Histopathological evaluation after surgical resection revealed that the lesion was a bilateral ovarian endometriosis.,cancer
"Ovarian torsion; early diagnosis by MRI to prevent irreversible damage. BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of ovarian torsion can help prevent irreversible damage to the adnexal structures in women desiring to maintain fertility. CASE: The patient was transferred by ambulance for a six-hour history of severe lower abdominal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral enlarged ovaries measuring 5 x 6 cm (right) and 4 x 5 cm (left) with a right twisted and thickened peduncle. Ultrasonography failed to detect the peduncle changes. At surgery, the right adnexa was twisted 180 degrees in a clockwise direction with no findings suggestive of gangrenous change, hemorrhagic infarction or ischemic change. Detorsion of the twisted ovary was performed. CONCLUSION: Detection of tube torsion at MRI may be useful in the preoperative evaluation for surgical detorsion of twisted adnexa encountered in enlarged ovaries.",cancer
"Pregnancy and adnexal torsion: analysis of 20 cases. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile, management and outcome of pregnancy complicated by adnexal torsion. METHODS: All pregnancy cases complicated by adnexal torsion admitted between January 2001 and January 2009 were analyzed. RESULTS: The total number of pregnant cases was 20. Age range of pregnant women with adnexal torsion was 18 to 42 years. Of these cases 70% were seen in the first and second trimester. Seventy percent of cases were operated by the laparotomy route and 30% by laparoscopy. Salpingo-oophorectomy was performed in 70% of cases and detorsion in 30% of cases. Histopathologic examinations revealed five patients (25%) had serous cystadenoma, four patients (20%) mucinous cystadenoma, six patients (20%) dermoid cyst and five patients (25%) hemorrhagic cyst. CONLUSIONS: Adnexal torsion as a differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in pregnancy should be considered and we recommend early surgical treatment that will save the adnexa.",cancer
"Is insulin-dependent diabetes and obesity a predisposition for endometrial and pancreatic carcinoma? Among 178 patients operated for endometrial carcinoma during a five-year period, 17 were re-operated at the Institute of Surgery (9.5%) because of pancreatic head carcinoma. The frequency of insulin-dependent diabetes was pointed out in patients-- 28% of those who were first diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma. Moreover in the same group diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma, we found 17 to have pancreatic carcinoma, and among those there were 12 cases that had diabetes (70.58%).",cancer
"Serum retinol-binding protein-4 levels in polycystic ovary syndrome patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in-vitro fertilization cycle. AIMS: To determine serum retinol-binding rotein 4 (RBP-4) levels in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for an in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycle and the possible correlation to COH variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 11 consecutive PCOS patients undergoing our routine IVF flexible multidose gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-antagonist protocol. Blood was drawn three times during the COH cycle: (1) day 1 or 2 of menstruation, and prior to gonadotropin administration (Day-S) (Day-S); (2) day of or prior to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration (Day-hCG); and (3) day of ovum pick-up (Day-OPU). Levels of estradiol and serum RBP-4 were compared among the three time points. Serum RBP-4 was measured with a commercial immunoassay. RESULTS: Results showed significantly lower levels of serum RBP-4 on Day-OPU and Day-hCG than on Day-S. Though significant correlations were observed between serum RBP-4 and body mass index, fasting glucose or glucose to insulin ratio, no correlations were found between serum RBP-4 and IVF treatment variables or pregnancy rate. CONCLUSION: While serum RBP-4 decreases during COH for IVF, there is apparently no correlation of serum RBP-4 levels with IVF treatment variables or outcome.",cancer
"Groin recurrence following stage IA squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva with negative nodes on superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Stage IA vulvar cancer with a depth of stromal invasion less than 1 mm is generally managed by wide local excision alone since there is less than 1% risk of lymph node involvement. CASE: A 62-year-old patient was admitted to a university hospital with a suspicious vulvar lesion. RESULTS: We present the first case of inguinal node and a possible contralateral pubic ramus recurrence following bilateral superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy and wide local resection for Stage 1A vulvar cancer. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that extended radical surgery provides a better overall survival or reduces recurrence rate in Stage 1A vulvar carcinomas. Conservative vulvar resection and sentinel node dissection seem to be a rational choice. Nevertheless the disease may recur in the inguinal areas and frequently be lethal, therefore close surveillance and early attempts to treat the recurrent disease before infection and inflammation ensues should be the aim of current treatment strategies.",cancer
"Chemotherapy with low-dose bevacizumab and carboplatin in the treatment of a patient with recurrent cervical cancer. Management of patients with recurrent or advanced cervical cancer is a challenge. Concurrent chemotherapy has become the mainstay of treatment and platinum remains the most effective single agent. Combinations of other agents have not demonstrated significant advantages. The application of angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab, an antibody inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor, in metastatic or advanced cervical cancer remains to be evaluated. We present the case of a patient with platinum-resistant recurrent cervical cancer treated with low-dose bevacizumab and carboplatin, with resultant improved disease progression and tolerable toxicity profiles.",cancer
"Serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma incidentally discovered in a 29-year-old patient: case report. This is a review of a case of Stage I A serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma in a 29-year-old patient. The patient had no symptoms of illness. She underwent a surgical intervention because of cysts in both of her ovaries. By histopathological examination of the tissue sample taken during the surgical intervention, it was discovered that the patient suffered from a serous cystadenocarcinoma in her left ovary. Five years after the surgical intervention there have been no symptoms of relapse.",cancer
"Ovarian carcinomatosis presenting as bilateral inguinal hernia: a brief report. The differential diagnosis for what may seem an inguinal hernia may be complex, as lateral pain may be of many types of origin. We report the case of a 48-year-old female patient who presented with a history of painful, progressively protruding soft bulging masses over the bilateral inguinal area and a 20-year history of head cancer and hepatitis B virus. Pathological analysis, gynecological ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography scan were required to make final determination. Final diagnosis was Stage IV ovarian carcinomatosis, which responded to chemotherapy. Initial diagnosis of inguinal hernia should not rule out other potential diagnoses, particularly in complex cases with other risk factors.",cancer
"Liver resection for metastases arising from recurrent granulosa cell tumour of the ovary--a case series. Ovarian granulosa cell tumours (GCT) occur rarely and represent 2-3% of all ovarian tumours. Regarded as tumours with low malignant potential and renowned for late recurrences, these tumours occasionally metastasize to the liver. We present our experience with three patients who underwent secondary cytoreductive surgery including liver resection for recurrence of the disease resulting in greatly improved quality of life and disease-free interval.",cancer
"Ovarian metastasis of a primary renal cell carcinoma: case report and review of literature. Ovarian metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are very rare, with only 23 cases reported in the literature. We report a case of 54-year-old women who developed bilateral ovarian metastasis 39 months after diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was carried out. Subsequently she was treated with sunitinib and her disease stabilized. She is still alive four years after diagnosis of the renal primary, and disease has stabilized on sunitinib. We conclude that, although rare, the possibility of metastatic RCC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of clear cell tumors of the ovary. Due to therapeutic and prognostic implications, it is very important to differentiate if the tumor is a primary ovarian tumor or a metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma. Early diagnosis of this rare metastatic tumor results in prompt treatment and prolonged patient survival.",cancer
Three-dimensional power Doppler color ultrasonographic features of a minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. A case of minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the cervix in a 34-year-old female is presented. The ultrasonographic and three-dimensional power Doppler color studies revealed a nodular cervical lesion with vascularization more prominent in the center of the nodule but also present at the periphery. The imaging diagnosis was suggestive of a myoma but with more vascularization than a conventional one.,cancer
"Metastatic and recurrent adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix: a long-term survival of 16 years. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Recurrent metastatic adenocarcinoma of the cervix is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Treatment options for recurrent disease are limited and cure is extremely rare. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 43-year-old patient with Stage IB adenocarcinoma of the cervix. She had multiple metastatic recurrence episodes salvaged with several radical surgeries, external and intraoperative irradiation, and chemotherapy over a survival period of 16 years. CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term multi-modal salvage treatment may achieve longer survival in rare cases with recurrent metastatic adenocarcinoma of the cervix.",cancer
"A benign metastasizing leiomyoma involving a nodule in the pulmonary artery: case and literature review. Benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) is a rare disease defined as a primary benign uterine tumor with ""metastatic"" lesions preferentially occurring in the lung, pelvis and lymph nodes. There are few reports about local recurrence after initial surgery. We report a case of a BML with local recurrence and metastasis growing into the wall of the left pulmonary artery, diagnosed 11 years after initial hysterectomy. A 55-year-old woman complaining of abdominal discomfort, heaviness and asthenia was admitted to our hospital for investigation of a voluminous uterine mass with high vascularization and three pulmonary nodules. The resection of the mass by laparotomy was complicated by uncontrolled severe hemorrhage due to vascular proliferation, requiring multiple transfusions, packing the cavity and postoperative uterine artery embolization. Three months later the patient underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy with the aim of removing the largest pulmonary nodule, a nodule a located in the lingular branch of the left pulmonary artery. The comparison of hysterectomy and lobectomy pieces showed a similar aspect, leading thus to the diagnosis of BML. Awareness of this rare entity should potentially avoid under-diagnosis and difficulties due to hemorrhage during surgery.",cancer
"Evaluation of preoperative diagnosis with results of histopathological examinations of ovarian tumors in women of reproductive age. Ovarian tumors are the most frequent lesions encountered by gynecologists. Ovarian carcinoma most often develops asymptomatically and until now no sufficient screening diagnostic methods have been developed, which is why various diagnostic methods are being tried concurrently to increase diagnostic sensitivity. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the compliance of the preoperative diagnoses with the results of histopathological examinations of ovarian tumors and to determine the usefulness of simultaneous application of gynecological, ultrasonographic, and Doppler examinations together with determination of CA-125 antigen in the diagnostic process of ovarian tumors. The study comprised a group of 250 women in reproductive age who were operated on for tumors of the ovary. Results of histopathological examinations were compared with the preoperative diagnosis based on the above-mentioned examinations and prognostic indicators: sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive prediction value as well as accuracy were determined. The results showed that combining the four diagnostic methods is a useful research panel in the preoperative diagnostic process of ovarian tumors and makes selecting the appropriate procedure and surgical treatment viable.",cancer
"Intestinal-type metaplasia in the original squamous epithelium of the cervix. There have been a number of reports on cervical carcinomas, both invasive and intraepithelial (CIN III), indicating the presence of intracellular mucins in the absence of glandular differentiation. Yet, the expression of such cells in the normal/original squamous epithelium of the cervix remains unexplored. We investigated the presence of mucin-distended goblet cells at this site, after examining retrospectively normal cervices from 250 hysterectomy specimens. Goblet cells were detected in 3.2% (8/250) of the cervices examined using haematoxylin and eosin stained sections and confirmed by mucin histochemistry: alcian blue (AB) pH 2.5, periodic acid-Schiff reaction with and without diastase digestion (PAS-d, PAS) and the combined AB/PAS. Additional sections were stained with Diazo and Masson-Fontana for argentaffin granules and Grimelius for argyrophil cells, but were all negative and no other cell types were identified. It is believed that this incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia is an acquired change in the cervix, derived from multi-potential stem cells of Mullerian duct origin.",cancer
"Distribution of HPV genotypes in uterine cervical lesions among the Uighur women in Xinjiang province of China. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of HPV genotypes in uterine cervical lesions of Uighur women in the Xinjiang province of China. METHODS: A total of 223 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cervical tissue specimens from Uighur patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were analyzed with HPV specific general primer pairs MY09/11 by PCR amplification and HPV chip. RESULTS: Among 223 cases, HPV-positive samples accounted for 58.7% (131/223). HPV infection rate increased along with the pathological grade of the specimens, with a clear tendency of normal < CIN 1 < CIN 2 < CIN 3 < SCC. HPV16 infection was the predominate one and reached the highest level in SCC with 96%. HPV18 and 58 were detected only in some specimens as a second infection in addition to HPV16. The infection rate and type of HPV was not closely associated with the histological differentiation of the cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: HPV 16 was the most common type detected in Uighur women with SCC and CIN in the Xinjiang area of China. Together with the high infection rate, this may be the reason for the four-fold higher cervical cancer incidence in this province and in this population, when compared to total China. The prevalence of HPV18 and 58 was relatively low.",cancer
"Expression of p16 in serous ovarian neoplasms. PURPOSE: We aimed to examine p16 protein expression in ovarian serous neoplasms along with normal ovarian tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: P16 expression was immunhistochemically evaluated in 86 ovarian serous neoplasms (21 cystadenomas, 20 borderline tumors and 45 carcinomas) and 21 non-neoplastic ovarian tissue. The results were also compared with histopathological grade in serous adenocarcinomas. RESULTS: P16 expression rates for benign, borderline ovarian tumors and ovarian cancer were 14.2%, 85% and 86.6%, respectively. It was significantly higher in carcinomas (p < 0.001) and borderline tumors (p < 0.001) compared to cystadenomas. No immunoreactivity was found in the non-neoplastic ovarian surface epithelial cells. The percentage of p16 expression did not change significantly with histological grade in carcinomas. CONCLUSION: P16 expression is strong and widespread involving most tumor cells in serous papillary ovarian carcinomas, and is probably an early event.",cancer
"Bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin for advanced ovarian cancer: low risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular toxicity. The purpose of this preliminary study was to retrospectively assess the incidence of bowel perforation and hypertension in two separate advanced ovarian cancer patient populations following first-line therapy, comprising paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab. The first 20 patients were treated with six cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2), carboplatin (AUC of 5 i.v.), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg of body weight); q21 days per an independent protocol. The subsequent patients (n = 12) were administered weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2), carboplatin (AUC of 5 i.v.) every four weeks, and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg of body weight) every two weeks for six cycles according to a separate, independent protocol. Bevacizumab was not added to either chemotherapy regimen until cycle 2. In both groups patients who achieved a complete response, partial response or stable disease at the conclusion of induction therapy received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) q21 days as maintenance therapy. A total of 170 cycles (median = 6; range 3-6) of primary induction chemotherapy, 140 of which contained bevacizumab, were administered. Moreover, 206 cycles (median = 9; range 1-12) of maintenance chemotherapy have been delivered to 28 patients thus far. There was no incidence of GI perforation and only two patients demonstrated clinically significant hypertension. Previous studies involving bevacizumab have raised concerns regarding bowel perforations and hypertension. However, we did not encounter difficulties with either of these complications. While we recognize that the risk for bowel perforation remains in the 5-11% range, the study's preliminary results suggest that first-line treatment of advanced stage ovarian carcinoma with bevacizumab can be safely administered.",cancer
"Analysis of clinical and molecular associations of triple negative breast cancers in node-negative patients. INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic modalities in node-negative breast cancer patients remain a matter of controversy. Various prognostic factors have been proposed to help select those patients that would most likely benefit from adjuvant therapy. In view of this notion the triple negative phenotype (hormone receptors and HER2 negative tumors) has gained increasing attention. AIM: To evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics of triple negative (TN) tumors in node-negative invasive breast carcinomas. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the archival pathology tissues of 160 patients with node-negative invasive carcinomas, diagnosed and treated in two surgical departments in Greece from 1999 to 2006. Statistical analysis was used to examine the association between TN tumors and other clinicopathological factors. RESULTS: Triple negative breast cancers correlated with higher histologic grade, mitotic activation index and Ki-67 expression (p < 0.05). Moreover TN tumors were correlated with negative staining for bcl-2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In node-negative breast cancer patients, triple negativity is associated with aggressive biologic behavior. Further studies are required to better understand the clinical implications of these findings.",cancer
"Non-hormonal treatment of vasomotor symptoms in gynecological cancer patients. Gynaecological cancer patients generally suffer from an earlier and more severe menopausal syndrome than the general female population. Hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and there are non-hormonal treatments that are proven to be more effective than placebo in randomized controlled trials, e.g., some antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine. The main limits to the use of these drugs in controlling hot flashes are the off-label use for this purpose, the very short follow-up and the fact that data come from studies performed on breast cancer, not on gynecological cancer patients. Patients believe that drugs derived from plants could be effective in relieving hot flashes and that they are harmless. Evidence is contrary to this belief and estrogen-sensitive cancer patients should be warned of the potential, though very weak, estrogenic effect of phytoestrogens and other ""natural"" drugs, and that their efficacy is close to that of a placebo.",cancer
"Repeated chemosensitivity testing in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is a highly chemosensitive tumor, but most patients with advanced EOC initially responding to first-line chemotherapy will eventually relapse. Chemosensitivity testing may offer an opportunity for the optimal selection of chemotherapeutic agents for individual patients. In the present retrospective analysis we have examined the changes in chemosensitivity profiles during the course of the disease. Chemosensitivity was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test. Two or more samples at least 14 days apart were obtained from 34 patients with ovarian cancer. Chemoresistance increased significantly at the second measurement only for paclitaxel and carboplatin, the most frequently used cytotoxic drugs. No significant difference compared to baseline was observed at subsequent measurements for any other cytotoxic agent studied, although a non-significant trend for increased chemoresistance was observed. In conclusion, in the present cohort only paclitaxel and carboplatin chemosensitivity changed significantly, although to a limited extent, during the course of the disease. In contrast to a limited increase of paclitaxel and carboplatin chemoresistance, no significant changes were observed for other cytotoxic agents examined. The present data indicate that chemoresistance increases, to a modest extent, against the drug most frequently used, but remains relatively stable during the course of disease, especially for agents that are not used in the therapeutic regimen.",cancer
"Increase of Mcm3 and Mcm4 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinomas. PURPOSE: To examine the relevance of expression of two proteins essential for DNA replication initiation, Mcm3 and Mcm4, in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). METHODS: 53 cases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma, 35 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) grade 2-3, 11 CIN I and 26 normal controls were studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-Mcm3 and anti-Mcm4 antibodies. RESULTS: We found Mcm3 and Mcm4 protein expression had a tendency to be stronger from control to CSCC. Both Mcm3 and Mcm4 were significantly upregulated in squamous cervical carcinoma compared to the control, CIN grade 1 and grade 2-3 (p < 0.001), and Mcm3 expression was correlated with CSCC cell differentiation. However there were no independent prognosis correlations between Mcm3 and Mcm4 and clinicopathological parameters including age, stage, tumor size, invasive depth and lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Mcm3 and Mcm4 were highly expressed in CSCC, and these two proteins might be useful as biomolecular markers in clinical diagnosis.",cancer
Liquid based cytology improves the positive predictive value of glandular smears compared to conventional cytology. PURPOSE: To investigate whether the introduction of liquid-based cytology (LBC) in an urban setting decreases the diagnosis of glandular neoplasia (grade 6) and improves the positive predictive value (PPV) of cervical cytological screening. METHODS: A retrospective database review was conducted identifying women with cervical cytological abnormalities including glandular neoplasia (grade 6) before and after the introduction of LBC. RESULTS: Following the introduction of LBC the rate of glandular neoplasia (grade 6) referrals fell from 1.08% to 0.69% of all cervical cytological abnormalities. There was a significant reduction in 'abnormal' cytological samples subsequently found to be associated with no invasive or preinvasive disease but no decrease in the number showing preinvasive or invasive disease. A significant decrease in number of patients having a final diagnosis of normal/inflammatory or wart changes was seen in those patients referred during the LBC period (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The introduction of LBC in an urban setting decreased cytological glandular neoplasia referrals but not at the expense of missing preinvasive and invasive cancers. It has also increased the PPV of cervical sampling to detect preinvasive and invasive cancer from 59.6% to 76.0%.,cancer
"A comparison of outcome in patients with stage 1 clear cell and grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with and without adjuvant therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcomes in patients with Stage I uterine clear cell carcinoma (UCCC) treated with and without adjuvant therapy, and to compare the outcomes in these patients to that of matched controls, patients with Stage I, grade 3, endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (EC). METHODS: Patients with FIGO Stage I UCCC who underwent comprehensive surgical staging between January 1996 and January 2007 were identified. Cases (UCCC) were matched by age, stage, adjuvant therapy, and year of diagnosis to controls consisting of patients with grade 3 EC. Recurrence and survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 25 patients with Stage I UCCC were identified of whom 13 (52%) received no adjuvant therapy and 12 (48%) received adjuvant radiation therapy (XRT). The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates for the observation and the XRT groups were 78% and 75%, (p = 0.7) and 85% and 82% (p = 0.1), respectively. When compared to controls, the 5-year disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates of patients with Stage I UCCC were not significantly different, 77% vs 75% (p = 0.8) and 84% vs 88% (p = 0.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Stage I UCCC tumors there was no clear benefit to adjuvant radiation given the absence of improvement in recurrence risk or any survival benefit. These data question the benefit of radiation therapy in UCCC patients with disease confined to the uterus.",cancer
"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-type distribution in relation to oral contraceptive use in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, Durban, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To determine HPV-type distribution among women with cervical dysplasia in relation to oral contraceptive usage. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study of four groups of patients according to oral contraceptive usage: non-users, users of less than five years duration, users of between five years and ten years, and users of more than ten years duration. Swabs of the cervix were analysed for HPV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: A total of 124 women were recruited for the study. There were 75 patients who were HIV-infected (seroprevalence 61%). There were 102 patients who were HPV positive (82%), of which 79 patients had high-risk HPV DNA (78%). In terms of the four oral contraceptive groups, high-risk HPV DNA was detected in 70% (n = 21), 79% (n = 22), 90% (n = 21) and 71% (n = 15) of patient, respectively. The odds of having HPV DNA was six times higher for the combination of contraceptive users of less than five years duration/non-users (OR 5.9, 95% CI: 1.87-18.77). There was no change when adjustment was made for age (OR 6.1, 95% CI: 1.9-19.4). HPV DNA type 16 and/or 18 was present in a total of 21 patients (49%) (non-contraceptive users and users < 5 years duration) versus 15 patients (42%) (oral contraceptive users of more than 5 years duration) (p = 0.524). HPV type 16 was the commonest HPV type detected (20.2%) and HPV type 58 was the next commonest hihg-risk HPV type (16.1%). HPV types 58 and 33 were detected in a much greater percentage of our population and HPV 16 in a much smaller percentage of our population compared with a non-South African population. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate an interesting distribution of HPV types in a South African population.",cancer
"Molecular markers in epithelial ovarian cancer: their role in prognosis and therapy. Epithelial cancer of the ovary is the most lethal malignancy of all gynaecological cancers. Various clinical and pathological features of ovarian cancer are used as predictors of clinical outcome. The use of molecular markers in common clinical practice seems promising for the diagnosis and prognostication. The aim of this review article is to describe current theories regarding the pathogenesis and molecular evolution of epithelial ovarian cancer. With respect to the molecules involved, this article focuses on whether they are associated with poor prognosis or not. This evaluation is performed in light of the progress made and the potential usefulness in treatment decisions without overlooking existing controversies that should be further studied. It is tempting to anticipate the gradual integration of molecular profiling in clinical practice.",cancer
"Hormone therapy/adjuvant chemotherapy induced deleterious effects on the bone mass of breast cancer patients and the intervention of physiotherapy: a literature review. In recent years, breast cancer has witnessed some notable improvements regarding early diagnosis and new therapeutical strategies, mainly because of the utilization of new drugs and systemic treatment protocols, which have had a direct impact in the increase of these patients' global survival rate. At the same time, it is an ever-growing concern among oncology professionals to identify and minimize as much as possible the effects of long-term toxicity resulting from cancer therapies. Within this context, physiotherapy fits as a preventive and rehabilitating factor regarding functional and skeletal alterations, deriving not only from the direct action of breast cancer, but also from the treatment to which these patients are submitted. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to revise the scientific literature on possible adjuvant chemotherapy-induced secondary deleterious effects on the bone mass of patients diagnosed with breast cancer, and also to revise the literature on the intervention of physiotherapy in cases of secondary bone mass loss caused by adjuvant chemotherapy in patients suffering from breast cancer. METHODOLOGY: The research was carried out by consulting the following medical websites: Medicus Medline Index, Lilacs, Sciello, PubMed (National Library of Medicine), Google Academic and Capes (a Brazilian website for scientific information). The selection gathers articles written in different languages, English in special, published from January 1998 to October 2008. RESULTS: 24 studies explicitly mention chemotherapy-induced direct and/or indirect effects upon bone mass. Different authors refer to bone mass loss as one possible secondary deleterious effect resulting from adjuvant chemotherapy applied in breast cancer treatment. Nonetheless, no scientific articles were found on the subject of physiotherapy intervention aimed at patients in this specific condition. CONCLUSION: The results achieved in this revision study point out the possible chemotherapy-induced late deleterious effects on patients diagnosed with breast cancer, as well as the additional risks for the development of further osteoporotic conditions. Hormone therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy treatments may in fact augment and accelerate the loss of bone mass, be it directly, through the action of chemotherapeutical drugs, or indirectly, through the reduction of estrogenic levels and precocious menopause. The scarce material on the rehabilitation of bone mass loss deriving from adjuvant treatments reveals, as it seems, a strong need for new studies on the subject.",cancer
"Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy added to the treatment of ovarian cancer. A review of achieved results and complications. OBJECTIVE: The late revelation of ovarian cancer ensures it as the leading cause of death among gynecologic cancers. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy have been the cornerstone for a long time to treat this disease. More recently, the modality of intraperitoneal administration of chemotherapy under hyperthermic conditions (HIPEC) has been added. This review surveys the results of HIPEC added to CRS in ovarian cancer. METHODS: A multi-database search was conducted focusing on mortality, morbidity and overall and disease-free (DF) survival rates. RESULTS: 16 studies were identified reporting the results of CRS followed by HIPEC of 546 patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Postoperative mortality was reported for 14 out of 481 patients in total (2.9%). The major morbidity rate varied between 3.4 and 50.0%. In all but one study (533 patients), 185 events were reported (34.5%) and 21 re-interventions after 476 operations (4.4%). Survival data ranged from 10.0 to 57.1 months for the DF survival and from 19.0 to 76.1 months for the overall survival. Optimal cytoreduction and recurrent disease were associated with a better outcome in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Adding HIPEC to the current treatment modalities for ovarian cancer seems to be feasible. Improved survival rates have been reported at the cost of acceptable mortality rates. Nevertheless, there was a selection bias, the morbidity should not be underestimated and it is unclear yet which patient will benefit most from this treatment. Randomized controlled trials will provide an answer to this question.",cancer
"Could the eventual results of the NSABP* 39/RTOG** 0413 trial for partial breast irradiation (PBI) be improved by combining spherical applicators and whole breast irradiation? Radiobiology suggests it may. There may be unacceptable risks associated with the relatively large single doses of irradiation prescribed over five days instead of over six weeks for three of the four trial arms of the NSABP39/RTOG 0413 clinical trial seeking to enlist 4,300 patients. The first arm prescribes 60 Gray (Gy) in two Gy fractions over six weeks, which is the present standard. The dose implications of the other three arms with reference to this standard were examined using the ID2 formalism. Particularly poor (non-homogeneous) dose distributions characterise spherical applicators like ""MammoSite"" used as a sole device for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). The alternative treatment, APBI done by 3-D conformal radiation, may also have a drawback, namely a sudden sharp cut-off in dose which may cause cosmetic problems due to circumscribed fibrosis and edema. Some recently published results from this trial reveal an alarming level of complications. The possible causes of these complications and poor cosmetic outcomes and how to avoid them are examined. An obstacle to the more widespread use of the ""MammoSite type of device is that the device is not allowed closer than 5-7 mm from the skin or ribs; a possible remedy for this restriction is offered. It is also intended to make the relevant radiobiological principles usable for surgical oncologists.",cancer
"Therapeutic choices for curing dysodia?...three clinical cases. These three clinical cases provide an approach to the management of anatomical voice disorders. When confronted with a laryngeal diagnosis, talented musicians often suffer a crisis of self-confidence which may propel them toward maladaptive compensations; these may destabilize their usual techniques, already disrupted by the changes in their vocal acoustics. In their forties, each of these patients presents with an angiomatous lesion of the vocal fold, associated in two of the cases with a congenital structural weakness. For the three of them, the recommended therapeutic choice was alternating recorded laryngoscopic follow-up, alternative medicine prescriptions, and ""artistic sessions"" that required that their phoniatrician adapt to their repertory, their temperament, the constraints of the stage and their laryngeal disorder in order that they achieve a compromise between the needs of their career and the laryngeal anatomic realities of the moment. These ""artistic guidance sessions"" are recorded so as to allow the patient to become aware of the quality of their public performance and to learn the functional elements contributing to it.",cancer

"Phenotypic heterogeneity among tumorigenic melanoma cells from patients that is reversible and not hierarchically organized. We investigated whether melanoma is hierarchically organized into phenotypically distinct subpopulations of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells or whether most melanoma cells retain tumorigenic capacity, irrespective of their phenotype. We found 28% of single melanoma cells obtained directly from patients formed tumors in NOD/SCID IL2Rgamma(null) mice. All stage II, III, and IV melanomas obtained directly from patients had common tumorigenic cells. All tumorigenic cells appeared to have unlimited tumorigenic capacity on serial transplantation. We were unable to find any large subpopulation of melanoma cells that lacked tumorigenic potential. None of 22 heterogeneously expressed markers, including CD271 and ABCB5, enriched tumorigenic cells. Some melanomas metastasized in mice, irrespective of whether they arose from CD271(-) or CD271(+) cells. Many markers appeared to be reversibly expressed by tumorigenic melanoma cells.",cancer
"FoxOs enforce a progression checkpoint to constrain mTORC1-activated renal tumorigenesis. mTORC1 is a validated therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, analysis of Tsc1-deficient (mTORC1 hyperactivation) mice uncovered a FoxO-dependent negative feedback circuit constraining mTORC1-mediated renal tumorigenesis. We document robust FoxO activation in Tsc1-deficient benign polycystic kidneys and FoxO extinction on progression to murine renal tumors; murine renal tumor progression on genetic deletion of both Tsc1 and FoxOs; and downregulated FoxO expression in most human renal clear cell and papillary carcinomas, yet continued expression in less aggressive RCCs and benign renal tumor subtypes. Mechanistically, integrated analyses revealed that FoxO-mediated block operates via suppression of Myc through upregulation of the Myc antagonists, Mxi1-SRalpha and mir-145, establishing a FoxO-Mxi1-SRalpha/mir-145 axis as a major progression block in renal tumor development.",cancer
"B55beta-associated PP2A complex controls PDK1-directed myc signaling and modulates rapamycin sensitivity in colorectal cancer. The PP2A serine/threonine protein phosphatase serves as a critical cellular regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. However, how this pathway is altered in human cancer to confer growth advantage is largely unknown. Here, we show that PPP2R2B, encoding the B55beta regulatory subunit of the PP2A complex, is epigenetically inactivated by DNA hypermethylation in colorectal cancer. B55beta-associated PP2A interacts with PDK1 and modulates its activity toward Myc phosphorylation. On loss of PPP2R2B, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin triggers a compensatory Myc phosphorylation in PDK1-dependent, but PI3K and AKT-independent manner, resulting in resistance. Reexpression of PPP2R2B, genetic ablation of PDK1 or pharmacologic inhibition of PDK1 abrogates the rapamycin-induced Myc phosphorylation, leading to rapamycin sensitization. Thus, PP2A-B55beta antagonizes PDK1-Myc signaling and modulates rapamycin sensitivity.",cancer
"Hdac3 is essential for the maintenance of chromatin structure and genome stability. Hdac3 is essential for efficient DNA replication and DNA damage control. Deletion of Hdac3 impaired DNA repair and greatly reduced chromatin compaction and heterochromatin content. These defects corresponded to increases in histone H3K9,K14ac; H4K5ac; and H4K12ac in late S phase of the cell cycle, and histone deposition marks were retained in quiescent Hdac3-null cells. Liver-specific deletion of Hdac3 culminated in hepatocellular carcinoma. Whereas HDAC3 expression was downregulated in only a small number of human liver cancers, the mRNA levels of the HDAC3 cofactor NCOR1 were reduced in one-third of these cases. siRNA targeting of NCOR1 and SMRT (NCOR2) increased H4K5ac and caused DNA damage, indicating that the HDAC3/NCOR/SMRT axis is critical for maintaining chromatin structure and genomic stability.",cancer
"Recombinant human erythropoietin antagonizes trastuzumab treatment of breast cancer cells via Jak2-mediated Src activation and PTEN inactivation. We found that the receptor for erythropoietin (EpoR) is coexpressed with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) in a significant percentage of human breast tumor specimens and breast cancer cell lines. Exposure of HER2 and EpoR dual-positive breast cancer cells to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) activated cell signaling. Concurrent treatment of the cells with rHuEPO and trastuzumab reduced the cells' response to trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. We identified Jak2-mediated activation of Src and inactivation of PTEN as underlying mechanisms through which rHuEPO antagonizes trastuzumab-induced therapeutic effects. Furthermore, we found that compared with administration of trastuzumab alone, concurrent administration of rHuEPO and trastuzumab correlated with shorter progression-free and overall survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.",cancer
"Aberrant epigenetic landscape in cancer: how cellular identity goes awry. Appropriate patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications are required to assure cell identity, and their deregulation can contribute to human diseases, such as cancer. Our aim here is to provide an overview of how epigenetic factors, including genomic DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA regulation, contribute to normal development, paying special attention to their role in regulating tissue-specific genes. In addition, we summarize how these epigenetic patterns go awry during human cancer development. The possibility of ""resetting"" the abnormal cancer epigenome by applying pharmacological or genetic strategies is also discussed.",cancer
"Development of ipilimumab: contribution to a new paradigm for cancer immunotherapy. Identification of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) as a key negative regulator of T-cell activity led to development of the fully human, monoclonal antibody ipilimumab to block CTLA-4 and potentiate antitumor T-cell responses. Animal studies first provided insight into the ability of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody to cause tumor regression, particularly in combination regimens. Early clinical studies defined ipilimumab pharmacokinetics and possibilities for combinability. Phase II trials of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma showed objective responses, but a greater number of patients had disease stabilization. In a phase III trial, ipilimumab was the first agent to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival in patients with previously treated, advanced melanoma. The adverse event profile associated with ipilimumab was primarily immune-related. Adverse events can be severe and life-threatening, but most were reversible using treatment guidelines. Ipilimumab monotherapy exhibits conventional and new patterns of activity in advanced melanoma, with a delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The observation of some new response patterns with ipilimumab, which are not captured by standard response criteria, led to novel criteria for the evaluation of immunotherapy in solid tumors. Overall, lessons from the development of ipilimumab contributed to a new clinical paradigm for cancer immunotherapy evolved by the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.",cancer
"Signaling through OX40 enhances antitumor immunity. The existence of tumor-specific T cells, as well as their ability to be primed in cancer patients, confirms that the immune response can be deployed to combat cancer. However, there are obstacles that must be overcome to convert the ineffective immune response commonly found in the tumor environment to one that leads to sustained destruction of tumor. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily direct diverse immune functions. OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are key TNF members that augment T-cell expansion, cytokine production, and survival. OX40 signaling also controls regulatory T-cell differentiation and suppressive function. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated that OX40 agonists enhance antitumor immunity in preclinical models using immunogenic tumors; however, treatment of poorly immunogenic tumors has been less successful. Combining strategies that prime tumor-specific T cells together with OX40 signaling could generate and maintain a therapeutic antitumor immune response.",cancer
"Biology and clinical applications of CD40 in cancer treatment. CD40 is a costimulatory molecule widely expressed by immune cells and by neoplastic cells of different histotypes. Engagement of surface CD40 mediates different effects depending on cell type and microenvironment. In particular, CD40 expression on immune cells regulates humoral and cellular immunity, while it has apoptotic and antiproliferative activity on selected neoplastic cells. Thus, CD40 targeting may indirectly affect tumor growth through the activation of immune cells and/or directly by mediating cytotoxic effects on neoplastic cells. Preliminary findings emerging from clinical trials indicate that antibodies to CD40 can induce immune modulation and clinical responses in cancer patients.",cancer
"Clinical experiences with anti-CD137 and anti-PD1 therapeutic antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide a pharmacological platform to block or activate the function of surface receptors. The immune system has evolved receptor-ligand pairs that repress or empower the cellular immune response, which, if tampered with, unleash more potent cellular immunity against tumor antigens. Agonist antibodies directed against CD137 (4-1BB) on the surface of antigen-primed T lymphocytes increase tumor immunity that is curative against some transplantable murine tumors. A fully human IgG4 anti-CD137 antibody is under development with signs of clinical activity and cases of severe liver toxicity that seem to be on-target and dose-dependent effects. Programmed death-1 (PD1) is a surface molecule delivering inhibitory signals important to maintain T-cell functional silence against their cognate antigens. Interference with PD1 or its ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) increases antitumor immunity. As a result anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 human mAbs are under clinical development. Phase I trials with anti-PD1 mAb have yielded encouraging results with durable objective responses and a reasonable safety profile. As new class of drugs in cancer therapy, immunostimulatory mAbs have resulted in redefinition of tumor response criteria and rethinking of the rationale for combining these among each other and with other strategies.",cancer
"The emerging toxicity profiles of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies across clinical indications. The promising new class of immunomodulating antibodies directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) has been extensively tested in clinical trials and found to be active against cutaneous melanoma and other tumor histotypes. Inhibition of CTLA-4 characteristically induces well-identified side effects for which the definition ""immune-related adverse events"" (irAEs) has been proposed. IrAEs mainly include colitis/diarrhea, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies; uveitis, nephritis, and inflammatory myopathy also have been reported occasionally. These unique side effects are likely a direct result of breaking immune tolerance upon CTLA-4 blockade and are generally mild, reversible, and manageable, following specific treatment guidelines that include symptomatic therapies or systemic corticosteroids. However, patient-physician communication and early treatment are also emerging as critical issues to successfully manage irAEs, thus avoiding major complications. The major experience in identifying and managing CTLA-4 treatment-related side effects has derived from studies in melanoma patients; nevertheless, accumulating clinical experiences are clearly demonstrating that irAEs are class-specific events, and that they are fully overlapping in patients with tumors of different histotypes. This review provides an overview of current safety data on CTLA-4 antagonists and of available strategies to optimize their clinical use in cancer patients.",cancer
"Update on immunologic therapy with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in melanoma: identification of clinical and biological response patterns, immune-related adverse events, and their management. Immune-modifying monoclonal antibodies may induce or enhance the natural immune response against tumor cells. The complex interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes as an immune response is strongly affected by anti-CD152 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, CTLA-4)-antibodies. However, specific CTLA-4 antibodies can block the CTLA-4 receptor and thus induce an unrestrained T-cell activation. To this stage, treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with the CTLA-4 antibodies ipilimumab and tremelimumab has only been investigated within clinical trials. The results of a phase III trial in patients with advanced disease treated with ipilimumab alone or in combination with a peptide vaccination (gp100) recently presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the Ameircan Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) made groundbreaking news as ipilimumab was demonstrated to be the first drug in melanoma treatment to show a significant prolongation of survival time. Patients undergoing treatment with CTLA-4 antibodies may experience immune-related phenomena and adverse events (irAEs) that differ greatly from the well-known adverse events of cytotoxic drugs and which are due to the CTLA-4 antibodies' specific mode of action. This review gives a condensed overview on the mechanisms of action, an update on clinical data of the two CTLA-4 antibodies, ipilimumab and tremelimumab, and detailed recommendations for adverse event management strategies.",cancer
"Anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy: immune monitoring during clinical development of a novel immunotherapy. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4), also known as CD152, is a co-inhibitory molecule that functions to regulate T-cell activation. Antibodies that block the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2 can enhance immune responses, including antitumor immunity. Two CTLA-4-blocking antibodies are presently under clinical investigation: ipilimumab and tremelimumab. CTLA-4 blockade has shown promise in treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, with a recently completed randomized, double-blind phase III trial demonstrating a benefit in overall survival (OS) in the treated population. However, this approach appears to benefit only a subset of patients. Understanding the mechanism(s) of action of CTLA-4 blockade and identifying prognostic immunologic correlates of clinical endpoints to monitor are presently areas of intense investigation. Several immunologic endpoints have been proposed to correlate with clinical activity. This review will focus on the endpoints of immune monitoring described in studies to date and discuss future areas of additional work needed.",cancer
"Brain metastasis in melanoma: clinical activity of CTLA-4 antibody therapy. Melanoma metastasizes frequently to the brain, and brain metastases generally drive the prognosis of melanoma patients. Surgical and radiation therapy improve the outcome of selected melanoma patients with brain metastasis, while systemic treatment using cytotoxic agents still plays a limited role. Temozolomide and fotemustine are preferentially used in melanoma patients with brain metastases in the United States and in Europe, respectively, with modest clinical activity. However, the results obtained with either agent are still limited, and efforts are needed to improve the outcome of these patients who are generally excluded from clinical trials. Among therapeutic agents in development, antibodies that block the interaction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2 and thus enhance antitumor immune responses have shown clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, including durable control of brain metastases. This chapter reviews the current data and the rationale for ongoing and future trials of combination cytotoxic plus immunomodulatory therapy by US and Italian multicenter trial groups.",cancer
"Clinical studies with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in non-melanoma indications. Available medical treatments have limited impact on the survival of patients with advanced cancer; therefore, new therapeutic strategies able to generate more effective host's immune responses against neoplastic cells are being actively pursued. Among these, a recent approach involves targeting of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), a key immune checkpoint molecule, by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Ipilimumab and tremelimumab represent the prototypes of this new class of immunomodulating mAb and have been extensively tested in metastatic melanoma with highly promising results. The clinical activity observed in melanoma has served as a model to exploit the therapeutic potential of CTLA-4 blockade in a variety of human malignancies. Along this line, early-phase trials with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs have been completed or are ongoing in tumors of different histotype. Results are demonstrating the feasibility, safety, and activity of these agents, thus suggesting a promising therapeutic role to be further investigated in phase II/III trials in a wide range of tumors. This review summarizes the main trials with ipilimumab and tremelimumab in tumors of different histotypes, excluding cutaneous melanoma, which is extensively described in other chapters of this issue of Seminars in Oncology.",cancer
"Anti-CTLA-4 antibody adjuvant therapy in melanoma. Thus far the development of adjuvant therapies in melanoma has suffered greatly from the lack of effective drugs in stage IV melanoma. Chemotherapy, cytokines, vaccines, and combinations of drugs have been used with minimal success. This has led to adjuvant therapies that are not used uniformly or widely because of the rather marginal benefits, as no consistent and clinically significant impact on survival has been demonstrated. A new development for interferon-based adjuvant therapy seems to be the observation that better effects are observed in patients with lower tumor load and in patients with an ulcerated primary melanoma. A benefit for patients with more advanced lymphnodal involvement is quite unsure, clearly requiring new drugs to be explored. A new era in the treatment of melanoma treatment has arrived with the anti-cytoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies. The randomized trial in advanced metastatic melanoma demonstrated a clear benefit with prolongation of survival. The anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab has finally changed the landscape. It is therefore only logical that a worldwide adjuvant trial with ipilimumab versus placebo, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18071, is ongoing in patients with lymph node metastases, and that another adjuvant trial with ipilimumab compared to high-dose interferon (HDI) is planned in the United States. The EORTC 18071 trial will reach full accrual in 2011 and thus results are expected in 2013 or 2014.",cancer
"Clinical development of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab. Tremelimumab (formerly CP-675,206) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody tested in patients with cancer, of whom the majority have had metastatic melanoma. Clinical trials using tremelimumab demonstrate that this antibody can induce durable tumor regressions (up to 8 years at this time) in 7% to 10% of patients with metastatic melanoma. These tumor responses are mediated by the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as demonstrated in patient-derived tumor biopsies. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the range of 20% to 25% are mainly inflammatory or autoimmune in nature, which are on-target effects after inhibiting CTLA-4-mediated self-tolerance. The lack of survival advantage in the early analysis of a phase III clinical trial comparing tremelimumab with standard chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma highlights the importance of gaining a better understanding of how this antibody modulates the human immune system and how to better select patients for this mode of therapy.",cancer
"Ipilimumab: unleashing the power of the immune system through CTLA-4 blockade. Malignant melanoma is rising faster in incidence than any other malignancy. Long-term remission or ""cure"" is rare and is almost exclusively limited to therapies that stimulate an immune antitumor response. Ipilimumab is a novel targeted human immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen4 (CTLA-4), an immune-inhibitory site expressed on activated T cells. Ipilimumab is well tolerated as an outpatient infusion therapy. Multiple studies have confirmed significant antimelanoma activity. A randomized trial has documented a survival benefit when ipilimumab was compared to a gp-100 vaccine only arm. The unique mechanism of action of ipilimumab makes assessment of response by conventional criteria difficult. Benefit from ipilimumab can occur after what would be considered progression with World Health Oganization (WHO) or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. New immune response criteria have been proposed. Therapeutic responses peak between 12 and 24 weeks, with slow responses continuing up to and beyond 12 months. The major drug- related adverse side effects (10%-15% grade 3 or above) are immune-related and consist most commonly of rash, colitis, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and hepatitis. Colonic perforation can occur and patients with diarrhea have to be monitored carefully with strict adherence to treatment algorithms. Algorithms for the treatment of other adverse side effects have been developed. The treatment of immune-related side effects with immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids, does not appear to impair antitumor response. With proper monitoring and management of side effects, ipilimumab is an extremely safe drug to administer. The benefits of ipilimumab will most certainly extend to other malignancies in the near future.",cancer
"Predictive value of CD24 and CD44 for neoadjuvant chemotherapy response and prognosis in primary breast cancer patients. PURPOSE: We investigated the significance of CD24 and CD44 expression for predicting responses to chemotherapy and prognosis in primary breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnosis of breast cancer was confirmed by core needle biopsy, and immunohistochemical studies were performed. Preoperatively, patients received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Expression of CD44 and CD24 was assessed immunohistochemically and the relationship with chemotherapy response and with prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2004, 139 women were enrolled in this study. In the correlation analysis, CD24 expression was negatively associated with pathological response to chemotherapy (p = 0.0003). A machine learning technique with an alternating decision tree (ADTree) showed that four logical rules are involved in predicting the response depending on the combination of CD24, HER2, tumor stage, CD44, progesterone receptor, and patient age. In the survival analysis, patients having CD44 (++) showed a significantly favorable prognosis as compared with others (p = 0.0002). A multivariate analysis showed that CD44 expression had an independent prognostic value (p < .0001). CONCLUSION: We found a significant correlation between CD44 expression and prognosis and between CD24 expression and response to chemotherapy. CD24 and CD44 expressions would be useful predictive markers, although further studies are needed.",cancer
"HER-2/neu cytoplasmic staining is correlated with neuroendocrine differentiation in breast carcinoma. HER2 oncoprotein plays an essential role in breast cancer growth and differentiation. Determination of HER2 status contributes not only to predicting survival but also to selecting the patients for anti-HER2 therapy. HER2 protein expressed in human cancer cells often contains variant forms as well as the full-length wild-type form. In the present study, we investigated the subcellular localization of HER2 protein in 1053 primary breast cancer tissues. HER2 protein was stained by various immunohistochemical methods and studied by immunoelectron microscopy to confirm the intracellular localization. Thirty-four of 1053 specimens showed cytoplasmic staining of the intracellular domain of HER2 protein by the HercepTest and CB-11. In contrast, no immunoreactivity to the antibodies against the extracellular domain was observed. None of the 34 specimens showed amplification of the HER2 protein by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Subsequently, we studied the association of the cytoplasmic expression of HER2 with neuroendocrine differentiation. Interestingly, all 34 specimens had some positive signals of neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, and CD56. Although the result is preliminary, it warrants further study on the role of the cytoplasmic variant form of HER2 in breast cancer growth, particularly in the aspect of neuroendocrine differentiation.",cancer
"Irradiation-induced p53 expression is attenuated in cells with NQO1 C465T polymorphism. NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO) 1 polymorphism is associated with various hematological malignancies, especially infant leukemia or therapy-related leukemias, which involve the rearrangement of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) with either of 2 well known polymorphic variations of C609T and C465T were selected from our archives of EBV-LCL clones and studied the induction of p53 expression after DNA damage. Irradiation of cells with C609T/C609T polymorphism (NQO1 *2*2) did not affect the induction of p53 expression. However, irradiation of cells with C465T/WT polymorphism (NQO1 *1*3) resulted in attenuation of p53 and p21 induction. Our results suggest that increased risk of infant leukemia development in patients with NQO1 *1*3 polymorphism is partially dependent on the inhibition of p53 pathway, though further studies are needed to fully understand the pathological role of C465T variant in the development of childhood leukemia.",cancer
"McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS): early and extensive bone fibrous dysplasia involvement and ""mistaken identity"" oophorectomy. BACKGROUND: McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a triad of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (GIPP), cafe-au-lait spots (CALS) and fibrous dysplasia (FD) of bone. The extent of the abnormalities is variable. PATIENT AND RESULTS: We report a 3 year old girl with CALS since infancy, FD diagnosed at age of 2.5 years, and at the age of 3 years vaginal bleeding. The ultrasound revealed a cystic mass of the ovary, surgical pathology found ovarian cyst. LHRH stimulation demonstrated GIPP (LH 9.8 mIU/ml and FSH 8.9 mIU/ml; normal LH 1.8-10, FSH 9-26 mIU/ml). Radiographs and bone scans demonstrated FD in multiple bones. Peripheral leucocytes and the ovary were negative for GNAS gene mutations. Treatment with Letrasole interrupted the pubertal development. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the clinical signs of MAS are telling and that timely MAS diagnosis prevents unnecessary oophorectomy. A close follow up is recommended regarding development of endocrine disorders and spreading of FD.",cancer

"Use of pathway information in molecular epidemiology. Candidate gene studies are generally motivated by some form of pathway reasoning in the selection of genes to be studied, but seldom has the logic of the approach been carried through to the analysis. Marginal effects of polymorphisms in the selected genes, and occasionally pairwise gene-gene or gene-environment interactions,are often presented, but a unified approach to modelling the entire pathway has been lacking. In this review, a variety of approaches to this problem is considered, focusing on hypothesis-driven rather than purely exploratory methods. Empirical modelling strategies are based on hierarchical models that allow prior knowledge about the structure of the pathway and the various reactions to be included as 'prior covariates'. By contrast, mechanistic models aim to describe the reactions through a system of differential equations with rate parameters that can vary between individuals, based on their genotypes. Some ways of combining the two approaches are suggested and Bayesian model averaging methods for dealing with uncertainty about the true model form in either framework is discussed. Biomarker measurements can be incorporated into such analyses, and two-phase sampling designs stratified on some combination of disease, genes and exposures can be an efficient way of obtaining data that would be too expensive or difficult to obtain on a full candidate gene sample. The review concludes with some thoughts about potential uses of pathways in genome-wide association studies.",cancer
"Platelets: linking hemostasis and cancer. Platelets are the main cellular component in blood responsible for maintaining the integrity of the cardiovascular system via hemostasis. Platelet dysfunction contributes to a wide range of obvious pathological conditions, such as bleeding or thrombosis, but normal platelet function is also linked to diseases not immediately associated with hemostasis or thrombosis, such as cancer. Since the description of Trousseau syndrome in 1865, various experimental and clinical studies have detailed the interaction of platelets with primary tumors and circulating metastatic tumor cells. Observations have suggested that platelets not only augment the growth of primary tumors via angiogenesis but endow tumor cells physical and mechanical support to evade the immune system and extravasate to secondary organs, the basis of metastatic disease. Many laboratory and animal studies have identified specific targets for antiplatelet therapy that may be advantageous as adjuncts to existing cancer treatments. In this review, we summarize important platelet properties that influence tumorigenesis, including primary tumor growth and metastasis at the molecular level. The studies provide a link between the well-studied paradigms of platelet hemostasis and tumorigenesis.",cancer
"The contribution of Langerhans cells to cutaneous malignancy.

The skin is a highly responsive immunological organ that contains a unique population of immature intraepidermal dendritic cells (DCs) called Langerhans cells (LCs). Although LCs show morphological and migratory changes in response to epidermal perturbation, and can function as antigen-presenting cells to activate T cells, their role in carcinogenesis is unknown. Here we review recent studies that have provided clues to the potential roles that LCs might play in the pathogenesis of skin cancer, beyond their stimulation or regulation of adaptive immunity. Understanding this role of LCs might provide new perspectives on the relevance of DC populations that are resident within other epithelial tissues for cancer.",cancer
"Recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) aided radioiodine treatment for residual or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer. BACKGROUND: For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) following thyroidectomy, thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) for four to six weeks has been used for decades to increase serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in order to enhance iodine-131 uptake by normal thyroid cells and differentiated thyroid tumour cells. Exogenous stimulation with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) offers an alternative to THW while avoiding the morbidity of hypothyroidism. However, the efficacy of rhTSH-aided iodine-131 treatment for residual or metastatic DTC has not been prospectively assessed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of rhTSH-aided radioiodine treatment for normal residual or metastatic DTC. SEARCH STRATEGY: We obtained studies from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (all until November 2009), and paper collections of conferences held in Chinese. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled clinical trials and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing the effects of rhTSH with THW on iodine-131 treatment for residual or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer with at least six months of follow up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Altogether 223 patients with DTC participated in four trials. Overall, studies had a high risk of bias. We found no statistically significant differences between rhTSH and THW treatment in terms of successful ablation rate but significant benefits in radiation exposure to blood and bone marrow. One trial reported on benefits in some domains of health-related quality of life. There were no deaths and no serious adverse effects in DTC patients treated with either rhTSH or THW. Maximum follow up was 12 months. None of the included trials investigated complete or partial remission of metastatic tumour, secondary malignancies or economic outcomes. We did not find sufficient data comparing rhTSH with THW-aided radioiodine treatment for metastatic DTC. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results from four randomised controlled clinical trials suggest that rhTSH is as effective as THW on iodine-131 thyroid remnant ablation, with limited data on significant benefits in decreased whole body radiation exposure and health-related quality of life. It is still uncertain whether lower iodine-131 doses (1110 MBq or 1850 MBq versus 3700 MBq) are equally effective for remnant ablation under rhTSH stimulation. Randomised controlled clinical trials are needed to guide treatment selection for metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.",cancer
"Pharmacological treatments for fatigue associated with palliative care. BACKGROUND: In healthy individuals, fatigue is a protective response to physical or mental stress, often relieved by rest. By contrast, in palliative care patients fatigue can be severely debilitating, thereby impacting daily activity and quality of life, often with rest not counteracting fatigue. Fatigue frequently occurs in patients with advanced disease and modalities treating cancer often contribute or cause fatigue. Further complicating issues are its multidimensionality, subjective nature, and lack of a consensus definition of fatigue. Pathophysiology is not fully understood and evidence-based treatment approaches are needed. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine efficacy of pharmacological treatments on non-specific fatigue in palliative care. The focus was on patients at an advanced stage of disease, including cancer and other chronic diseases associated with fatigue, aiming to relieve fatigue. Studies aiming at curative treatment (e.g. surgical intervention for early breast cancer) were not included. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched EMBASE; Psych Lit, CENTRAL and MEDLINE to June 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning adult palliative care with focus on pharmacological treatment of fatigue. The primary outcome had to be non-specific fatigue (or related terms such as asthenia). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Results were screened and included if they met the selection criteria. If two or more studies were identified that investigated a specific drug in a population with the same disease, meta-analysis was conducted. In addition, comparison of type of drug investigated in a specific population as well as comparison of frequent adverse effects of fatigue treatment was done by creating overview tables. MAIN RESULTS: More than 2000 publications were screened, and 22 met inclusion criteria. In total, data from 11 drugs and 1632 participants were analysed. Studies investigating amantadine, pemoline, and modafinil in participants with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)-associated fatigue and methylphenidate in patients suffering from advanced cancer and fatigue could be used for meta-analysis. Amantadine in MS and methylphenidate in cancer patients showed a superior effect. Most studies had low participant numbers and were heterogenous. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific drug for treatment of fatigue in palliative care patients. Surprisingly, corticosteroids have not been a research focus for fatigue treatment, although these drugs are frequently used. Recent fatigue research seems to focus on modafinil, which may be beneficial although there is no evidence currently. Amantadine and methylphenidate should be further examined. Consensus regarding fatigue assessment in advanced disease is needed.",cancer
"Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: The lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of treatment options for clinically localised prostate cancer continues to impact on clinical decision-making. Two such options are radical prostatectomy (RP) and watchful waiting (WW). WW involves providing no initial treatment and monitoring the patient with the intention of providing palliative treatment if there is evidence of disease progression. OBJECTIVES: To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of RP versus WW for the treatment of localised prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, ISI Science Citation Index, DARE and LILACS were searched through 30 July 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of RP versus WW for clinically localised prostate cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out independently by two authors. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Both trials commenced prior to the widespread availability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; hence the results may not be applicable to men with PSA-detected disease.One trial (N = 142), conducted in the US, was judged to be of poor quality. All cause (overall) mortality was not significantly different between RP and WW groups after fifteen years of follow up (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.43).The second trial (N = 695), conducted in Scandinavia, was judged to be of good quality. After 12 years of follow up, the trial results were compatible with a beneficial effect of RP on the risks of overall mortality, prostate cancer mortality and distant metastases compared with WW but the precise magnitude of the effect is uncertain as indicated by the width of the confidence intervals for all estimates (risk difference (RD) -7.1% (95% CI -14.7 to 0.5); RD -5.4% (95% CI -11.1 to 0.2); RD -6.7% (95% CI -13.2 to -0.2), respectively). Compared to WW, RP increased the absolute risks of erectile dysfunction (RD 35% (95% CI 25 to 45)) and urinary leakage (RD 27% (95% CI 17 to 37)). These estimates must be interpreted cautiously as they are derived from data obtained from a self-administered questionnaire survey of a sample of the trial participants (N = 326), no baseline quality of life data were obtained and nerve-sparing surgery was not routinely performed on trial participants undergoing RP. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The existing trials provide insufficient evidence to allow confident statements to be made about the relative beneficial and harmful effects of RP and WW for patients with localised prostate cancer. The results of ongoing trials should help to inform treatment decisions for men with screen-detected localised prostate cancer.",cancer
"Screening programmes for the early detection and prevention of oral cancer. BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is an important global healthcare problem, its incidence is increasing and late-stage presentation is common. Screening programmes have been introduced for a number of major cancers and have proved effective in their early detection. Given the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with oral cancer, there is a need to determine the effectiveness of a screening programme for this disease, either as a targeted, opportunistic or population based measure. Evidence exists from modelled data that a visual oral examination of high-risk individuals may be a cost-effective screening strategy and the development and use of adjunctive aids and biomarkers is becoming increasingly common. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of current screening methods in decreasing oral cancer mortality. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 20 May 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 20 May 2010), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 20 May 2010) and CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 20 May 2010). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of screening for oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders using visual examination, toluidine blue, fluorescence imaging or brush biopsy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The original review identified 1389 citations and this update identified an additional 330 studies, highlighting 1719 studies for consideration. Only one study met the inclusion criteria and validity assessment, data extraction and statistics evaluation were undertaken by six independent review authors. MAIN RESULTS: One 9-year RCT has been included (n = 13 clusters: 191,873 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in the age-standardised oral cancer mortality rates for the screened group (16.4/100,000 person-years) and the control group (20.7/100,000 person-years). A 43% reduction in mortality was reported between the intervention cohort (29.9/100,000 person-years) and the control arm (45.4/100,000) for high-risk individuals who used tobacco or alcohol or both, which was statistically significant. However, this study had a number of methodological weaknesses and the associated risk of bias was high. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although there is evidence that a visual examination as part of a population based screening programme reduced the mortality rate of oral cancer in high-risk individuals, whilst producing a stage shift and improvement in survival rates across the population as a whole, the evidence is limited to one study and is associated with a high risk of bias. This was compounded by the fact that the effect of cluster randomisation was not accounted for in the analysis. Furthermore, no robust evidence was identified to support the use of other adjunctive technologies like toluidine blue, brush biopsy or fluorescence imaging within a primary care environment. Further randomised controlled trials are recommended to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a visual examination as part of a population based screening programme.",cancer
"Fraction size in radiation treatment for breast conservation in early breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Shortening the duration of radiation therapy would benefit women with early breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery. It may also improve access to radiation therapy by improving efficiency in radiation oncology departments globally. This can only happen if the shorter treatment is as effective and safe as conventional radiation therapy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 3, 2008. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of altered radiation fraction size on outcomes for women with early breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the WHO ICTRP search portal to June 2009, reference lists of articles and relevant conference proceedings. We applied no language constraints. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of unconventional versus conventional fractionation in women with early breast cancer who had undergone breast conserving surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors performed data extraction independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion. We sought missing data from trial authors. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials reported on 7095 women. The women were highly selected: tumours were node negative and 89.8% were smaller than 3 cm. Where the breast size was known, 87% had small or medium breasts. The studies were of low to medium quality. Unconventional fractionation (delivering radiation therapy in larger amounts each day but over fewer days than with conventional fractionation) did not affect: (1) local recurrence risk ratio (RR) 0.97 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.22, P = 0.78), (2) breast appearance RR 1.17 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.39, P = 0.09), (3) survival at five years RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.04, P = 0.16). Acute skin toxicity was decreased with unconventional fractionation: RR 0.21 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.64, P = 0.007). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Two new studies have been published since the last version of the review, altering our conclusions. We have evidence from four low to medium quality randomised trials that using unconventional fractionation regimens (greater than 2 Gy per fraction) does not affect local recurrence, is associated with decreased acute toxicity and does not seem to affect breast appearance or late toxicity for selected women treated with breast conserving therapy. These are mostly women with node negative tumours smaller than 3 cm and negative pathological margins. Long-term follow up (> 5 years) is available for a small proportion of the patients randomised. Longer follow up is required for a more complete assessment of the effect of altered fractionation.",cancer
"Addition of drug/s to a chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer. BACKGROUND: The addition of a chemotherapy drug or drugs to an established regimen is one method used to increase the dose and intensity of treatment for metastatic breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of adding one or more chemotherapy drugs to an established regimen in women with metastatic breast cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (to August 2009) using the codes for ""advanced breast cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"". This review is an update of the original Cochrane Review (Issue 3, 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials with a first line regimen of at least two chemotherapy drugs compared to the same regimen plus the addition of one or more chemotherapy drugs in women with metastatic breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data independently from published trials. We derived hazard ratios (HR) from time-to-event outcomes where possible, and used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. We analysed response rates as dichotomous variables and extracted toxicity data where available. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 trials reporting on 22 treatment comparisons (2674 patients randomised). Fifteen trials (20 treatment comparisons) reported results for tumour response and 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons) published time-to-event data for overall survival. There were 1532 deaths in 2116 women randomised to trials of the addition of a drug to the regimen and control (the regimen alone). There was no detectable difference in overall survival between these patients, with an overall HR of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.07, P = 0.47) and no significant heterogeneity. We found no difference in time to progression between these regimens, with an overall HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, P = 0.31) and no significant heterogeneity. Addition of a drug to the regimen was favourably associated with overall tumour response rates (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, P = 0.04) although we observed significant heterogeneity for this outcome across the trials. Where measured, acute toxicities such as alopecia, nausea and vomiting and leucopenia were more common with the addition of a drug. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The addition of one or more drugs to the regimen shows a statistically significant advantage for tumour response in women with metastatic breast cancer but the results suggest no difference in survival time or time to progression. The positive effect on tumour response was also associated with increased toxicity.",cancer
"Prophylactic mastectomy for the prevention of breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Recent progress in understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer has increased interest in prophylactic mastectomy (PM) as a method of preventing breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: (i) To determine whether prophylactic mastectomy reduces death rates from any cause in women who have never had breast cancer and in women who have a history of breast cancer in one breast, and (ii) to examine the effect of prophylactic mastectomy on other endpoints, including breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality, disease-free survival, physical morbidity, and psychosocial outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2002), MEDLINE and Cancerlit (1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (1974 to June 2006), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal (until June 2006). Studies in English were included. SELECTION CRITERIA: Participants included women at risk for breast cancer in at least one breast. Interventions included all types of mastectomy performed for the purpose of preventing breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors independently abstracted data. Data were summarized descriptively; quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity of study designs and insufficient reporting. Data were analyzed separately for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). MAIN RESULTS: All 39 included studies were observational studies with some methodological limitations; randomized trials were absent. The studies presented data on 7,384 women with a wide range of risk factors for breast cancer who underwent PM.BPM studies on the incidence of breast cancer and/or disease-specific mortality reported reductions after BPM particularly for those with BRCA1/2 mutations. For CPM, studies consistently reported reductions in incidence of contralateral breast cancer but were inconsistent about improvements in disease-specific survival. Only one study attempted to control for multiple differences between intervention groups and this study showed no overall survival advantage for CPM at 15 years. Another study showed significantly improved survival following CPM but after adjusting for bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy, the CPM effect on all-cause mortality was no longer significant.Sixteen studies assessed psychosocial measures; most reported high levels of satisfaction with the decision to have PM but more variable satisfaction with cosmetic results. Worry over breast cancer was significantly reduced after BPM when compared both to baseline worry levels and to the groups who opted for surveillance rather than BPM.Case series reporting on adverse events from PM with or without reconstruction reported rates of unanticipated re-operations from 4% in those without reconstruction to 49% in patients with reconstruction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen studies have been published since the last version of the review, without altering our conclusions. While published observational studies demonstrated that BPM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies (ideally randomized trials) are needed. BPM should be considered only among those at very high risk of disease. There is insufficient evidence that CPM improves survival and studies that control for multiple confounding variables are needed.",cancer
"HPV/cervical cancer vaccination: parental preferences on age, place and information needs. INTRODUCTION: A vaccine against cervical cancer is available in New Zealand through school and primary care for girls aged 12-18 years. Factors that might increase or hinder widespread uptake by the target population need to be identified. AIM: To describe parents' preferences on where their daughter(s) receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, at what age, and their information needs. METHODS: 3123 questionnaires were distributed to parents recruited from 14 schools in 2008, prior to the start of the school-based vaccination programme. Outcome measures were: preferred age and place of vaccination, and information needs of parents and their daughters. Tests for significance were performed to determine whether parental preferences differed by ethnic group (Maori, Pacific, New Zealand European and 'Other'). RESULTS: A 25% response rate was achieved (769/3123). Receipt of the HPV vaccine in a clinic setting was preferred by 40% of parents; 25% preferred vaccination at school. Fifty percent preferred vaccination to occur at age 13 or older; 28% thought ages 10, 11 or 12 appropriate. One in three parents wanted more information and 65% said they would seek information from their family doctor before deciding on the vaccine for their daughter(s). DISCUSSION: We suggest that a programme delivered jointly in primary care and school settings, that is appropriately resourced for follow-up and information-sharing, would increase vaccine coverage. The rationale for vaccination at age 12 needs to be made clear to parents and evidence-based information needs to be delivered appropriately to parents and girls.",cancer
"Paying ""particle"" attention to novel melanoma treatment strategies. Malignant melanoma remains the deadliest form of skin cancer because of its highly aggressive nature and the lack of effective treatments. Recent investigations into alternative treatment strategies have highlighted the exciting potential of nanoparticles to increase melanoma cell delivery and the efficacy of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pharmacological inhibitors. In this issue, Chen et al. report a new liposomal nanoparticle for c-Myc siRNA delivery, noting it to be highly effective in reducing c-Myc expression and inhibiting melanoma tumor growth in mouse models. This preclinical study underscores the importance of investigating nanoparticle treatment options for chemoresistant melanomas.",cancer
"Risk of colorectal cancer in men on long-term androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or orchiectomy is a common but controversial treatment for prostate cancer. Uncertainties remain about its use, particularly with increasing recognition of serious side effects. In animal studies, androgens protect against colonic carcinogenesis, suggesting that androgen deprivation may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: We identified 107 859 men in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1993 through 2002, with follow-up available through 2004. The primary outcome was development of colorectal cancer, determined from SEER files on second primary cancers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the influence of androgen deprivation on the outcome, adjusted for patient and prostate cancer characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Men who had orchiectomies had the highest unadjusted incidence rate of colorectal cancer (6.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3 to 7.5), followed by men who had GnRH agonist therapy (4.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 4.0 to 4.9), and men who had no androgen deprivation (3.7 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 3.5 to 3.9). After adjustment for patient and prostate cancer characteristics, there was a statistically significant dose-response effect (P(trend) = .010) with an increasing risk of colorectal cancer associated with increasing duration of androgen deprivation. Compared with the absence of these treatments, there was an increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with use of GnRH agonist therapy for 25 months or longer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.53) or with orchiectomy (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.66). CONCLUSION: Long-term androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.",cancer
"Targeted intervention strategies to increase and maintain mammography utilization among African American women. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of a theory-based, culturally relevant intervention designed to increase mammography screening among African American women in 8 underserved counties in Alabama. METHODS: Using principles derived from the Stages of Change, Community Health Advisor, and Community Empowerment models, we developed strategies to increase mammography screening. Trained volunteers (N = 143) provided tailored messages to encourage adoption and maintenance of mammography screening. We collected baseline and follow-up data on 1513 women in the communities targeted for the intervention. Our goal was to decrease the number of women in stage 1 (never screened) while increasing the number of women in stage 2 (infrequently screened) and stage 3 (regularly screened). RESULTS: At baseline, 14% (n = 211) of the women were in stage 1, 16% (n = 247) were in stage 2, and 70% (n = 1055) were in stage 3. After the 2-year intervention, 4% (n = 61) of the women remained in stage 1, 20% (n = 306) were in stage 2, and 76% (n = 1146) were in stage 3. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored motivational messages and peer support can increase mammography screening rates for African American women.",cancer
Sequencing of DC-SIGN promoter indicates an association between promoter variation and risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in cantonese. BACKGROUND: The dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an important pathogen recognition receptor of the innate immune system. DC-SIGN promoter variants play important role in the susceptibility to various infectious diseases. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy that is common in southern China and whether DC-SIGN promoter variants have effects on susceptibility to NPC is still unknown. The aim of this study is to ascertain the potential involvement of DC-SIGN promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NPC susceptibility. METHODS: We conducted a case control study based on Cantonese population including 444 NPC patients and 464 controls matched on age and sex. The 1041 bp of DC-SIGN promoter region was directly sequenced for all samples. Sequence alignment and SNP search were inspected using DNAStar analysis programs and haplotype frequencies were estimated in Haploview V 4.0. The associations between the SNPs and the risk of NPC were analyzed using chi-square test and non-conditional logistic regression analysis with SPSS 13.0 software. RESULTS: A total of six variants were observed in the DC-SIGN promoter region and DC-SIGN -139 GG and -939 AA were significantly associated with NPC risk with adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) of 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-3.59; P = 0.006) and 2.52 (1.29-4.93; P = 0.007) respectively and subjects carrying the risk allele DC-SIGN -871 G had 1.47-fold (95% CI = 1.14-1.90) increased risks of developing NPC (P = 0.003). Haplotype analysis revealed that h1 'AAAG' was significantly associated with protection against NPC (OR = 0.69; P = 0.0002) and the association was still significant when using 1000 permutation test runs (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that DC-SIGN promoter variants appear to be involved in the susceptibility to NPC and the detailed mechanism of this effect need further studies.,cancer

"DNMT3A mutations in acute myeloid leukemia. BACKGROUND: The genetic alterations responsible for an adverse outcome in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. METHODS: Using massively parallel DNA sequencing, we identified a somatic mutation in DNMT3A, encoding a DNA methyltransferase, in the genome of cells from a patient with AML with a normal karyotype. We sequenced the exons of DNMT3A in 280 additional patients with de novo AML to define recurring mutations. RESULTS: A total of 62 of 281 patients (22.1%) had mutations in DNMT3A that were predicted to affect translation. We identified 18 different missense mutations, the most common of which was predicted to affect amino acid R882 (in 37 patients). We also identified six frameshift, six nonsense, and three splice-site mutations and a 1.5-Mbp deletion encompassing DNMT3A. These mutations were highly enriched in the group of patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile (56 of 166 patients, or 33.7%) but were absent in all 79 patients with a favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The median overall survival among patients with DNMT3A mutations was significantly shorter than that among patients without such mutations (12.3 months vs. 41.1 months, P<0.001). DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse outcomes among patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile or FLT3 mutations, regardless of age, and were independently associated with a poor outcome in Cox proportional-hazards analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in patients with de novo AML with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and are independently associated with a poor outcome.

"Treatment of tracheal and bronchial tumors and tracheal and bronchial stent placement. Tumors of and trauma to the trachea and bronchi can result in loss of integrity of the airway and death. Once treated primarily with thoracic surgery, these conditions are increasingly being managed with interventional pulmonary procedures outside the operating room but requiring the assistance of anesthetists. These interventional procedures require airway instrumentation, necessitating anesthesia care for ventilation and obtundation of airway reflexes. A thorough preoperative assessment and consultation with the pulmonologist or surgeon performing the procedure are essential for successful completion of the tumor and scar reduction and subsequent stent placement. In addition, anesthetists may care for patients undergoing nonpulmonary surgery who have an existing bronchial or tracheal stent or patients requiring correction of displaced stents. A discussion on the preferred methods for caring for patients in these situations is included.",cancer
"Gastrosplenic fistula: etiologies, diagnostic studies, and surgical management. A gastrosplenic fistula is a rare event. Reported causes include a spontaneous malignant fistula, chemotherapy for gastric or splenic malignancies, peptic ulcer disease, Crohn disease, and trauma. We report a case of a gastrosplenic fistula discovered on abdominal computed tomography with contrast, performed in a patient with a history suspicious for malignancy. In this case, no etiology was identified prior to the surgical repair of the lesion despite extensive workup. Due to continued gastrointestinal blood loss requiring multiple transfusions, the patient was taken to surgery for splenectomy and partial gastrectomy. It was at that time that the diagnosis of a large B-cell lymphoma was made. Postoperative chemotherapy was initiated and led to remission of the malignancy. Though most cases require definitive surgical repair, the treatment plans for gastrosplenic fistulas depend largely on the etiology of the lesion.",cancer
"Fat replacement of the distal pancreas in a case of advanced gastric cancer. Preoperative computed tomography in a 67-year-old man admitted with type 2 advanced gastric cancer involving the upper body of the stomach revealed marked atrophy of the left lobe of the liver and atrophy of the distal pancreas. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was planned; however, additional distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was also performed during the operation because of direct invasion of the pancreas by the gastric cancer. Histopathologic examination of the resected pancreas revealed the absence of lobules, acini, conduits, and pancreatic ducts, with only islets of Langerhans found scattered in the adipose tissue. The findings revealed that the gastric cancer had directly invaded the fat, replacing the distal pancreas. In patients with fat-replaced pancreas, preoperative evaluation of direct invasion of adjacent organs/tissues by gastric cancer is difficult.",cancer
"Preoperative imaging diagnosis of carotid body tumors. Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are relatively frequent lesions encountered at high altitudes, such in as the Andean Mountains. A correct preoperative diagnosis is essential for surgical planning and performance. For this reason, we have reviewed the evolution of our experience in the imaging diagnosis of these tumors. Between 1980 and June 2008, 160 CBTs were diagnosed. A total of 138 tumors were operated on, 4 are waiting for surgery, and 18 were not operated on because of age, medical conditions, or patient refusal. We have reviewed retrospectively the modalities of imaging diagnosis in our patients who underwent operation. Among the 138 tumors operated on, a correct preoperative diagnosis was done in 127 cases (92%). The preoperative diagnosis of the remaining 11 patients was unspecified benign tumor for 6 patients and neck lymph node for 5 patients. The imaging methods performed by different radiologists were conventional ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound, carotid conventional angiography (CA), axial tomography, magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance angiography, and computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Most patients had more than one image study. Review of radiologist reports revealed a correct diagnosis in all carotid CA, magnetic resonance studies, and CTA. Additionally, CTA appeared to be a valuable method to predict the Shamblin group. Clinical suspicion and current image techniques permit a correct diagnosis in practically all cases of CBT.",cancer
"Clinical and dermoscopic progression of subungual hematomas. Subungual pigmentation is a very common problem and can result from pigments derived from melanin, blood, or fungi. Subungual hematoma usually appears as a reddish to reddish-black pigment depending on the age of the bleed, and it can easily be misdiagnosed as melanoma. In this study, we tried to show the clinical and dermoscopic progression of subungual hematomas. Thirty-six patients with the history of first nail trauma within the last 7 days were included in the study. All the patients were evaluated three times with 3-week intervals. The distance from proximal nail fold to the hematoma was measured by a paper ruler. The area and the largest diameter of the hematoma were calculated by using the Molescore software. At the beginning, the most common dermoscopic finding was the homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by small globules (n = 32, 88.9%), large globules (n = 29, 80.6%), and streaks (n = 19, 52.8%). At week 3, the most common dermoscopic finding was the homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by large globules (n = 27, 75%), small globules (n = 19, 52.8%), and streaks (n = 11, 30.6%). At the sixth week, the most common dermoscopic finding was homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by large globules (n = 16, 44.4%), small globules (n = 7, 19.4%), and streaks (n = 2, 5.6%). The diameter and the area of the hematoma shrunk gradually between weeks 0, 3, and 6 (P < 0.001). Dermoscopy is a very useful tool in the evaluation and differential diagnosis of subungual hematomas. Determination that the pigmented plague grows out distally and shrinks gradually will support the diagnosis of subungual hematoma.",cancer
"The effectiveness of transverse coloplasty in patients with ultra-lower rectal cancer. Rectal cancer accounts for 40% of colon cancer, and postoperative defecatory function is considered to markedly affect the patients' quality of life. We performed transverse coloplasty in 33 patients with rectal cancer who had undergone an anal function preservation operation in which the anastomotic site was within 1 cm of the dentate line (ultra-low anterior resection) and evaluated its effectiveness in controlling the patients' defecatory function. The average daily defecation frequency 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively was 7.8, 5, and 3.6 times daily following straight colorectal reconstruction (the anastomotic site was more than 5 cm from the dentate line) and 7.5, 3.5, and 2.4 times daily following transverse coloplasty, respectively. Concerning postoperative complications, anastomotic leakage, soiling, and constipation were observed in 1, 1, and 1 cases, respectively. Transverse coloplasty can be performed in a short time, and it is considered a safe and useful method to manage defecatory",cancer
"Significance of PET/CT in determining actual TNM staging for patients with various lung cancers. We investigated the difference in TNM stage of lung cancer provided by PET/CT (combining positron emission tomography and computed tomography) as compared with TNM stage obtained with conventional imaging studies (CI) with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with iron contrast media. Sixty-seven cases of lung cancer were included in this study. Overall, the rate of correction of TNM staging was 70.1% after PET/CT. The correction rate for each factor was 32.8% in T, 37.3% in N, and 37.3% in M. High rates of correction were observed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with 75% (6/8 cases) obtained by PET/CT. When SCLCs were divided into limited disease (n = 6) involving 1 hemithorax, including mediastinal and contralateral hilar lymph nodes, and others (extensive disease, n = 2), the correction rate was as high as 80% for limited disease. In conclusion, PET/CT can provide actual TNM staging and recognition for oncologists in staging, which would not mislead to selection of inadequate subsequent treatment.",cancer
"Radical perineal prostatectomy: the first experience. OBJECTIVE: to present relatively uncommon surgical procedure for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) underwent perineal radical prostatectomy (PRP) from 2006 to 2010. The average age was 65 +/- 5.2 years. The average preoperative PSA was 7.8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml. Two patients had pT2b stage, while four had pT2c stage. Gleason score ranged from 4-7. RESULTS: All patients had negative surgical margins. Average operative time was 109 +/- 20 minutes and average blood loss was 525 +/- 180 ml. The urethral catheter was removed after 12 days in all patients except one, who required prolonged catheterization due to urinary fistula. All patients were continent after three months. Average postoperative PSA was 0.07 +/- 0.03 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: Perineal radical prostatectomy is valuable surgical procedure that provides good oncological results as well as urinary and sexual function.",cancer
"Single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for cancer using a ""QuadiPort access system"". BACKGROUND: Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is developing rapidly and different devices are already available. However there is limited data in the literature about single port laparoscopic colorectal surgery. AIMS: We report the first case of a single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for cancer using the device ""QuadiPort Access System. METHODS: A 66 year old female affected by adenocarcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction underwent a radical single incision laparoscopic anterior resection performed by an experienced laparoscopic team. RESULTS: The preoperative staging was T2NOM0. The total operative time was 135 min. Length of hospital stay was 6 days. The length of the specimen was 27 cm and 21 nodes were isolated. The pathological examination showed adenocarcinoma staged T3N2MX; G2. There was no postoperative morbidity and at the 6 month follow-up, the patient presented in well condition with no complications and free from cancer. CONCLUSION: Single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for locally advanced high rectal cancer seems to be feasible and the ""QuadiPort Access System seems to be a valid device. To evaluate outcomes and costeffectiveness of SILS versus the standard laparoscopic colorectal surgery multicenter prospective randomised trials are necessary and the ""QuadiPort Access System"" could prove to be the device of choice.",cancer
"From mininvasive to maxinvasive surgery in colorectal cancer: modem evolution of oncologic specialized units. In the last years a wide range of new technique offers the possibility to have R0 resection in colorectal cancer. We report our experience about Single Port Laparoscopic Surgery (SPL) for not advanced right colon cancer and about pelvectomy with cilindric Abdominal Perineal Resection (APR) for advanced rectal cancer. SPL offer mainly cosmetic advantages but also quicker recovery. No touch technique with adequate surgical margin and lymphectomy were respected. Operative time of SPL was 85-115 minutes, the incision was 5 cm long. There were no complications. Length of hospital stay was 4-6 days. With advanced pelvic cancer, pelvic exenteration with en-bloc resection is indicated. Then we propose a case of a 55 years old woman with a pelvic recurrence from a metastatic rectal cancer involving the right obturator fossa, the vaginal stump, the right ureter. Modern surgical technique give us the chance to offer the most appropriate oncologic surgical treatment.",cancer
"This review highlights the clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 in children and neonates and contrasts these features with other common respiratory viruses. Although the majority of infections in children are mild, there are many important, as yet, unanswered questions (specifically, the attack rate in children and the role of children as vectors of infection), that will have a major impact on disease in adults. There are no distinctive clinical characteristics that will allow the infectious disease consultant to make the diagnosis without laboratory testing. SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less common with lower morbidity and mortality than RSV or influenza and causes less severe disease in children with cancer than these more common viruses. The range of severity of infection during pregnancy is comparable to infection in non-pregnant cohorts. Intrauterine infection has been documented but is uncommon. A theme of less severe disease in individuals with modulated immune systems is emerging.",nocancer
"Snails can provide a considerable variety of bioactive compounds for cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries, useful for the development of new formulations with less toxicity and post effects compared to regular compounds used for the purpose. Compounds from crude extract, mucus, slime consist of glycans, polypeptides, proteins, etc., and can be used for curing diseases like viral lesions, warts, and different dermal problems. Some particular uses of snails involve treating post-traumatic stress. Micro RNA of Lymnaea stagnalis, was known to be responsible for the development of long-term memory and treatment of Alzheimer's and Dementia like diseases. This review explores the application of various bioactive compounds from snails with its potential as new translational medicinal and cosmetic applications. Snail bioactive compounds like omega-MVIIA, mu-SIIIA, muO-MrVIB, Xen2174, delta-EVIA, alpha-Vc1.1, sigma-GVIIA, Conantokin-G, and Contulakin-G, conopeptides can be used for the development of anti-cancer drugs.

"In developed countries, contact with plastics is constant. Plastics contain a vast number of additives such as plasticisers, stabilisers, antioxidants, flame retardants, etc., that can impact human health. Most of them have been studied separately; however, an integrative approach to identify genes, biological processes, molecular functions, and diseases linked to exposure to these compounds has not been addressed until now. The genes most commonly affected by plastic additives are related to apoptosis, cell death, proliferation and differentiation, immunity and insulin-related processes, and are mainly associated with cancer, mental disorders, diabetes mellitus type II and obesity. The most commonly affected molecular functions included steroid hormone receptor activity implicated in cancer, mental disorders, immune signalling and gonadotropin-releasing hormones. These processes and functions affected by plastic additives are related to the diseases of the developed world, most of which are linked to the endocrine system, such as cancer, diabetes, infertility and obesity. The strong interconnection among the top 50 genes modulated by plastic additives shows that the pathways affected are strongly interrelated. Therefore, studying the effects of plastic additives through a single-compound approach cannot be sufficient and a holistic approach is more appropriate for evaluating the potential effects of plastics in human health.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To test the hypothesis that an accelerated, T1-weighted 3D CAIPIRINHA SPACE sequence with isotropic voxel size offers a similar performance to conventional T1-weighted 2D TSE (turbo spin echo) for the evaluation of bone tumor extent and characteristics. METHODS: Thirty-four patients who underwent 3-T MRI with 3DT1 (CAIPIRINHA SPACE TSE) and 2DT1 (TSE) were included. Sequence acquisition time was reported. Two radiologists independently evaluated each technique for tumor location, size/length, tumor-to-joint distance, signal intensity, margin/extraosseous extension, and signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise (CNR) ratios. RESULTS: Tumors were located in long (20/36, 55.5%) and pelvic (16/36, 44.4%) bones. 3DT1 sequence required an average acquisition time of 235 s (+- 42 s, range 156-372), while two plane 2DT1 sequences combined (coronal and axial) had an average acquisition time of 381 s (+- 73 s, range 312-523). There was no difference in the measurements of tumor length and tumor-to-joint distance (p = 0.95) between 3DT1 and 2DT1 images. Tumors were hypointense (17/36, 47.2% vs 17/36, 47.2%), isointense (12/36, 33.3% vs 12/36, 33.3%), or hyperintense (7/36, 19.4% vs 7/36, 19.4%) on 3DT1 vs 2DT1, respectively. Assessment of tumor margins and extraosseous extension was similar, and there was no difference in tumor SNR or CNR (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: An accelerated 3D CAIPIRINHA SPACE T1 sequence provides comparable assessments of intramedullary bone tumor extent and similar tumor characteristics to conventional 2DT1 MRI. For the assessment of bone tumors, the isotropic volume acquisition and multiplanar reformation capability of the 3DT1 datasets can obviate the need for 2DT1 acquisitions in multiple planes. KEY POINTS:   3DT1 offers an equivalent performance to 2DT1 for the assessment of bone tumor characteristics, with faster and higher resolution capability, obviating the need for acquiring 2DT1 in multiple planes.   There was no difference in the measurements of tumor length and tumor-to-joint distance obtained on 3DT1 and 2DT1 images.   There was no difference in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) or contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) measures between 3DT1 and 2DT1.",nocancer

"Low dimensional nanomaterials (LDNMs) have earned attention among researchers as they exhibit a larger surface area to volume and quantum confinement effect compared to high dimensional nanomaterials. LDNMs, including 0-D and 1-D, possess several beneficial biomedical properties such as bioimaging, sensor, cosmetic, drug delivery, and cancer tumors ablation. However, they threaten human beings with the adverse effects of cytotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and genotoxicity when exposed for a prolonged time in industry or laboratory. Among different toxicities, genotoxicity must be taken into consideration with utmost importance as they inherit DNA related disorders causing congenital disabilities and malignancy to human beings. Many researchers have performed NMs' genotoxicity using various cell lines and animal models and reported the effect on various physicochemical and biological factors. In the present work, we have compiled a comparative study on the genotoxicity of the same or different kinds of NMs. Notwithstanding, we have included the classification of genotoxicity, mechanism, assessment, and affecting factors. Further, we have highlighted the importance of studying the genotoxicity of LDNMs and signified the perceptions, future challenges, and possible directives in the field.",nocancer
"Venous thromboembolism, comprising both deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a chronic illness that affects nearly 10 million people every year worldwide. Strong provoking risk factors for venous thromboembolism include major surgery and active cancer, but most events are unprovoked. Diagnosis requires a sequential work-up that combines assessment of clinical pretest probability for venous thromboembolism using a clinical score (eg, Wells score), D-dimer testing, and imaging. Venous thromboembolism can be considered excluded in patients with both a non-high clinical pretest probability and normal D-dimer concentrations. When required, ultrasonography should be done for a suspected deep vein thrombosis and CT or ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy for a suspected pulmonary embolism. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are the first-line treatment for almost all patients with venous thromboembolism (including those with cancer). After completing 3-6 months of initial treatment, anticoagulation can be discontinued in patients with venous thromboembolism provoked by a major transient risk factor. Patients whose long-term risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism outweighs the long-term risk of major bleeding, such as those with active cancer or men with unprovoked venous thromboembolism, should receive indefinite anticoagulant treatment. Pharmacological venous thromboembolism prophylaxis is generally warranted in patients undergoing major orthopaedic or cancer surgery. Ongoing research is focused on improving diagnostic strategies for suspected deep vein thrombosis, comparing different DOACs, developing safer anticoagulants, and further individualising approaches for the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism.",nocancer

"CONTEXT: Hospice deaths in the U.S. are increasing. Dying hospice patients may have rapidly emerging needs the hospice team cannot immediately meet, exposing family caregivers to fright-inducing (i.e., scary) situations. OBJECTIVE: Examine relationships between hospice care and family caregiver exposures and psychological responses to witnessing common, distressing patient symptoms near the end of life. METHODS: Secondary analysis of prospective, cohort study of 169 patients with advanced cancer and their family caregivers were analyzed. Multivariable regression analyses modeled associations between hospice use and caregiver exposures and psychological responses (fear and helplessness) to witnessing distressing symptoms common near death, adjusting for potential confounding influences (e.g. home death, patient characteristics, and suffering). Caregiver self-reported exposures and responses to observing patient symptoms during the last month of life were assessed using the validated Stressful Caregiving Response to Experiences of Dying (SCARED) scale. RESULTS: Hospice care was significantly, positively associated with more exposures and negative psychological responses to distressing patient symptoms, adjusting for home death, patient characteristics and physical and mental suffering. On average, hospice patients' caregivers scored 1.6 points higher on the SCARED exposure scale and 6.2 points higher on the SCARED psychological response scale than caregivers of patients without hospice (exposure: 10.53 versus 8.96; psychological responses: 29.85 versus 23.67). Patient pain/discomfort, delirium, and difficulty swallowing/choking were reported by three-fourths of caregivers and were associated with the most fear and helplessness among caregivers. CONCLUSION: Hospice care is associated with more exposures to and caregiver fear and helplessness in response to ""scary"" patient experiences. Research is needed to understand how better to support family caregivers of hospice patients to enable them to cope with common, distressing symptoms of dying cancer patients. Hospice clinicians providing additional education and training about these symptoms might enable caregivers to better care for dying loved ones and reduce the stresses of end-of-life caregiving.",nocancer
"The nuclear receptor superfamily is a family of ligand-activated transcription factors that play a key role in cell metabolism and human diseases. They can be modified after translation, such as acetylation, ubiquitination, phosphorylation and SUMOylation. Crosstalk between SUMO and ubiquitin, phosphorylation and acetylation regulates a variety of metabolic and physiological activities. Nuclear receptors play an important role in lipid metabolism, inflammation, bile acid homeostasis and autophagy. SUMOylation nuclear receptors can regulate their function and affect cell metabolism. It also provides a potential therapeutic target for atherosclerosis, tumor and other metabolic and inflammation-related diseases. This review focuses on the function of SUMOylation nuclear receptors.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: We aimed to investigate associations of self-rated health with fruit and vegetable consumption (FVC) and physical activity (PA) among older cancer survivors. METHODS: We used the 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to identify cancer survivors >= 65 years (N = 2663). Self-reported FVC and PA were categorized as ordinal variables to approximate quartiles. Low general health (LGH) was defined as fair or poor self-rated health. A multivariable logistic regression treating LGH as the outcome was used to calculate adjusted odd ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for FVC and PA. Restricted cubic spline depicted non-linear dose-response curves for FVC and PA. In comparative analysis, we used the same logistic regression and dose-response model to calculate ORs of FVC and PA in 73,134 people >= 65 years without cancer history. RESULTS: Overall, 470 (17.7%) survivors had LGH. Survivors' mean age was 73.3 years (SD = 5.2), 55.1% of them were female, and 95.4% self-reported as white. In cancer survivors, FVC was not associated with LGH (>= 28 vs. < 14 times/week: aOR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.75-1.39, p-trend = 0.50), whereas PA was inversely associated with LGH (>= 30 vs. < 7 MET-hours/week: aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.41-0.75, p-trend < 0.01). Dose-response curves demonstrated consistent association patterns. In comparative analysis, ORs of PA did not change substantially but we observed inverse association for FVC. CONCLUSIONS: An inverse association between PA and LGH was observed among older cancer survivors, but no significant association was obtained for FVC among them. Regular PA may maintain or indicate a favorable health in older cancer survivors, whereas impacts of FVC deserve further investigations.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Acquired ungual fibrokeratomas (AUFKs) are benign recurrent fibrokeratotic tumors of the nail unit of uncertain etiology. Little is known about the optimal modality to successfully treat these lesions. No systematic review addressing ungual fibrokeratomas has been published to date. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to summarize all the published data regarding diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of AUFKs. METHODS: On August 9, 2019, a systematic search of Medline and Cochrane databases was conducted. All the studies describing the treatment of ungual fibrokeratomas, procedure description, pathological findings, outcome, and follow-up period were included in this review. RESULTS: After full-text article review, 103 articles were included, representing a total of 78 lesions. The commonly used treatments for fibrokeratomas were complete tumor resection (90.5%), shave excision (8.3%), and cryotherapy (1.2%). Complete surgical excision yielded the highest cure rate among all treatment modalities (90.8%) compared to partial surgical excision (28.6%) and cryotherapy (0%). The mean follow-up period was 12.1 months (1-144). CONCLUSION: Complete surgical removal preserving the matrix showed the highest cure rates and should be considered as first-line treatment for AUFKs.

"In obesity, adipocytes are dysfunctional with excessive production and secretion of pro-inflammatory hormones and cytokines, ie, adipokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and leptin. Accumulating evidence has shown that leptin possesses pleiotropic functions including stimulation of angiogenesis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, various leptin associated activities involve a wide distribution of leptin receptors. For example, increased serum leptin was associated with tissue receptor resistance in metabolic syndrome. Although increased serum leptin, receptor and signaling impairment are involved in wound healing, hair cycle and the pathogenesis of many skin diseases such as psoriasis and lupus erythematosus as well as skin cancer, its exact role remains unclear. In the present article, we discuss the biochemistry of leptin action and its potential role in the pathophysiology of diverse skin diseases.",nocancer
"Objective: Speech impairment is common in patients affected by head and neck cancer and impact on quality of life. Therefore, specific instruments are required for its evaluation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the Italian Speech Handicap Index. Methods: Data were obtained from 50 patients and 75 asymptomatic subjects. The study consisted of five phases: (1) item generation, (2) internal consistency and reliability analysis, (3) normative data generation, (4) validity analysis, performed by comparing the Italian Speech Handicap Index scores obtained in patients and asymptomatic subjects, and by correlating its scores with the results of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Head and Neck Module, and (5) cut-off value. Results: Internal consistency was good (Cronbach alpha = 0.9) and the test-retest reliability was strong. A significant difference in Italian Speech Handicap Index total score between patients and asymptomatic subjects was found. Moderate correlations between the two questionnaires were observed. A cut-off value of 14.5 demonstrated a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 100%. Conclusion: The Italian Speech Handicap Index is a reliable and valid clinical tool.

"The poor water solubility and bioactivity of drugs can be potentially improved by using suitable nanocarriers. Herein, an economically viable methodology is developed for encapsulation of hydrophobic anticancer agent, curcumin in casein nanoparticles (CasNPs). The successful encapsulation of curcumin was evident from the structural, thermal and spectroscopic analysis of curcumin encapsulated CasNPs (Cur-CasNPs). The CasNPs and Cur-CasNPs samples were lyophilized for their long-term stability and lyophilized powders are found to be stable more than 6 months at 4-8 oC. From DLS studies, it has been observed that the variation in average size of drug formulations before and after reconstitution were less than 5%. Further, it shows good water-dispersibility, enhanced bioavailability and pH dependent charge conversal feature. Cur-CasNPs showed pH dependent release characteristics with higher at mild acidic environment and enhanced toxicity towards cancer cells (MCF-7) as compared to normal cells (CHO). Moreover, the CasNPs are non-toxic in nature and the developed nanoformulation of drug exhibits substantial cellular internalization and enhanced toxicity towards MCF-7 cells over pure drug, indicating their potential applications.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Recent genetic studies identified common mutations between diverticular disease and connective tissue disorders, some of which are associated with abdominal wall hernias. Scarce data exists, however, shedding light on the potential clinical implications of this shared etiology, particularly in the era of laparoscopic surgery. METHODS: The New York Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database was used to identify adult patients undergoing elective sigmoid and left hemicolectomy (open or laparoscopic) from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2016, for diverticulitis or descending/sigmoid colon cancer. The incidences of incisional hernia diagnosis and repair were compared using competing risks regression models, clustered by surgeon and adjusted for a host of demographic/clinical variables. Subsequent abdominal surgery and death were considered competing risks. RESULTS: Among 8279 patients included in the study cohort, 6811 (82.2%) underwent colectomy for diverticulitis and 1468 (17.8%) for colon cancer. The overall 5-year risk of incisional hernia was 3.5% among patients with colon cancer, regardless of colectomy route, which was significantly lower than that among diverticulitis patients after both open (10.7%; p < 0.001) and laparoscopic (7.2%; p = 0.007) colectomies. Multivariable analyses demonstrated that patients with diverticulitis experienced a two-fold increase in the risk for hernia diagnosis (aHR 1.8; p < 0.001) and repair (aHR 2.1; p < 0.001), and these findings persisted after stratification by colectomy route. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing elective colectomy for diverticulitis, including via laparoscopic approach, experience higher rates of incisional hernia compared with patients undergoing similar resections for colon cancer. When performing resections for diverticulitis, surgeons should strongly consider adherence to evidence-based guidelines for fascial closure to prevent this important complication.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Total elbow arthroplasty (TEA) is associated with a relatively high complication rate, and exceptionally catastrophic complications might lead to amputation. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and aetiology of amputation performed at our institution in upper extremity limbs with a prior TEA. METHODS: Between 1973 and 2018, 1906 consecutive TEAs were performed at our institution. Upper extremity amputation was performed in seven (0.36%) elbows with five transhumeral amputations and two shoulder disarticulations. The group consisted of five females and two males with a mean age of 64 years (range, 37-80). The index TEA had been performed for rheumatoid arthritis (n = 2), rheumatoid arthritis with acute fracture (n = 2), radiation associated nonunion (n = 2), and metastatic cancer (n = 1). Mean follow-up after amputation was three years (range, 3 months-5 years). RESULTS: Mean time between amputation and TEA was 5 years (range, 2 months-13 years). The indications for amputation included uncontrolled deep infection in six (86%) elbows and tumor recurrence in one (14%) elbow. Only one elbow (14%) was fitted with a prosthesis. Six (86%) patients died at a mean of three years (range, 3 months-5 years) after amputation. CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlight a low incidence of amputation after TEA. Most amputations were the direct result of TEA complications, with infection being the most common cause of amputation. Outcomes after amputation are concerning, with poor overall survival and few patients being fit for a prosthesis.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is a master regulator of oxygen homeostasis. The increased expression of genes targeted by HIF is associated with many human diseases, including ischemic cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic lung disease, and cancer. AREAS COVERED: This patent survey summarizes the information about patented HIF inhibitors over the last 5 years. EXPERT OPINION: HIF inhibitors have been studied for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer, and have shown promise for the treatment of hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, a circadian rhythm disorder, calcific aortic valve disease, cerebrovascular accident, and heterotopic ossification. In addition, HIF-2alpha inhibitors can be used for the treatment or prevention of iron overload disorders, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and thyroid eye disease, or to improve muscle generation and repair. PT2385 completed phase I clinical trials for the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. It exerted a higher synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor growth in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, in comparison with each treatment alone, indicating that effective immunotherapy for solid tumors counteracts of the immunosuppression induced by hypoxia. Therefore, considering the effects of hypoxia on cancer cells, stromal cells, and effector immune cells, it is important to develop inhibitors of molecular pathways activated by hypoxia for successful treatments.",nocancer

"Three-dimensional (3D) culturing mimics the heterogeneous cellular conditions of the in vivo tumor microenvironment compared to 2D monolayer-cultured cells and 3D cultures of established cancer cell lines (sphere culture) or patient-derived cancer cells (organoid culture) are frequently used for cancer research or drug screening and evaluation. To establish more cost and time-efficient 3D culture methods for cancer cell lines, we supplemented sphere culture medium with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and found that 3D sphere cultures of breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were significantly increased. Mechanistically, we found that PVA prevented cell death and promoted cellular proliferation while maintaining levels of stemness-related gene expression. Furthermore, we showed that polyvinyl formal resin (PVF) 3D scaffolds made by crosslinked PVA can function in serum-free, long-term 3D cultures to support maintenance of sphere- or tumor-like cell masses for diverse cancer cell types. Taken together, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PVA and PVF in human cancer cell line culture protocols.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Treatment of older patients (more than 60 years) with ulcerative colitis (UC) can be a challenge, because they might be more vulnerable to adverse events (AEs). We determined the effects of age on the safety and efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy in a pooled analysis of data from randomized trials. METHODS: We obtained individual patient-level data from 4 trials of anti-TNF therapy for patients with UC from the Yale Open Data Access Project. Participants were assigned to groups of older age (60 years or older) and younger age (younger than 60 years). The primary outcome was difference in serious AEs (SAEs), defined as death, life-threatening event, hospitalization, and/or significant disability. Secondary outcomes were severe infections, non-severe infections, neoplasms, and achievement of clinical remission, defined by trial investigators as Mayo score <= 2 with no sub-score >1 at the end of induction or maintenance therapy. A random effects logistic regression model was fitted to estimate the effect of anti-TNF therapy on safety and efficacy by age, adjusting for confounders and trial-level effects. RESULTS: The study cohort included 2257 patients (231 60 years or older). Higher proportions of older patients receiving anti-TNF therapy had SAEs (20%) and hospitalizations (14.4%), compared with younger patients (10.2% had SAEs and 5.2% were hospitalized); there were no significant differences between groups in proportions with severe or non-severe infections. Compared with placebo, there was no significant difference in safety risks associated with anti-TNF therapy (SAEs reduced by 5.4% in older patients vs reduction of 2.4% in younger patients; hospitalizations reduced by 6.7% in older patients vs reduction of 2.5% in younger patients; severe infections reduced by 3.1% vs increase of 0.7% in younger patients). There was no significant difference in between older vs younger patients in efficacy of anti-TNF therapy in inducing remission (odds risk ratio, 1.05, 95% CI, 0.33-3.39) or in maintaining remission (odds risk ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.18-1.33). CONCLUSIONS: In a pooled analysis of data from randomized trials, we found that older patients with UC have an increased baseline increased risk of SAEs, but no increase in risk can be attributed to anti-TNF therapy in older vs younger patients.",nocancer
"Different species of the genus Pouteria have been used in folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, fever, ulcers, diabetes, and diarrhea. We analyzed the phytochemical profile of the hydroethanolic extract from Pouteria ramiflora leaves by electrospray ionization ion trap tandem mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection, and examined whether it alone and in combination with cisplatin interfered with cell proliferation and death processes in HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma) and FGH (human gingival fibroblasts) cells. Five compounds were identified in the extract: gallic acid, myricetin-3-O-alpha-l-arabinopyranoside, quercetin-3-O-beta-d-galactopyranoside, myricetin-3-O-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and myricetin-3-O-beta-d-galactopyranoside. The extract was cytotoxic to both cell lines by inducing apoptotic cell death and acted in synergy with cisplatin; such effect was stronger in HepG2 cells than in FGH cells, demonstrating some selectivity to tumor cells. In HepG2 cells, the extract exerted antiproliferative effect mediated by induction of cell cycle arrest at the S and G2/M phases. Association of the extract with cisplatin enhanced the latter's antiproliferative effect, arrested the cell cycle at the S phase by CDK2 modulation, and reduced the number of anti-cyclin D1-stained HepG2 cells. Simultaneous treatment with the extract and cisplatin increased the latter's cytotoxicity, apoptotic cell death, and BAX expression in HepG2 cells. Altogether, the results reported herein indicate that P. ramiflora extract is a possible adjuvant to cancer therapy, which can circumvent the cisplatin-mediated resistance mechanisms in cancer cells.",nocancer
"Phytochemicals refer to active substances in plant-based diets. Phytochemicals found in for example fruits, vegetables, grains and seed oils are considered relatively safe for consumption due to mammal-plant co-evolution and adaptation. A number of human diseases are related to oxidative stress caused by for example chemical environmental contaminants in air, water and food; while also lifestyle including smoking and lack of exercise and dietary preferences are important factors for disease development in humans. Here we explore the dietary sources of antioxidant phytochemicals that have beneficial effects on oxidative stress, cardiovascular and neurological diseases as well as cancer. Plant-based diets usually contain phenolic acids, flavonoids and carotenoids, which have strong antioxidant properties, and therefore remove the excess of active oxygen in the body, and protect cells from damage, reducing the risk of cardiovascular and Alzheimer's disease. In most cases, obesity is related to diet and inactivity and plant-based diets change lipid composition and metabolism, which reduce obesity related hazards. Cruciferous and Allium vegetables are rich in organic sulphides that can act on the metabolism of carcinogens and therefore used as anti-cancer and suppressing agents while dietary fibres and plant sterols may improve intestinal health and prevent intestinal diseases. Thus, we recommend a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and grains as its content of phytochemicals may have the potential to prevent or improve a broad sweep of various diseases.",nocancer
"Primary central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis is an uncommon disorder of unknown etiology that is restricted to the brain and spinal cord. Patients do not present with specific clinical features or a classical clinical course, and no blood or imaging investigations are available for diagnostic confirmation. Cerebral biopsy and angiography are the gold standards for diagnosis. No randomized clinical trials have described a therapeutic regimen effective for primary CNS vasculitis; therefore, treatment of primary CNS vasculitis is based on therapeutic strategies used for other types of vasculitis. Early diagnosis is important because corticosteroid-based treatment with or without concomitant cyclophosphamide administration can often prevent serious outcomes and may be followed by a favorable response. Several immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil, tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers, and rituximab may be useful options for patients refractory to the aforementioned regimen. We describe some diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for the management of this condition, with a focus on the importance of obtaining tissue and angiographic evaluation (formal contrast-enhanced or magnetic resonance/computed tomography angiography).",nocancer
"Central venous access devices have revolutioned the care of children affected by malignancies, facilitating management of complex and prolonged infusive therapies, reducing pain and discomfort related to repeated blood samples and indiscriminate venipunctures, thus reducing also psychological stress of both patients and families. In this respect, peripherally inserted central catheters have been disseminated for use, even in pediatric oncology patients, for their many advantages: easy and non-invasive placement with no risk of insertion-related complications, as well as easy removal; reduced need for general anesthesia both for insertion and removal; adequate prolonged performance also for challenging therapies (e.g. stem cell transplantation); and low rate of late complications. Nonetheless, concerns have been recently raised about use of such devices in children with cancer, especially regarding a presumed (but not demonstrated) high risk of catheter-related venous thrombosis. Are we facing a new witch (or peripherally inserted central catheter) hunt? The choice of the central venous access device-particularly in oncologic children-should be based on an evaluation of clinical advantages and risks, as provided by appropriate and scientifically accurate clinical studies.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To explore (1) perceptions of tobacco cessation for patients, (2) perceived role in addressing patients' tobacco use, (3) facilitators and barriers to providing cessation services, and (4) perceptions and use of tobacco cessation resources among oncology providers. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 24 oncology providers at a National Cancer Institute-Designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Qualitative themes were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: Participants (1) perceived smoking cessation's priority as low and/or dependent upon clinical factors, (2) described a passive role in addressing tobacco cessation, (3) described loss-framed versus gain-framed messaging when delivering cessation advice, (4) reported moderate self-efficacy in discussing and low self-efficacy in implementing cessation strategies, (5) described multi-level facilitators and barriers to patients' tobacco cessation, and (6) expressed high value for the cancer center's tobacco cessation service. CONCLUSION: Oncology providers in this study perceived patients' tobacco cessation as a low priority relative to providing direct cancer treatment and addressing acute complications. These findings indicate opportunities for training to increase delivery of evidence-based cessation advice and facilitate patients' engagement in cessation services. Provider trainings on embracing an active role in tobacco cessation, addressing multi-level barriers to patients' tobacco cessation, and using gain-framed messaging should be implemented. This has the potential to improve cancer patients' treatment outcomes.",nocancer
"Eczematous drug eruptions are a heterogenous group of skin reactions that resemble eczema both clinically and histologically. We reviewed the literature and cataloged the systemically administered medications that cause these eruptions, along with their characteristic clinical presentations. We identified three primary pathophysiologic etiologies: (1) cutaneous immunomodulation, (2) skin dehydration, and (3) delayed hypersensitivity. Notably, eczematous eruptions caused by altered immunity in the skin may be increasing in incidence as some responsible drugs, in particular biologic therapies (such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-17 inhibitors) and targeted cancer treatments (including immune checkpoint inhibitors and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors), become more commonly employed in clinical practice. Other notable causes of eczematous eruptions include antiviral agents for hepatitis C virus and cardiovascular medications in elderly individuals, and notable subtypes of eczematous reactions include systemic contact dermatitis and photoallergic reactions, which are also discussed. The diagnostic gold standard is drug rechallenge and most reactions may be treated effectively with emollients, topical corticosteroids, and oral antihistamines.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is a severe adverse reaction experienced by some patients exposed to certain drugs (antiresorptives such as bisphosphonates or denosumab, and antiangiogenic drugs). From a review of the literature it appears that there is no uniform criterion when selecting preventive measures; these vary according to author. Likewise, the measures recommended are usually general, so that in few cases they result in specific actions to be applied depending on the different variables involved such as the type of drug used, the duration of its application, the underlying pathology, the presence or absence of risk factors, etc. The aim of this study has been to design a preventive protocol which can be easily applied in any clinic or by any dental care service. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We undertook an exhaustive literature review to find any articles related to the topic of study, namely, preventive measures for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw, on the one hand generically and on the other focusing on dental implant treatment. The most part the criteria of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. From 3946 items, we selected a total of 21 items. RESULTS: From the analysis of the selected articles, several protocols have been developed that are easy to apply in a dental clinic.: Protocol 1. Before starting treatment with antiresorptives (Patients who are going to be treated for osteoporosis / Patients who are going to be treated for cancer). Protocol 2. Once treatment is initiated with antiresorptives (Patients being treated for osteoporosis / Patients being treated for cancer). CONCLUSIONS: The application of these protocols requires an interdisciplinary team which can handle the various treatments and apply the measures contained in them. Along with a team of well-educated and trained dentists, it is equally important to maintain contact with the medical team involved in the treatment of the underlying pathology, especially rheumatologists, oncologists, internists and gynaecologists. All the above requires a great staff learning and organization effort, continuous training and coordination of the whole team involved in the preventive management of these patients.",nocancer
"ConspectusFlow cytometry is a powerful tool with applications in diverse fields such as microbiology, immunology, virology, cancer biology, stem cell biology, and metabolic engineering. It rapidly counts and characterizes large heterogeneous populations of cells in suspension (e.g., blood cells, stem cells, cancer cells, and microorganisms) and dissociated solid tissues (e.g., lymph nodes, spleen, and solid tumors) with typical throughputs of 1,000-100,000 events per second (eps). By measuring cell size, cell granularity, and the expression of cell surface and intracellular molecules, it provides systematic insights into biological processes. Flow cytometers may also include cell sorting capabilities to enable subsequent additional analysis of the sorted sample (e.g., electron microscopy and DNA/RNA sequencing), cloning, and directed evolution. Unfortunately, traditional flow cytometry has several critical limitations as it mainly relies on fluorescent labeling for cellular phenotyping, which is an indirect measure of intracellular molecules and surface antigens. Furthermore, it often requires time-consuming preparation protocols and is incompatible with cell therapy. To overcome these difficulties, a different type of flow cytometry based on direct measurements of intracellular molecules by Raman spectroscopy, or ""Raman flow cytometry"" for short, has emerged. Raman flow cytometry obtains a chemical fingerprint of the cell in a nondestructive manner, allowing for single-cell metabolic phenotyping. However, its slow signal acquisition due to the weak light-molecule interaction of spontaneous Raman scattering prevents the throughput necessary to interrogate large cell populations in reasonable time frames, resulting in throughputs of about 1 eps. The remedy to this throughput limit lies in coherent Raman scattering methods such as stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), which offer a significantly enhanced light-sample interaction and hence enable high-throughput Raman flow cytometry, Raman imaging flow cytometry, and even Raman image-activated cell sorting (RIACS). In this Account, we outline recent advances, technical challenges, and emerging opportunities of coherent Raman flow cytometry. First, we review the principles of various types of SRS and CARS and introduce several techniques of coherent Raman flow cytometry such as CARS, multiplex CARS, Fourier-transform CARS, SRS, SRS imaging flow cytometry, and RIACS. Next, we discuss a unique set of applications enabled by coherent Raman flow cytometry, from microbiology and lipid biology to cancer detection and cell therapy. Finally, we describe future opportunities and challenges of coherent Raman flow cytometry including increasing sensitivity and throughput, integration with droplet microfluidics, utilizing machine learning techniques, or achieving in vivo flow cytometry. This Account summarizes the growing field of high-throughput Raman flow cytometry and the bright future it can bring.",nocancer
"Propofol, a commonly used intravenous anesthetic in tumor surgery, has recently garnered attention for its anti-cancer activity. We previously demonstrated that propofol inhibits migration and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. However, the effects of propofol in tumor angiogenesis are inconclusive. The current study investigated the effects of propofol on the biological functions of lung cancer associated endothelial cells (LC-EC) and colon cancer associated endothelial cells (CC-EC) that represent in vitro tumor angiogenesis. We showed that propofol inhibited tubular structure formation of both LC-EC and CC-EC, particularly the early stages of angiogenesis. In addition, propofol inhibited migration, adhesion, proliferation, and survival of tumor associated endothelial cells. Mechanism studies revealed that propofol disrupted tumor angiogenesis microenvironment via suppressing expression and secretion of multiple pro-angiogenic factors by tumor cells. Propofol also inhibited VEGF/VEGFR2-and mTOR/eIF4E-mediated signaling pathways in endothelial cells. Our findings demonstrate the inhibitory effects of propofol on tumor angiogenesis and support the anti-cancer properties of propofol. Our work provides preclinical evidence into the potential mechanisms by which propofol may negatively affect tumor growth and metastasis.",nocancer
"Angioedema stems from increased vasodilation and vascular permeability, resulting in extravasation of fluid. Hereditary and acquired types of angioedema can be distinguished, with 3 and 4 subtypes, respectively. Groups of medicaments potentially inducing angioedema are, among others: ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors and immunosuppressive agents. Urticaria is characterised by red, slightly raised swellings, usually associated with a strong itching sensation and can be subdivided in an acute and a chronic type. Mast cells in the uppermost layer of the skin or the mucous membranes release a lot of histamine, increasing the dilation and permeability of blood capillaries, resulting in extravasation of fluid. Medicaments potentially inducing urticaria are, among others, the following groups: analgesics, anaesthetics, antibiotics, antidepressants, antihistamines, antihypertensives, antifungals, corticosteroids, H2 blockers, cancer medicaments, muscle relaxants, thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors and vaccines. Medical history and being alert when administering and prescribing anaesthetics, analgesics and antibiotics are very important in the prevention or treatment of angioedema and/or urticaria.",nocancer
"Colibactin is a secondary metabolite encoded by the pks gene island identified in several Enterobacteriaceae, including some pathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) commonly enriched in mucosal tissue collected from patients with inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. E. coli harboring this biosynthetic gene cluster cause DNA damage and tumorigenesis in cell lines and pre-clinical models, yet fundamental knowledge regarding colibactin function is lacking. To accurately assess the role of pks+&nbsp;E. coli in cancer etiology, the biological mechanisms governing production and delivery of colibactin by these bacteria must be elucidated. In this review, we will focus on recent advances in our understanding of colibactin's structural mode-of-action and mutagenic potential with consideration for how this activity may be regulated by physiologic conditions within the intestine.",nocancer
"Mushrooms are consumed for their nutrients and therapeutic bioactive compounds and are used medicinally in Chinese and Japanese medicine traditions since time immemorial. Members of the genus Pleurotus form a heterogeneous group of edible species with outstanding nutritional profiles rich in fiber, vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, ascorbic acid, ergosterine, and niacin), micro and macro-elements (phosphorus and iron), and carbohydrates. Pleurotus is one of the most diversified medicinal and edible mushrooms related to the composition of chemical structures such as polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and secondary metabolites such as alkaloids and betalains. The cultivation of Pleurotus spp. on lignocellulosic wastes represents one of the most economically and cost-effective organic recycling processes, especially for the utilization of different feasible and cheap recyclable residues. Also, several Pleurotus spp. have the ability to remove phenolic compounds from wastewater with the action of phenoloxidase activity. Here, we have reviewed the chemistry of such polysaccharides and their reported biological activities, namely, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, anti-diabetic, anti-tumor, antioxidant, etc. The mechanism of action and effects of novel polysaccharides extracted from various species of Pleurotus have been studied. The current study will be beneficial for guiding future research projects on the above concept and investigating more deeply the health of human beings. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Mushrooms are one of the most delicious foods around the globe and have many medicinal properties for decades. Various Pleurotus species have been in focus in recent years because of their palatability and medicinal importance too. It contains many bioactive compounds among which polysaccharides are valued to a great extent. Many biological activities are exerted by polysaccharides derived from the Pleurotus spp., namely, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and many more. They are responsible for significant physiological responses in animals, animal-alternative in vitro models, and humans. Their important physicochemical characteristics benefit their use in the food industry as well. So, the biological activities of these Pleurotus spp. polysaccharides will provide an insight to develop Pleurotus spp. as functional foods, because of their nutritional value and presence of bioactive components.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To determine the difference in force metrics measured by the laryngeal force sensor for various suspension microlaryngoscopy (SML) procedures and their perioperative narcotic requirements. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Academic tertiary center. METHODS: The laryngeal force sensoris a force sensor designed for SML procedures. Prospectively enrolled patients had dynamic recordings of maximum force, average force, suspension time, and total impulse. Procedures were grouped into excision of striking zone lesions, nonstriking zone lesions, endoscopic cancer surgery with margin control, and airway dilation. Narcotic administration in the intraoperative period and postanesthesia care unit was also recorded and converted into IV morphine equivalents. Surgeons were blinded to the force recordings during surgery to prevent operator bias. RESULTS: In total, 110 patients completed the study. There was no significant difference in average force across different procedures, however, a significant difference was seen for maximum force (P = 0.025), suspension time (P &lt; 0.001), and total impulse (P = 0.002). The highest values were seen for endoscopic cancer surgeries with margin control with a mean maximum force of 49.4 lbf (95%CI, 37.1-61.7), mean suspension time of 60.2 minutes (95%CI, 40.5-79.9), and mean total impulse of 31.3 ton*s (95%CI, 15.2-47.3). A significant difference (P &lt; 0.01) in perioperative narcotic requirements was also seen, with endoscopic cancer surgery cases having the highest requirements at 27.6 mg of ME (95%CI, 16.1-39.2 mg). CONCLUSION: Significant differences in force metrics exist between various SML procedures. Endoscopic cancer surgery is associated with higher force metrics and perioperative narcotic requirements.",nocancer

As such, small molecule autophagy modulators are in great demand, both for their ability to act as tools to better understand this essential process and as potential therapeutics. Despite substantial advances in the field, major challenges remain in the development and comprehensive characterization of probes that are specific to autophagy. In this Review, we discuss recent developments in autophagy-modulating small molecules, including the specific challenges faced in the development of activators and inhibitors, and recommend guidelines for their use. Finally, we discuss the potential to hijack the process for targeted protein degradation, an area of great importance in chemical biology and drug discovery.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: The ATX-LPA axis is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in a variety of diseases, such as tumor metastasis, fibrosis, pruritus, multiple sclerosis, inflammation, autoimmune conditions, metabolic syndrome and so on. Accordingly, considerable efforts have been devoted to the development of new chemical entities capable of modulating the ATX-LPA axis. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to provide an overview of novel ATX inhibitors reported in patents from September 2016 to August 2020, discussing their structural characteristics and inhibitory potency in vitro and in vivo. EXPERT OPINION: In the past four years, classification of ATX inhibitors based on binding modes has brought great benefits on the discovery of more efficacious inhibitors. In addition to GLPG1690 currently in phase III clinical studies for IPF, BBT-877 and BLD-0409 as potent ATX inhibitors have been enrolled in phase I clinical evaluation, meanwhile, many effective molecules were also reported successively. However, most emerging ATX inhibitors in the last four years are closely analogs of previous entities, such as GLPG1690 and PF-8380, which translate into the urgently identification of ATX inhibitors with diverse structural features and promising properties in the near future.",nocancer

Following the structure of the EBM hierarchy, we chose at least one study for each step of the pyramid from the basis (pre-clinical research, expert opinion, case report and case series), to the middle (case-control and cohort studies, randomised controlled trials), towards the top (meta-analyses and systematic reviews). Additionally, we collected information on the promoter of each included study: investigator-initiated trials (IITs) vs industry-sponsored trials (ISTs). We found that pre-clinical studies are primarily focused on the development of novel molecular targets in cancer, with promising results. At the same time, clinical investigations deal with cardiological, neurological, infectious and oncological applications using both SPECT and PET modalities. Additionally, radionuclide therapy gained interest and is experiencing comprehensive clinical implementation. Our overview confirms the current central role of IITs as compared with ISTs.

"CONTEXT: Survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHCT) may experience cognitive impairment over time post-treatment, but early identification of these individuals is limited. OBJECTIVES: We previously reported a prospective evaluation of cognitive functioning over the first 6 months of alloHCT. Here, we report an extension of this study, with specific aims to (1) evaluate the trajectory of cognitive outcomes over the first 6 years post-alloHCT, and (2) determine the extent to which late cognitive impairment is predicted by earlier impairment. METHODS: Participants completed objective and subjective cognitive measures before alloHCT, and at 100 days, 6 months, and 6 years post-alloHCT. Outcome trajectories were determined using linear mixed effects models. Relationships between early and late cognitive impairment were assessed using logistic regression and receiver operator curves. RESULTS: This analysis is based on longitudinal data from 59 participants, of whom 20 provided data at 6-year follow-up. Longitudinal models revealed an overall stability of cognitive outcomes over time, except for psychomotor efficiency/processing speed performance, which significantly improved (p = .049). However, poor learning/memory and cognitive complaints were persistently observed. At 6 years, 40% of relapse-free survivors met the impairment criteria. Impairment at 100 days was associated with impairment 6 years (OR = 20.00, p = .028) and demonstrated good accuracy in classifying those who were impaired and not impaired at 6 years (AUC = .79; 95% CI = .56-1.00). CONCLUSION: Poor cognitive outcomes among long-term alloHCT survivors are associated with cognitive functioning during the early post-treatment period. Early identification of survivors likely to experience poor cognitive outcomes may be possible, enabling timely intervention to mitigate long-term negative impacts.",nocancer
"The B subunit pentamer verotoxin (VT aka Shiga toxin-Stx) binding to its cellular glycosphingolipid (GSL) receptor, globotriaosyl ceramide (Gb3) mediates internalization and the subsequent receptor mediated retrograde intracellular traffic of the AB5 subunit holotoxin to the endoplasmic reticulum. Subunit separation and cytosolic A subunit transit via the ER retrotranslocon as a misfolded protein mimic, then inhibits protein synthesis to kill cells, which can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome clinically. This represents one of the most studied systems of prokaryotic hijacking of eukaryotic biology. Similarly, the interaction of cholera AB5 toxin with its GSL receptor, GM1 ganglioside, is the key component of the gastrointestinal pathogenesis of cholera and follows the same retrograde transport pathway for A subunit cytosol access. Although both VT and CT are the cause of major pathology worldwide, the toxin-receptor interaction is itself being manipulated to generate new approaches to control, rather than cause, disease. This arena comprises two areas: anti neoplasia, and protein misfolding diseases. CT/CTB subunit immunomodulatory function and anti-cancer toxin immunoconjugates will not be considered here. In the verotoxin case, it is clear that Gb3 (and VT targeting) is upregulated in many human cancers and that there is a relationship between GSL expression and cancer drug resistance. While both verotoxin and cholera toxin similarly hijack the intracellular ERAD quality control system of nascent protein folding, the more widespread cell expression of GM1 makes cholera the toxin of choice as the means to more widely utilise ERAD targeting to ameliorate genetic diseases of protein misfolding. Gb3 is primarily expressed in human renal tissue. Glomerular endothelial cells are the primary VT target but Gb3 is expressed in other endothelial beds, notably brain endothelial cells which can mediate the encephalopathy primarily associated with VT2-producing E. coli infection. The Gb3 levels can be regulated by cytokines released during EHEC infection, which complicate pathogenesis. Significantly Gb3 is upregulated in the neovasculature of many tumours, irrespective of tumour Gb3 status. Gb3 is markedly increased in pancreatic, ovarian, breast, testicular, renal, astrocytic, gastric, colorectal, cervical, sarcoma and meningeal cancer relative to the normal tissue. VT has been shown to be effective in mouse xenograft models of renal, astrocytoma, ovarian, colorectal, meningioma, and breast cancer. These studies are herein reviewed. Both CT and VT (and several other bacterial toxins) access the cell cytosol via cell surface ->ER transport. Once in the ER they interface with the protein folding homeostatic quality control pathway of the cell -ERAD, (ER associated degradation), which ensures that only correctly folded nascent proteins are allowed to progress to their cellular destinations. Misfolded proteins are translocated through the ER membrane and degraded by cytosolic proteosome. VT and CT A subunits have a C terminal misfolded protein mimic sequence to hijack this transporter to enter the cytosol. This interface between exogenous toxin and genetically encoded endogenous mutant misfolded proteins, provides a new therapeutic basis for the treatment of such genetic diseases, e.g., Cystic fibrosis, Gaucher disease, Krabbe disease, Fabry disease, Tay-Sachs disease and many more. Studies showing the efficacy of this approach in animal models of such diseases are presented.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: During the state of alarm established in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the face-to-face outpatient consultations were cancelled and a telephone consultation was established to follow up coloproctological patients. The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. RESULTS: From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. CONCLUSION: In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients. The new social and health paradigm after the pandemic will require a rethinking of our healthcare model, and in many aspects, telemedicine can offer tools for this.",nocancer
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To incorporate novel findings on pathophysiology and treatment of posttransplant hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: (1) The sodium retaining effects of CNIs are mediated by stimulation of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride co-transporter in the distal convoluted tubule and in this regard chlorthalidone was proven to be an effective antihypertensive drug in renal transplantation. (2) Local and not systemic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of posttransplant hypertension. (3) Recent randomized controlled trials failed to prove the presumed superiority of renin-angiotensin blockers in kidney transplantation. (4) Steroid-free and mammalian target of rapamycin-based immunosuppressive drug combinations did not show favorable effects on blood pressure control. (5) In a recent report the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer was higher with thiazide diuretics. But the increased cancer risk in transplant recipients is mainly attributed to comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension and of course to the transplantation condition itself or the obligatory application of immunosuppression, and has little to do with the antihypertensive medication Actual recommendations about BP targets in adult renal transplant recipients are coming from a post hoc analysis of a large randomized trial with another primary endpoint. Unless convincing studies on treatment of hypertension after renal transplantation are available, the ESC/ESH Guidelines 2018 should apply for these patients.",nocancer
"African American women (AAW) experience higher burdens of disease and have the highest rate of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes when compared to females of other ethnic groups. Health narratives are a communication strategy that has been used to improve population health outcomes. Narrative storytelling is considered to be effective for improving health outcomes in African Americans because of the strong cultural storytelling background. The purpose of this study was to determine if health narratives have a significant effect on persuasion among AAW, as measured by changes in attitudes, beliefs, intentions, and behaviors. Meta-analysis of health narrative experiments (k = 13) for AAW (N = 2,746) revealed that health narratives have a significant overall effect on persuasion (d = .243; p < .01). Sub-group analyses revealed no significant difference between audio-visual and written-based narratives, and no significant difference between general health topics and cancer topics. Narrative communication was effective for promoting health in AAW. These findings imply that narratives can effectively be used as an audio-visual or written-based communication for AAW, and that health topic may not impact outcomes of narrative communication.",nocancer
"Indoor air pollution sources with emissions of fine particles (PM2.5), including environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and incense smoke (IS) deteriorate indoor air quality and may cause respiratory diseases in humans. This study characterized the emission factors (EFs) of five types of tobacco and incense in Hong Kong using an environmental chamber. Human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to PM2.5 collected from different indoor sources to determine their cytotoxicity. The PM2.5 EF of ETS (109.7+-36.5 mg/g) was higher than IS (97.1+-87.3 mg/g). The EFs of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonyls for IS were higher than ETS, and these two combustion sources showed similar distributions of individual PAHs and carbonyls. Oxidative damage and inflammatory responses (i.e. DNA damage, 8-hydroxy-desoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interlukin-6 (IL-6)) of A549 cells was triggered by exposure to PM2.5 generated from ETS and IS. Different indoor sources showed different responses to oxidative stress and inflammations due to the accumulation effects of mixed organic compounds. High molecular weight PAHs from incense combustion showed higher correlations with DNA damage markers, and most of the PAHs from indoor sources demonstrated significant correlations with inflammation. Exposure to anthropogenic produced combustion emissions such as ETS and IS results in significant risks (e.g. lung cancer) to the alveolar epithelium within the distal human respiratory tract, of which incense emissions posed a higher cytotoxicity.",nocancer
"Exosomes are small vesicles with an average diameter of 100 nm that are produced by many, if not all, cell types. Exosome cargo includes lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids arranged specifically in the endosomes of donor cells. Exosomes can transfer the donor cell components to target cells and can affect cell signaling, proliferation, and differentiation. Important new information about exosomes' remote communication with other cells is rapidly being accumulated. Recent data indicates that the results of this communication depend on the donor cell type and the environment of the host cell. In the field of cancer research, major questions remain, such as whether tumor cell exosomes are equally taken up by cancer cells and normal cells and whether exosomes secreted by normal cells are specifically taken up by other normal cells or also tumor cells. Furthermore, we do not know how exosome uptake is made selective, how we can trace exosome uptake selectivity, or what the most appropriate methods are to study exosome uptake and selectivity. This review will explain the effect of exosome source and the impact of the donor cell growth environment on tumor and normal cell interaction and communication. The review will also summarize the methods that have been used to label and trace exosomes to date.",nocancer
"ABSTRACT: Soft tissue deficits of the scalp due to trauma, infection, or tumor resection present a unique challenge to the reconstructive surgeon whose goal is to achieve excellent cosmesis in a hair bearing area without compromising coverage. While extensive undermining for large rotation flaps or free tissue transfer can provide necessary coverage, the pericranial flap is an excellent alternative for less ideal surgical candidates who cannot tolerate more extensive interventions or for patients who require long-term cancer surveillance. Elevation of the pericranial flap limits the need for back cuts through the skin and uses blunt dissection to preserve overlying hair follicles. Here we present a review of the anatomy and historical use of the pericranial flap for scalp coverage and we present 4 cases to demonstrate its current utility.",nocancer
"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Our comparative analysis sought to understand the factors which drive differences in fish consumption advisories across the USA - including exposure scenarios (acute and chronic health risk, non-cancer and cancer health endpoints), toxicity values (reference dose, cancer slope factor, acute tolerance level), and meal size and bodyweight assumptions. RECENT FINDINGS: Fish consumption provides essential nutrients but also results in exposure to contaminants such as PCBs and methylmercury. To protect consumers from the risks of fish contaminants, fish consumption advisories are established, most often by state jurisdictions, to estimate the amount of a certain fish species a person could consume throughout their lifetime without harm. However, inconsistencies in advisories across the USA confuse consumers and undermine the public health goals of fish advisory programs. To date, no rigorous comparison of state and national fish consumption advisories has been reported. Our work identifies discrepancies in key assumptions used to derive risk-based advisories between US states, reflecting differences in the interpretation of toxicity science. We also address the implications for these differences by reviewing advisories issued by contiguous states bordering two waterbodies: Lake Michigan and the Lower Mississippi River. Our findings highlight the importance of regional collaboration when issuing advisories, so that consumers of self-caught fish are equipped with clear knowledge to make decisions to protect their health.",nocancer
"Exosomes are a subset of extracellular vesicles essential for cell-cell communication in health and disease with the ability to transport nucleic acids, functional proteins and other metabolites. Their clinical use as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic carriers has become a major field of research over recent years, generating rapidly expanding scientific interest and financial investment. Their reduced immunogenicity compared to liposomes or viral vectors and their ability to cross major physiological barriers like the blood-brain barrier make them an appealing and innovative option as biomarkers and therapeutic agents. Here, we review the latest clinical developments of exosome biotechnology for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, including the most recent COVID-19 related exosome-based clinical trials. We present current exosome engineering strategies for optimal clinical safety and efficacy and assess the technology developed for GMP compliant scaling up and storage approaches along with their limitations in pharmaceutical industry.",nocancer
"The dietary modification (DM) clinical trial, within the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), studied a low-fat dietary pattern intervention that included guidance to increase vegetables, fruit, and grains. This study was motivated in part from uncertainty about the reliability of observational studies examining the association between dietary fat and chronic disease risk by using self-reported dietary data. In addition to this large trial, which had breast and colorectal cancer as its primary outcomes, a substantial biomarker research effort was initiated midway in the WHI program to contribute to nutritional epidemiology research more broadly. Here we review and update findings from the DM trial and from the WHI nutritional biomarker studies and examine implications for future nutritional epidemiology research. The WHI included the randomized controlled DM trial (n = 48,835) and a prospective cohort observational (OS) study (n = 93,676), both among postmenopausal US women, aged 50-79 y when enrolled during 1993-1998. Also reviewed is a nutrition and physical activity assessment study in a subset of 450 OS participants (2007-2009) and a related controlled feeding study among 153 WHI participants (2010-2014). Long-term follow-up in the DM trial provides evidence for intervention-related reductions in breast cancer mortality, diabetes requiring insulin, and coronary artery disease in the subset of normotensive healthy women, without observed adverse effects or changes in all-cause mortality. Studies of intake biomarkers, and of biomarker-calibrated intake, suggest important associations of total energy intake and macronutrient dietary composition with the risk for major chronic diseases among postmenopausal women. Collectively these studies argue for a nutrition epidemiology research agenda that includes major efforts in nutritional biomarker development, and in the application of biomarkers combined with self-reported dietary data in disease association analyses. We expect such efforts to yield novel disease association findings and to inform disease prevention approaches for potential testing in dietary intervention trials. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000611.",nocancer
"ABSTRACT: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are amongst the most commonly prescribed drugs in infants and children with the last decades witnessing a dramatic rise in their utilization. Although PPIs are clearly effective when used appropriately and have been regarded as safe drugs, there is growing evidence regarding their potential adverse effects. Although, largely based on adult data it is clear that many of these are also relevant to pediatrics. PPI use potentially affects gastrointestinal microbiota composition and function, decreases defence against pathogens resulting in increased risk for infections, interferes with absorption of minerals and vitamins leading to specific deficiencies and increased risk for bone fractures as well as interferes with protein digestion resulting in increased risk of sensitization to allergens and development of allergic diseases and eosinophilic esophagitis. An association with gastric, liver and pancreatic cancer has also been inferred from adult data but is tenuous and causation is not proven. Overall, evidence for these adverse events is patchy and not always compelling. Overall, the use of PPIs, for selected indications with a good evidence base, has significant potential benefit but carries more caution in infants and children. Pediatricians should be aware of the concerns regarding the potential adverse events associated with their use.",nocancer
"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is a well-known disease-related biomarker associated with fibrotic diseases, and initiation and progression of cancer in many organs. Therefore, quantitative and sensitive detection of TGF-beta and similar biomarkers is crucial for patient treatment in the early stages of diagnosis. In many studies, the detection of TGF-beta, an important profibrotic and cancer promoting cytokine, has been generally conducted by fluorescence or absorbance-based immunoassays. However, conventional methods for detecting TGF-beta have problems including use of time-consuming sample pretreatment steps and multiple reagents for signal amplification and difficulty in real-time detection from living cells. Herein, we present a plasmon-based immunoassay for TGF-beta using antibody-conjugated single gold nanoparticles that act as optically excellent intracellular and extracellular detection probes that do not require additional signal amplification. To detect TGF-beta sensitively and selectively, we exploited the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property of antibody-conjugated plasmonic gold nanoparticles at a single particle level. By measuring the LSPR spectral shifts of the single plasmonic nanoprobes, TGF-beta can be detected down to the picomolar level, which is comparable with the conventional methods but without significant interference from other proteins. The optimized plasmonic nanoprobes were applied to quantify and monitor the extracellular TGF-beta level secreted from the cells under stress conditions, such as cancer, and exposure to toxic environments. Owing to the ease of cellular internalization of the nanoprobes, we directly image and detect increases in intracellular TGF-beta levels in living cells under the given stress conditions without cell lysis. We envision that this strategy of using individual nanoparticles as sensors to monitor protein biomarkers in living cells could be applied for various biological assays and diagnosis.",nocancer
"Tumor angiogenesis plays a vital role in tumor growth and metastasis. It is proven that in tumor vasculature, endothelial cells (ECs) originate from a small population of cancer cells introduced as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Autophagy has a vital role in ECs differentiation from CSCs and tumor angiogenesis. High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased autophagy by inhibition of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and inactivation of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Previously, we suggested that cancer cells initially increase the glycolysis rate when encountering ROS, then the metabolic balance is changed from glycolysis to PPP, following the continuation of oxidative stress. In this study, we investigate the possible role of persistent oxidative stress in the differentiation of CSCs into tumor ECs by relying on the relationship between the ROS, PPP and autophagy. Because tumor angiogenesis plays an important role in the growth and development of cancer, understanding the mechanisms involved in differentiating ECs from CSCs can help find promising treatments for cancer.",nocancer
"Stem cells (SCs) are clonogenic cells that develop into the specialized cells which later responsible for making up various types of tissue in the human body. SCs are not only the appropriate source of information for cell division, molecular and cellular processes, and tissue homeostasis but also one of the major putative biological aids to diagnose and cure various degenerative diseases. This study emphasises on various research outputs that occurred in the past two decades. This will give brief information on classification, differentiation, detection, and various isolation techniques of SCs. Here, the various signalling pathways which includes WNT, Sonic hedgehog, Notch, BMI1 and C-met pathways and how does it effect on the regeneration of various classes of SCs and factors that regulates the potency of the SCs are also been discussed. We also focused on the application of SCs in the area of regenerative medicine along with the cellular markers that are useful as salient diagnostic or curative tools or in both, by the process of reprogramming, which includes diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disorders and neurological disorders. The biomarkers that are mentioned in various literatures and experiments include PDX1, FOXA2, HNF6, and NKX6-1 (for diabetes); CD33, CD24, CD133 (for cancer); c-Kit, SCA-1, Wilm's tumor 1 (for cardiovascular disorders); and OCT4, SOX2, c-MYC, EN1, DAT and VMAT2 (for neurological disorders). In this review, we come to know the advancements and scopes of potential SC-based therapies, its diverse applications in clinical fields that can be helpful in the near future.",nocancer
"Increasing numbers of patients are undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); however, further characterization of late kidney outcomes in HCT recipients is needed. This study investigated long-term kidney outcomes in HCT survivors and compared the risk of late kidney morbidity/mortality in these survivors with that in non-HCT cancer survivors and the general population. A cohort of long-term (>=2 years) allogeneic and autologous HCT survivors treated for cancer at our institution between 1992 and 2009 (n = 1792) was compared with a non-HCT cancer cohort selected from the state cancer registry (n = 5455) matched on diagnosis, sex, and age at year of cancer diagnosis/HCT (index date). Additional comparisons were made with a matched general population sample drawn from state driver's licensing files (DOL; n = 16,340). Statewide hospital discharge codes and death registry codes (International Classification of Diseases 9/10) were used to identify cases of acute kidney failure (AKF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) occurring >=2 years after the index date. Cumulative incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs; according to multivariable proportional hazard models) estimated the absolute and relative risks of AKF and CKD. Among HCT survivors, we examined the influence of additional characteristics including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at 1-year post-HCT. The cumulative incidence rates of late kidney complications were slightly greater in the HCT survivors versus the non-HCT cancer survivors at 10 years after the index date. Both groups were more likely to experience late AKF or CKD morbidity/mortality compared with the general population (AKF: HCT, 9.4%; non-HCT, 7.7%; DOL, 1.8%; CKD: HCT, 5.7%; non-HCT, 5.0%; DOL, 1.2%). Differences between HCT survivors and non-HCT survivors were seen primarily starting 5 years after the index date, with increased hazards for late AKF (HR, 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1 to 1.9) and CKD (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.8). Among allogeneic HCT survivors, the presence of hypertension at <2 years post-HCT was significantly associated with subsequent AKF (HR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.7 to 5.0) and CKD (HR, 5.2; 95% CI, 2.7 to 10.0) at 2 to 10 years post-HCT, with similar associations seen for autologous HCT survivors. Low eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) at 1 year post-HCT was associated with late AKF morbidity/mortality for both allogeneic (HR, 5.3; 95% CI, 2.1 to 13.2) and autologous HCT (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 6.3) compared with survivors with normal eGFR (>90 mL/min/1.73 m2). Overall, the risk for hospitalization or death from AKF or CKD continued to increase with time from HCT and exceeded that of non-HCT cancer survivors at >5 years after treatment. Appropriate screening and early intervention with medication adjustments or lifestyle modifications in those with hypertension or evidence of abnormal eGFR post-HCT could potentially mitigate this risk.",nocancer
"Steroid sulphatase (STS), involved in the hydrolysis of steroid sulphates, plays an important role in the formation of both active oestrogens and androgens. Since these steroids significantly impact the proliferation of both oestrogen- and androgen-dependent cancers, many research groups over the past 30 years have designed and developed STS inhibitors. One of the main contributors to this field has been Prof. Barry Potter, previously at the University of Bath and now at the University of Oxford. Upon Prof. Potter's imminent retirement, this review takes a look back at the work on STS inhibitors and their contribution to our understanding of sulphate biology and as potential therapeutic agents in hormone-dependent disease. A number of potent STS inhibitors have now been developed, one of which, Irosustat (STX64, 667Coumate, BN83495), remains the only one to have completed phase I/II clinical trials against numerous indications (breast, prostate, endometrial). These studies have provided new insights into the origins of androgens and oestrogens in women and men. In addition to the therapeutic role of STS inhibition in breast and prostate cancer, there is now good evidence to suggest they may also provide benefits in patients with colorectal and ovarian cancer, and in treating endometriosis. To explore the potential of STS inhibitors further, a number of second- and third-generation inhibitors have been developed, together with single molecules that possess aromatase-STS inhibitory properties. The further development of potent STS inhibitors will allow their potential therapeutic value to be explored in a variety of hormone-dependent cancers and possibly other non-oncological conditions.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Chronic rhinosinusitis is currently classified into two types: chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. In the West, approximately 80% of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps cases are characterized by a predominantly eosinophilic cell infiltrate and a Th2 cytokine pattern. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Interferon-alpha on cytokine levels of the eosinophilic nasal polyp cell culture supernatant. METHODS: Cell cultures were performed based on nasal polypoid tissue samples collected from 13 patients with eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps. Polyps were considered eosinophilic according to the histopathological examination. Cell cultures were stimulated with 3000 IU of interferon-alpha. Before and after the stimulus, concentrations of Interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alphaand IL 2, 4, 6 and 10, using cytometric bead array, were assessed. RESULTS: Cell samples from eosinophilic nasal polyps from 13 patients were included in the study. Twenty-four hours after interferon-alpha stimulation, eosinophilic nasal polyp culture supernatants showed significantly decreased IL-4 concentrations and increase in interferon-gamma, IL-10 and IL-6 concentrations compared to controls. There were no significant differences in tumor necrosis factor -alpha and IL-2 concentrations. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that interferon-alpha in vitro alters the pattern of cytokines in cell cultures of eosinophilic nasal polyps. Analysis of these alterations suggests that interferon-alpha promotes a rebalancing of inflammatory profiles in cell cultures, favoring the expression of Th1 and regulatory cytokines over Th2 cytokines.",nocancer
"Protein kinases belong to the largest family of enzymes controlling every aspect of cellular activity including gene expression, cell division, differentiation and metabolism. They are part of major intracellular signalling pathways. Hence, it is not surprising that they are involved in the development of major diseases such as cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, dementia and, most importantly, cancer when they undergo mutations, modifications and unbalanced expression. This review will explore the possibility to draw a connection between the application of natural phytochemicals and the treatment of cancer.

"Formaldehyde (FA) is a naturally-occurring compound, produced endogenously in diverse living organisms. It also occurs widely in the environment due to anthropogenic (e.g. used as a chemical intermediate) and natural sources (e.g. a component of the volatile organic compounds blends emitted by plants). While FA is considered a potential carcinogen, living organisms have the ability to cope with FA, and some minimum endogenous levels of FA may be required for health. Recently, genetic engineering approaches transferring biological information from one organism to another led to increased assimilation of and conferred genetic-based tolerance to FA in plants-microorganisms systems. Here, we proposed that FA commonly induces hormesis, a hypothesis that we confirm by collating evidence from various published studies with animals, plants, and microorganisms. The stimulation by low doses below the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was modest in magnitude, in agreement with the general hormesis literature. In plants, among the endpoints showing hormesis were growth, lipid peroxidation, and photosynthetic pigments. In various animal cells, hormesis was observed in cell proliferation and viability, responses that were related to mechanisms, such as activation of phosphorylated ERK (extra-cellular signaling-regulated kinase) expression, acceleration of the process of cell division, and enhancement of the Warburg effect (i.e. use of glycolysis by tumor cells to produce energy for rapid growth). Hormetic in vitro responses were reported in several cancerous/tumorous cell lines, suggesting that FA has the potential to influence tumor promotion within a specific concentration range and biological context. These observations suggest that FA commonly acts in an hormetic manner with implications for study designs across a broad range of biological model and in the assessment of environmental and human risks associated with FA exposures.",nocancer

"Various physiological characteristics of the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as hypoxia, overexpression of glutathione (GSH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and mild acidity, can severely reduce the efficacy of many cancer therapies. Altering the redox balance of the TME and increasing oxidative stress can accordingly enhance the efficacy of tumor therapy. Herein, we developed a bismuth-based Cu2+-doped BiOCl nanotherapeutic platform, BCHN, able to self-supply H2O2 for TME-regulated chemodynamic therapy (CDT) combined with sensitized radiotherapy (RT). BCHN released H2O2 and consumed GSH to degrade the composite in the slightly acidic TME, and generated hydroxyl radicals ( OH) via a Fenton-like reaction catalyzed by copper ions, to achieve oxidative stress-enhanced CDT. The Fenton-like reaction also catalyzed H2O2 to produce O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia, and combined with the X-ray-blocking property of bismuth to realize TME-enhanced radiotherapy. Synergistic CDT/RT has previously been shown to effectively inhibit tumor cell proliferation and achieve effective tumor control. The current results demonstrated a highly efficient multifunctional bio-degradable nanoplatform for oncotherapy.",nocancer
"Gasdermins were recently identified as the mediators of pyroptosis - inflammatory cell death triggered by cytosolic sensing of invasive infection and danger signals.

"PURPOSE: Explore acceptability of vaccines in development: cancer, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Lyme disease, Ebola, and obesity. Research questions: To what extent does acceptability vary by vaccine type? To what extent does acceptability of vaccines in development vary by race and other key demographics? To what extent are general vaccine hesitancy and key demographics associated with acceptability of vaccines in development? DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey administered through GfK's KnowledgePanel in 2015. Analysis completed in 2020. SUBJECTS: Nationally representative sample of Black and White American adults (n = 1,643). MEASURES: Willingness to accept a novel vaccine was measured on a 4-point Likert scale. Independent variables included demographics (e.g. age, race, gender) and measures of vaccine hesitancy, trust, and the ""Three C's"" of vaccine confidence, complacency, and convenience. ANALYSIS: Exploratory analysis including descriptive statistics and regression modeling. RESULTS: Acceptability varied from 77% for a cancer vaccine to 55% for an obesity vaccine. White race, male gender, older age, having a chronic health condition, and higher socioeconomic status were associated with higher acceptability. Higher vaccine confidence and lower vaccine hesitancy were predictors for acceptability. CONCLUSION: The success of a vaccine depends on widespread public acceptance. Vaccine hesitancy may hinder acceptance of future vaccines, with significant differences by demographics.

"G-quadruplexes have raised considerable interest during the past years for the development of therapies against cancer. These noncanonical structures of DNA may be found in telomeres and/or oncogene promoters, and it has been observed that the stabilization of such G-quadruplexes may disturb tumor cell growth. Nevertheless, the mechanisms leading to folding and stabilization of these G-quadruplexes are still not well established, and they are the focus of much current work in this field. In seminal works, stabilization was observed to be produced by cations. However, subsequent studies showed that different kinds of small molecules, from planar and nonplanar organic molecules to square-planar and octahedral metal complexes, may also lead to the stabilization of G-quadruplexes. Thus, the comprehension and rationalization of the interaction of these small molecules with G-quadruplexes are also important topics of current interest in medical applications. To shed light on the questions arising from the literature on the formation of G-quadruplexes, their stabilization, and their interaction with small molecules, synergies between experimental studies and computational works are needed. In this review, we mainly focus on in silico approaches and provide a broad compilation of different leading studies carried out to date by different computational methods. We divide these methods into two main categories: (a) classical methods, which allow for long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and the corresponding analysis of dynamical information, and (b) quantum methods (semiempirical, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, and density functional theory methods), which allow for the explicit simulation of the electronic structure of the system but, in general, are not capable of being used in long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations and, therefore, give a more static picture of the relevant processes.

"Oil-based drill cuttings (OBDCs) were managed in two scenarios including low-temperature thermal desorption (LTTD) and secure landfill through a case study. The removal of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals in OBDCs by LTTD under different conditions was investigated. Probabilistic human health risk assessment was performed to quantify the health risk posed to waste management workers under the two scenarios, while the associated costs were also analyzed. The results show that LTTD at 300  C for >20 min could remove 96.27% of PAHs in OBDCs but its removal effect on heavy metals was not significant. It was found that cancer risks posed by PAHs in both securely landfilled and LTTD-treated OBDCs were not significant (<1e-06); however, significant cancer risks (7.95e-05-9.45e-05) were identified for exposure to toxic heavy metals. Increased health risk was observed as a result of exposure to LTTD treatment residues compared to securely landfilled OBDCs. Inhalation of chromium(VI) and oral ingestion of arsenic in OBDCs were critical exposure routes. Both cancer and non-cancer risks in the secure landfill scenario were negligible. The cost analysis results suggest that LTTD combined with stabilization/solidification could be more economically attractive than secure landfill for the handling of OBDCs.",nocancer

"Microcalcification is one of the significant indications for or can even be the sole mammographic feature of breast cancer, especially occult breast cancer. Biopsy and pathologic examination are the most important methods used to identify the nature of suspicious microcalcifications. Stereotactic vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (S-VAB) is the most commonly used biopsy method for microcalcifications currently because of the high detection rate of mammography for microcalcifications. However, in recent years, several clinical studies have gradually found that ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (US-VAB) could be an alternative to S-VAB for microcalcifications to some extent, and has its own advantages of flexibility, real-time performance, comfort and high accessibility compared with mammography. An overview of US-VAB of microcalcifications is provided with respect to success rate, diagnostic accuracy, advantages and limitations. On the basis of numerous studies and clinical experience, US-VAB proved to be a valid alternative to S-VAB, with comparable diagnostic accuracy if the microcalcification foci could be detected by ultrasound. And for patients with ultrasound-invisible microcalcifications who are not suitable for or tolerable of S-VAB, US-VAB combined with mammography localization of microcalcifications can also be considered.",nocancer

"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This article reviews current epidemiologic trends, clinical presentations, and diagnostic strategies for central nervous system (CNS) infections in human immunodeficiency virus-negative (HIV) patients immunocompromised by their underlying disease or by receipt of immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies. Three patient groups are considered: (1) cancer patients; (2) hematopoietic or solid organ transplantation recipients; and (3) patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions requiring therapies that alter the host immune response. RECENT FINDINGS: Clinical presentations, associated neuroimaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormalities differ between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. Infections can trigger the emergence of neurotropic antibodies or inflammatory conditions due to treatment with cancer immunotherapies. Unbiased metagenomic assays to identify obscure pathogens help clinicians navigate the increasing range of conditions affecting the growing population of patients with altered immunity. Awareness of clinical presentations and disease and drug-specific risks is important for early diagnosis and intervention in these often life-threatening infections and their noninfectious mimes.",nocancer
"The epidemic of obesity is a major challenge for health policymakers due to its far-reaching effects on population health and potentially overwhelming financial burden on healthcare systems. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of developing acute and chronic diseases, including hypertension, stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Interestingly, the metabolic dysregulation associated with obesity is similar to that observed in normal aging, and substantial evidence suggests the potential of obesity to accelerate aging. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of fat tissue dysfunction in obesity could provide insights into the processes that contribute to the metabolic dysfunction associated with the aging process. Here, we review the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying both obesity and aging, and how obesity and aging can predispose individuals to chronic health complications. The potential of lifestyle and pharmacological interventions to counter obesity and obesity-related pathologies, as well as aging, is also addressed.",nocancer
"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a key lipid mediator in health and disease, and serves as a crucial link between the immune response and cancer. With the advent of cancer therapies targeting PGE2 signaling pathways at different levels, there has been increased interest in mapping and understanding the complex and interconnected signaling pathways arising from the four distinct PGE2 receptors. Here, we review phosphoproteomics studies that have investigated different aspects of PGE2 signaling in T cells. These studies have elucidated PGE2's regulatory effect on T Cell Receptor signaling and T cell function, the key role of protein kinase A in many PGE2 signaling pathways, the temporal regulation of PGE2 signaling, differences in PGE2 signaling between different T cell subtypes and finally, the crosstalk between PGE2 signaling pathways elicited by the four distinct PGE2 receptors present in T cells. Significance Statement Through the reviewed studies, we now have a much better understanding of PGE2's signaling mechanisms and functional roles in T cells, as well as a solid platform for targeted and functional studies of specific PGE2-triggered pathways in T cells.",nocancer
"Poor diet quality is a leading risk factor for death in the United States (U.S.). We examined the association between Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) scores and death from all-causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia not otherwise specified (NOS) among postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (1993-2017). This analysis included 59,388 participants who completed a food frequency questionnaire and were free of cancer, CVD and diabetes at enrollment. Stratified Cox proportional hazards models were fit using person-years from enrollment as the underlying time metric. We estimated multivariable adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for risk of death associated with HEI-2015 quintiles, with higher scores reflecting more optimal diet quality. Over a median of 18.2 years, 9,679 total deaths 3,303 cancer deaths, 2,362 CVD deaths, and 488 deaths from Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia NOS occurred. Compared to those with lower scores, women with higher HEI-2015 scores had an 18% lower risk of all-cause mortality and 21% lower risk of cancer mortality. HEI-2015 scores were not associated with mortality from CVD, Alzheimer's Disease and dementia NOS. Consuming a diet aligned with 2015-2020 U.S. Dietary Guidelines may have beneficial impacts for preventing death from cancer and overall.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To compare lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic according to the presence or absence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in Brazilian adults. METHODS: Cross-sectional study, using data from the ConVid survey, between April and May 2020. The following variables were evaluated: lifestyle and presence of one or more NCDs (diabetes, hypertension, respiratory disease, heart disease, and cancer). Sociodemographic characteristics were used as adjustment. Relative frequencies and confidence intervals (CI) of 95% of the explanatory variables were calculated before and during the pandemic. For the comparison of groups, with or without NCDs, crude and adjusted (PRadj) prevalence ratios were estimated by Poisson regression. RESULTS: There was a reduction in physical activity (60% in those without NCDs and 58% in those with NCDs) and in vegetable consumption (10.8% in those without NCDs and 12.7% in those with NCDs). On the other hand, there was an increase in the time spent watching television and on screens of computer/tablet (302% and 43.5% in those without NCDs and 196.5% and 30.6% with NCDs, respectively); consumption of frozen meals (43.6% in those without NCDs and 53.7% with NCDs), snacks (42.3% without NCDs and 31.2% with NCDs), and chocolate (14.8% without NCDs). During the pandemic, patients with NCDs were less active (PRadj = 0.77; 95%CI 0.65 - 0.92), had greater habit of watching TV (PRadj = 1.16; 95%CI 1.08 - 1.26), and consumed less vegetables (PRadj = 0.88; 95%CI 0.81 - 0.96). CONCLUSION: It was evident that adults with NCDs had their lifestyles more altered during the COVID-19 pandemic.",nocancer
"Psoriasis is an inflammatory immune-mediated skin disease that affects both adults and children. Increased understanding of its pathogenesis has led to the development of highly effective therapeutic solutions in the form of biological drugs for adult patients with severe forms of the disease. The unpredictability of the action of adult-approved drugs in pediatric populations limited their usage in these patients for several years. However, this scenario has been changing, particularly in the last decade, increasing our knowledge of the clinical efficacy and safety of these drugs in pediatric populations. The approval/extensions to approvals of several biological agents throughout the year 2020 makes it important to update the topic. Five biological agents (etanercept, adalimumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, and ixekizumab) have been approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of psoriasis in pediatric populations, and three of them (etanercept, ustekinumab, and ixekizumab) were also approved by the US FDA for the same purpose. In total, 17 clinical trials of several distinct targeted therapies (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin [IL]-17 and IL-23, and phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors) are ongoing in pediatric patients and will certainly provide crucial data on the subject, which could ultimately improve the armamentarium we have to target psoriasis in this special population.",nocancer
"Traumatic injuries, tumor resections, and degenerative diseases can damage skeletal muscle and lead to functional impairment and severe disability. Skeletal muscle regeneration is a complex process that depends on various cell types, signaling molecules, architectural cues, and physicochemical properties to be successful. To promote muscle repair and regeneration, various strategies for skeletal muscle tissue engineering have been developed in the last decades. However, there is still a high demand for the development of new methods and materials that promote skeletal muscle repair and functional regeneration to bring approaches closer to therapies in the clinic that structurally and functionally repair muscle. The combination of stem cells, biomaterials, and biomolecules is used to induce skeletal muscle regeneration. In this review, we provide an overview of different cell types used to treat skeletal muscle injury, highlight current strategies in biomaterial-based approaches, the importance of topography for the successful creation of functional striated muscle fibers, and discuss novel methods for muscle regeneration and challenges for their future clinical implementation.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Identification of the predictors of readmission can facilitate appropriate perioperative management. The current study aimed to investigate the potential predictors of unexpected readmission after lung resection for primary lung cancers. METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 1000 patients who underwent pulmonary resection for lung cancer at our institution between January 2016 and December 2017. Unexpected readmission was defined as unscheduled readmission to our hospital within 30 days after discharge. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for identification of perioperative factors associated with readmission. RESULTS: Forty-three patients (4.3%) required unexpected readmission, and the median interval between the day of discharge and readmission was 10 days (range 1-29 days). The reasons for readmission included empyema and pleural effusion (n = 11), acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 7), pneumothorax (n = 7), and others (n = 18). The median hospitalization length after readmission was 14 days (range 2-90 days). Four patients (9.3%) died in the hospital because of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis after readmission. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, postoperative refractory air leakage, defined as prolonged air leakage lasting > 5 days or requiring reoperation, was identified as a significant predictor associated with an increased risk of readmission (odds ratio 2.87; 95% confidence interval 1.22-6.72; p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Unexpected readmission was an inevitable event following lung resection. Patients with readmission had an increased risk of death. Refractory air leakage after lung resection for primary lung cancer was strongly associated with unexpected readmission.",nocancer
"Medical image segmentation is a typical task in medical image processing and critical foundation in medical image analysis. U-Net is well-liked in medical image segmentation, but it doesn't fully explore useful features of the channel and capitalize on the contextual information. Therefore, we present an improved U-Net with residual connections, adding a plug-and-play, very portable channel attention (CA) block and a hybrid dilated attention convolutional (HDAC) layer to perform medical image segmentation for different tasks accurately and effectively, and call it HDA-ResUNet, in which we fully utilize advantages of U-Net, attention mechanism and dilated convolution. In contrast to the simple copy splicing of U-Net in the skip connection, the channel attention block is inserted into the extracted feature map of the encoding path before decoding operation. Since this block is lightweight, we can apply it to multiple layers in the backbone network to optimize the channel effect of this layer's coding operation. In addition, the convolutional layer at the bottom of the ""U""-shaped network is replaced by a hybrid dilated attention convolutional (HDAC) layer to fuse information from different sizes of receptive fields. The proposed HDA-ResUNet is evaluated on four datasets: liver and tumor segmentation (LiTS 2017), lung segmentation (Lung dataset), nuclear segmentation in microscope images (DSB 2018) and neuron structure segmentation (ISBI 2012). The dice global scores of liver and tumor segmentation (LiTS 2017) reach 0.949 and 0.799. The dice coefficients of lung segmentation and nuclear segmentation are 0.9797 and 0.9081 respectively, and the information theoretic score for the last one is 0.9703. The segmentation results are all more accurate than U-Net with fewer parameters, and the problem of slow convergence speed of U-Net on DBS 2018 is solved.",nocancer
"Background/Aims: A better understanding of cancer cell biology has led to the discovery and development of several new targeted agents for cancer. These drugs are widely used in cancer treatment and have good toxicity profiles. However, some patients are extremely sensitive to these drugs and can develop severe toxicities. Among the toxicities, pulmonary complications are infrequent with most targeted therapies. This study aimed to identify the radiologic pulmonary complications in various targeted therapies and to analyze the characteristics of patients with pulmonary toxicity. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and chest image findings of 644 patients who were treated with targeted antineoplastic agents at Soonchunhyang University Hospital between May 2005 and September 2014. Results: Of these 644 patients, 90 (14.0%) developed pulmonary complications as noted on chest computed tomography. Among these patients, 15 (2.3%) developed drug-related pulmonary toxicities. Treatment with targeted agents was discontinued in all patients, while 11 patients were simultaneously treated with glucocorticoids. Three patients died of drug-related pulmonary toxicity. Conclusions: During targeted therapy, clinicians should assess for pulmonary toxicities and symptoms that occur with dyspnea. If drug-induced pulmonary toxicities are suspected, imaging studies should be performed immediately, and the possibility of variable radiological patterns should be considered. Discontinuing the use of implicated causative agents and treatment with glucocorticoids resulted in an improvement in both symptoms and imaging findings, but some patients still experienced fatal pulmonary toxicities.",nocancer
"The development of precision medicine in oncology to define profiles of patients who could benefit from specific and relevant anti-cancer therapies is essential. An increasing number of specific eligibility criteria are necessary to be eligible to targeted therapies. This study aimed to develop an automated algorithm based on natural language processing to detect patients and tumor characteristics to reduce the time-consuming prescreening for trial inclusions. Hence, 640 anonymized multidisciplinary team meeting (MTM) reports concerning lung cancer were extracted from one teaching hospital data warehouse in France and annotated. To automate the extraction of 52 bioclinical information corresponding to 8 major eligibility criteria, regular expressions were implemented and evaluated. The performance parameters were satisfying: macroaverage F1-score 93%; rates reached 98% for precision and 92% for recall. In MTM, fill rates variabilities among patients and tumors information remained important (from 31.4% to 100%). The least reported characteristics and the most difficult to automatically collect were genetic mutations and rearrangement test results.",nocancer
"Owing to their ability to rapidly proliferate in specific niches and their amenability to genetic manipulation, bacteria are frequently studied as potential diagnostic or therapeutic bioagents in a range of pathological contexts. A sustained oxygen supply within solid tumors is essential in order to achieve positive radiotherapy (RT) outcomes, as these intratumoral oxygen levels are necessary to facilitate RT-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In this study, a genetically engineered variant of the tumor-targeting probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 bacteria that secret catalase is utilized to alleviate intratumoral hypoxia and to thereby enhance tumor radiosensitivity. These engineered bacteria are able to facilitate robust O2 evolution and consequent ROS generation in response to X-ray irradiation both in vitro and in vivo, significantly inhibiting tumor growth. Overall, the study highlights a novel and practical approach to enhance the efficacy of tumor RT, underscoring the value of future research in the field of probiotic medicine.",nocancer
"Sweet cherries (Prunus avium L.) are among the most appreciated fruits worldwide because of their organoleptic properties and nutritional value. The accurate phytochemical composition and nutritional value of sweet cherries depends on the climatic region, cultivar, and bioaccessibility and bioavailability of specific compounds. Nevertheless, sweet cherry extracts are highly enriched in several phenolic compounds with relevant bioactivity. Over the years, technological advances in chemical analysis and fields as varied as proteomics, genomics and bioinformatics, have allowed the detailed characterization of the sweet cherry bioactive phytonutrients and their biological function. In this context, the effect of sweet cherries on suppressing important events in the carcinogenic process, such as oxidative stress and inflammation, was widely documented. Interestingly, results from our research group and others have widened the action of sweet cherries to many hallmarks of cancer, namely metabolic reprogramming. The present review discusses the anticarcinogenic potential of sweet cherries by addressing their phytochemical composition, the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of specific bioactive compounds, and the existing knowledge concerning the effects against oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, deregulated cell proliferation and apoptosis, invasion and metastization, and metabolic alterations. Globally, this review highlights the prospective use of sweet cherries as a dietary supplement or in cancer treatment.",nocancer
"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a prime focus for clinicians to maintain the homeostatic function in health and deliver the theranostics in brain cancer and number of neurological diseases. The structural hierarchy and in situ biochemical signaling of BBB neurovascular unit have been primary targets to recapitulate into the in vitro modules. The microengineered perfusion systems and development in 3D cellular and organoid culture have given a major thrust to BBB research for neuropharmacology. In this review, we focus on revisiting the nanoparticles based bimolecular engineering to enable them to maneuver, control, target, and deliver the theranostic payloads across cellular BBB as nanorobots or nanobots. Subsequently we provide a brief outline of specific case studies addressing the payload delivery in brain tumor and neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, etc.). In addition, we also address the opportunities and challenges across the nanorobots' development and design. Finally, we address how computationally powered machine learning (ML) tools and artificial intelligence (AI) can be partnered with robotics to predict and design the next generation nanorobots to interact and deliver across the BBB without causing damage, toxicity, or malfunctions.

"Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for mammals, and its deficiency seriously threatens human health. A series of biofortification strategies have been developed to produce Se-enriched foods for combating Se deficiency. Although there have been some inconsistent results, extensive evidence has suggested that Se supplementation is beneficial for preventing and treating several chronic diseases. Understanding the association between Se and chronic diseases is essential for guiding clinical practice, developing effective public health policies, and ultimately counteracting health issues associated with Se deficiency. The current review will discuss the food sources of Se, biofortification strategies, metabolism and biological activities, clinical disorders and dietary reference intakes, as well as the relationship between Se and health outcomes, especially cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic inflammation, cancer, and fertility. Additionally, some concepts were proposed, there is a non-linear U-shaped dose-responsive relationship between Se status and health effects: subjects with a low baseline Se status can benefit from Se supplementation, while Se supplementation in populations with an adequate or high status may potentially increase the risk of some diseases. In addition, at supra-nutritional levels, methylated Se compounds exerted more promising cancer chemo-preventive efficacy in preclinical trials.",nocancer
"Cancer metabolism adapts the metabolic network of its tissue of origin. However, breast cancer is not a disease of a single origin. Multiple epithelial populations serve as the culprit cell of origin for specific breast cancer subtypes, yet our knowledge of the metabolic network of normal mammary epithelial cells is limited. Using a multi-omic approach, here we identify the diverse metabolic programmes operating in normal mammary populations. The proteomes of basal, luminal progenitor and mature luminal cell populations revealed enrichment of glycolysis in basal cells and of oxidative phosphorylation in luminal progenitors. Single-cell transcriptomes corroborated lineage-specific metabolic identities and additional intra-lineage heterogeneity. Mitochondrial form and function differed across lineages, with clonogenicity correlating with mitochondrial activity. Targeting oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis with inhibitors exposed lineage-rooted metabolic vulnerabilities of mammary progenitors. Bioinformatics indicated breast cancer subtypes retain metabolic features of their putative cell of origin. Thus, lineage-rooted metabolic identities of normal mammary cells may underlie breast cancer metabolic heterogeneity and targeting these vulnerabilities could advance breast cancer therapy.",nocancer
"Magonia pubescens A. St.-Hil. is a brazilian species that presents ethnopharmacological uses as wound and pain healing and seborrhea treatment. For the first time, essential oils (EOs) obtained from M. pubescens inflorescences were studied.

The cytotoxic activity of the EOs was evaluated against K562 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cell lines. A total of 30 components were identified, being 24 compounds detected for the first time in M. pubescens . The main obtained components were hotrienol (35.9%), cis -linalool oxide (17.0%) and trans -linalool oxide (10.2%). The chemical composition of the EO was slightly affected by the applied radiation doses. Irradiated and non-irradiated EOs showed cytotoxic activity against both cell lines and the non-irradiated EO sample was the most active against the K562 cell line (IC 50 = 22.10+-1.98).",nocancer
"The microbiome is a term that usually refers to the community of various microorganisms that inhabit/live inside human/animal bodies or on their skin. It forms a complex ecosystem that includes trillions of commensals, symbiotics, and even pathogenic microorganisms. The external environment, diet, and lifestyle are the major determinants influencing the microbiome's composition and vitality. Recent studies have indicated the tremendous influence of the microbiome on health and disease. Their number, constitution, variation, and viability are dynamic. All these elements are responsible for the induction, development, and treatment of many health disorders. Serious diseases such as cancer, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and even psychological disorders such as schizophrenia are influenced directly or indirectly by microbiota. In addition, in the last few weeks, accumulating data about the link between COVID-19 and the microbiota were published. In the present work, the role of the microbiome in health and disease is discussed. A deep understanding of the exact role of microbiota in disease induction enables the prevention of diseases and the development of new therapeutic concepts for most diseases through the correction of diet and lifestyle.

"BACKGROUND: Meta-analyses are widely used to strengthen available evidence and obtain more precise estimates of treatment effect than any individual trial. Paradoxically, multiplication of meta-analyses on the same topic can lead to confusion as practitioners no longer benefit from a rapid and synthetic response. This phenomenon may appear disproportionate when the number of published meta-analyses exceeds the number of original studies. OBJECTIVES: To describe an example of redundant meta-analyses published in the same area with the same randomized clinical trials (RCTs). METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify all published meta-analyses of original RCTs that compared DOACs to LMWHs in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE). Forest plots were used to represent the meta-analyses results for efficacy (VTE recurrence) and safety (major bleeding) endpoints. An authors' network was constructed to explore the links between the authors of the published meta-analyses. RESULTS: In the past 3 years, four original RCTs were the subject of 20 published meta-analyses by 142 authors: 5, 4 and 11 meta-analyses pooled the data of 2, 3 and 4 RCTs, respectively. The results of meta-analyses were similar regarding the risks of VTE recurrence and major bleeding. The 11 meta-analyses of 4 RCTs were published within 6 months of the publication of the last RCT. CONCLUSIONS: The epidemic proportions of such redundant literature and authorship could be moderated by developing 'living' meta-analyses and encouraging authors of new RCTs to update the corresponding meta-analysis in the same paper as their original research.",nocancer
"PM2.5 in Shijiazhuang was collected from October 15, 2018 to January 31, 2019, and selected toxic elements were measured. Five typical haze episodes were chosen to analyze the health risks and critical risk sources. Toxic elements during the haze episodes accounted for 0.33% of PM2.5 mass. Non-cancer risk of toxic elements for children was 1.8 times higher than that for adults during the haze episodes, while cancer risk for adults was 2.5 times higher than that for children; cancer and non-cancer risks were primarily attributable to As and Mn, respectively. Health risks of toxic elements increased during the growth and stable periods of haze episodes. Non-cancer and cancer risks of toxic elements during the haze stable periods were higher than other haze stages, and higher for children than for adults during the stable period. Mn was the largest contributor to non-cancer risk during different haze stages, while As was the largest contributor to cancer risk. Crustal dust, vehicle emissions, and industrial emissions were critical sources of cancer risk during the clean-air periods; while vehicle emissions, coal combustion, and crustal dust were key sources of cancer risk during the haze episodes. Cancer risks of crustal dust and vehicle emissions during the haze episodes were 2.0 and 1.7 times higher than those in the clean-air periods. Non-cancer risks from emission sources were not found during different periods. Cancer risks of biomass burning and coal combustion increased rapidly during the haze growth period, while that of coal combustion decreased sharply during the dissipation period. Vehicle emissions, crustal dust, and coal combustion were significant cancer risk sources during different haze stages, cancer risk of each source was the highest during the stable period. Southern Hebei, Northern and central Shaanxi were potential risk regions that affected the health of both adults and children in Shijiazhuang.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic may have modified dispensing of colonoscopy preparations, a proxy for the number of colonoscopies performed. We therefore studied changes in dispensing of colonoscopy preparations during the pandemic in France. METHODS: Using the French national health data system, we identified colonoscopy preparations dispensed from 2018 to 2020. The expected 2020 dispensations were estimated from 2018 to 2019 dispensations. RESULTS: Dispensing of colonoscopy preparations decreased markedly during the eight weeks of national lockdown: 83,045 colonoscopy preparations were dispensed, i.e., 181,826 (68.6%) fewer than expected. After lockdown, dispensing of colonoscopy preparations gradually returned to expected numbers. Overall, this represents an estimated decrease of roughly 250,000 colonoscopy preparations during the six-month period following onset of the pandemic. This shortfall in the dispensing of colonoscopy preparations was of the same order of magnitude in people under or over 50 years of age, in men and women, and in those in the highest and the lowest quintiles of the deprivation index. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, roughly 250,000 fewer colonoscopy preparations were dispensed during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. Deleterious consequences on morbidity and mortality related to gastroenterological diseases, such as colorectal cancer, are to be feared.",nocancer
"Glutamine is essential for maintaining the TCA cycle in cancer cells yet they undergo glutamine starvation in the core of tumors. Cancer stem cells (CSCs), responsible for tumor recurrence are often found in the nutrient limiting cores. Our study uncovers the molecular basis and cellular links between glutamine deprivation and stemness in the cancer cells. We showed that glutamine is dispensable for the survival of ovarian and colon cancer cells while it is required for their proliferation. Glutamine starvation leads to the metabolic reprogramming in tumor cells with enhanced glycolysis and unaltered oxidative phosphorylation. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in glutamine limiting condition induces MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling pathway to phosphorylate dynamin-related protein-1(DRP1) at Ser616. Moreover, p-DRP1 promotes mitochondrial fragmentation and enhances numbers of CD44 and CD117/CD45 positive CSCs. Besides the established features of cancer stem cells, glutamine deprivation induces perinuclear localization of fragmented mitochondria and reduction in proliferation rate which are usually observed in CSCs. Treatment with glutaminase inhibitor (L-DON) mimics the effects of glutamine starvation without altering cell survival in in vitro as well as in in vivo model. Interestingly, the combinatorial treatment of L-DON with DRP1 inhibitor (MDiVi-1) reduces the stem cell population in tumor tissue in mouse model. Collectively our data suggest that glutamine deficiency in the core of tumors can increase the cancer stem cell population and the combination therapy with MDiVi-1 and L-DON is a useful approach to reduce CSCs population in tumor.",nocancer
"Head and neck defect reconstruction is a common challenge for plastic surgeons. Microsurgical free tissue transfer is a frequently used solution but its success strictly depends on the quality of recipient vessels. A particularly demanding situation occurs when there are no nearby available vessels because of previous extensive neck dissection and radiotherapy. In similar cases, it is necessary to resort to other and farther vessels. Common alternatives might be the thoraco-acromial vessels, the transverse cervical vessels, and the internal mammary vessel. Recently, the perforator vessels of the internal mammary artery and vein were shown to be safe alternatives as recipient vessels for autologous breast reconstruction, causing less morbidity and allowing adequate perfusion of rather large flaps. Here we present a floor of the mouth reconstruction after cancer relapse resection. In this case, we employed a chimeric anterolateral thigh (ALT) free flap anastomosed to the internal mammary perforator vessels in end-to-end fashion. A 46-years-old male patient presented a defect in the floor of the mouth and base of the tongue after cancer removal. No nearby vessels were available because of extensive fibrosis and damages due to previous surgeries and radiotherapy. Therefore, on the basis of our experience in autologous breast reconstruction, we chose the internal mammary perforator vessels in the recipient side and we harvested a chimeric ALT-based skin island then split into two parts for mouth reconstruction and monitoring. We performed the anastomosis resorting to internal mammary perforator vessels and we obtained a satisfactory result from both the functional and aesthetic point of view. Postoperative course was uneventful and at 6 months follow up the reconstructive result was good with no functional issue. We believe that this might be a valid and modern evolution of the use of internal mammary vessels as recipient vessels and that it is a worthy addition in the field of perforator-anastomosed flaps, extending its application also to head and neck reconstructions. Moreover, a brief literature review about alternative recipient vessels for depleted neck is also provided.",nocancer

"Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are indicated to treat ankylosing spondylitis (AS), also termed radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA). The main indication for TNFi is symptom relief, and whether they retard spinal structural damage as assessed by radiography is debated. Hips are the most common ""non-spinal"" joints involved in AS patients leading to major incapacitation. No major treatment guidelines mention measures to prevent peripheral joint damage, especially hips, in individuals with AS. We present our experience of prevention of structural damage in hips by TNFi in 4 AS patients from our practice. We conducted a literature review looking for articles describing prevention of structural damage progression in hips by TNFi. Over a 10-year period, three out of four patients were treated with TNFi and had no progression in hip damage as assessed by imaging. Only one patient that withdrew the TNFi due to infectious complications developed rapid worsening and required hip arthroplasty. Our literature review showed multiple case series with similar results suggesting that use of TNFi in patients with AS may prevent structural damage and at least postpone a hip replacement at a young age. Based on our experience, as well as from the literature review, we believe that treatment guidelines in axSpA should recommend prompt institution of TNFi following identification of hip involvement in patients to prevent a major source of disability. Whether interleukin (IL)-17 inhibitors or targeted synthetic anti-rheumatic drugs have hip sparing effects in patients with AS should also be investigated. Key Points   Hip involvement in ankylosing spondylitis is a major source of disability.   TNFi prevent hip damage in ankylosing spondylitis.   Prompt institution of TNFi should follow suspicion of hip involvement in ankylosing spondylitis.",nocancer
"Dysregulated mTORC1 signaling alters a wide range of cellular processes, contributing to metabolic disorders and cancer. Defining the molecular details of downstream effectors is thus critical for uncovering selective therapeutic targets. We report that mTORC1 and its downstream kinase S6K enhance eIF4A/4B-mediated translation of Wilms' tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), an adaptor for the N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methyltransferase complex. This regulation is mediated by 5' UTR of WTAP mRNA that is targeted by eIF4A/4B. Single-nucleotide-resolution m6A mapping revealed that MAX dimerization protein 2 (MXD2) mRNA contains m6A, and increased m6A modification enhances its degradation. WTAP induces cMyc-MAX association by suppressing MXD2 expression, which promotes cMyc transcriptional activity and proliferation of mTORC1-activated cancer cells. These results elucidate a mechanism whereby mTORC1 stimulates oncogenic signaling via m6A RNA modification and illuminates the WTAP-MXD2-cMyc axis as a potential therapeutic target for mTORC1-driven cancers.",nocancer
"A human health risk assessment was performed to evaluate if a biofilter for the biological methane oxidation reduces the risk from exposure to landfill gas emissions and improves the air quality mitigating odour emissions from an aftercare landfill. Accordingly, three different scenarios of landfill gas management were defined, 9 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (cyclohexane, n-hexane, 2-methylpentane, 3-methylpentane, benzene, xylenes, toluene, dichlorodifluoromethane, vinyl chloride) were identified and using the CALPUFF dispersion model; the pollutant concentration at eleven sensitive receptors was determined. Consequently, the risk (for cancer and non-cancer compounds) was assessed applying the methodology proposed by USEPA 2009. From one hand, to determine concentration and emission rates of VOCs and hydrogen sulphide, a sample of raw landfill gas and three air samples from the biofilter surface were collected with dynamic flux chamber method and analysed in accordance with US EPA, 1986 and USEPA TO-15, 1999. To the other hand, odour emissions were assessed based both on chemical and dynamic olfactometric measurements (EN 13725:2003). The field surveys results showed a reduction of the cancer risk on average by 79% and of the hazard quotient on average by 92%. In contrast, the results of olfactometry measurements showed a lower efficiency on odour reduction than the target value of 70%. Nonetheless, the odour concentration was always far below 300 uoE m-3 at the biofilter surface and odour concentration never exceed 1 uoE m-3 at the sensitive receptors.",nocancer

"INTRODUCTION: Combinations of unhealthy lifestyle factors are strongly associated with mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer. It is unclear how socioeconomic status (SES) affects those associations. Lower SES groups may be disproportionately vulnerable to the effects of unhealthy lifestyle factors compared with higher SES groups via interactions with other factors associated with low SES (eg, stress) or via accelerated biological ageing. This systematic review aims to synthesise studies that examine how SES moderates the association between lifestyle factor combinations and adverse health outcomes. Greater understanding of how lifestyle risk varies across socioeconomic spectra could reduce adverse health by (1) identifying novel high-risk groups or targets for future interventions and (2) informing research, policy and interventions that aim to support healthy lifestyles in socioeconomically deprived communities. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Three databases will be searched (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL) from inception to March 2020. Reference lists, citations and grey literature will also be searched. Inclusion criteria are: (1) prospective cohort studies; (2) investigations of two key exposures: (a) lifestyle factor combinations of at least three lifestyle factors (eg, smoking, physical activity and diet) and (b) SES (eg, income, education or poverty index); (3) an assessment of the impact of SES on the association between combinations of unhealthy lifestyle factors and health outcomes; (4) at least one outcome from-mortality (all cause, CVD and cancer), CVD or cancer incidence. Two independent reviewers will screen titles, abstracts and full texts of included studies. Data extraction will focus on cohort characteristics, exposures, direction and magnitude of SES effects, methods and quality (via Newcastle-Ottawa Scale). If appropriate, a meta-analysis, pooling the effects of SES, will be performed. Alternatively, a synthesis without meta-analysis will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publication, professional networks, social media and conference presentations.

"As an attractive tumor-associated antigen (TAA), Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) is usually overexpressed in malignant hematological diseases. In recent years, WT1-specific adoptive immunotherapy has been the ""hot spot"" for tumor treatment. The main immunotherapeutic techniques associated with WT1 include WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), vaccine, and T cell receptor (TCR) gene therapy. WT1-based adoptive immunotherapy exhibited promising anti-tumorous effect with tolerable safety. There are still many limitations needed to be improved including the weak immunogenetics of WT1, immune tolerance, and short persistence of the immune response. In this review, we summarized the progress of productive technologies and the clinical or preclinical investigations of WT1-specific immunotherapy in hematological diseases.",nocancer
"OTU domain-containing ubiquitin aldehyde-binding proteins Otubain1 (OTUB1) and Otubain2 (OTUB2) were initially identified as OTU deubiquitinases (DUBs). Recently, Otubains have emerged as essential regulators of diverse physiological processes, such as immune signaling and DNA damage response. Dysregulation of those processes likely to increase the risk in multiple aspects of aging-related diseases, including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, chronic kidney diseases, bone dysplasia and pulmonary fibrosis. Consistently, Otubains are aberrantly expressed in cancers and have been identified to be both tumor suppressors and tumor promoters in different types of cancers. Therefore, the regulatory mechanism of the activity and expression of Otubains is very important for better understanding of Otubains-associated biological networks and human diseases. This review provides a comprehensive description of functions and regulatory axis of Otubains, highlighting experimental evidences indicating Otubains as potential therapeutic targets against aging-related disorders.",nocancer
"Peptide/protein therapeutics have been significantly applied in the clinical treatment of various diseases such as cancer, diabetes, etc. owing to their high biocompatibility, specificity, and therapeutic efficacy. However, due to their immunogenicity, instability stemming from its complex tertiary and quaternary structure, vulnerability to enzyme degradation, and rapid renal clearance, the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics is significantly confined. Though nanotechnology has been demonstrated to prevent enzyme degradation of the protein therapeutics and thus enhance the half-life, issues such as initial burst release and uncontrollable release kinetics are still unsolved. Moreover, the traditional administration method results in poor patient compliance, limiting the clinical application of protein/peptide therapeutics. Exploiting the sustained-release formulations for more controllable delivery of protein/peptide therapeutics to decrease the frequency of injection and enhance patient compliance is thus greatly meaningful. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the substantial advancements of protein/peptide sustained-release systems in the past decades. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of all these sustained-release systems in clinical application together with their future challenges are also discussed in this review.",nocancer
"beta-Glucans are polysaccharides generally obtained from the cell wall of bacteria, fungi, yeasts, and aleurone layer of cereals. beta-Glucans are polymers, with beta-1,3 glucose as core linear structure, but they differ in their main branch length, linkages, and branching patterns, giving rise to high and low-molecular-weight beta-glucans. They are well-known cell response modifiers with immune-modulating, nutraceutical, and health beneficial effects, including anticancer and pro-apoptotic properties. beta-Glucan extracts have shown positive responses in controlling tumor cell proliferation and activation of the immune system. The immunomodulatory action of beta-glucans enhances the host's antitumor defense against cancer. In consonance with the above, many studies have shown that beta-glucan treatment leads to the induction of apoptotic death of cancer cells. The ability of beta-glucans to stimulate apoptotic pathways or, the proteins involved in apoptosis prompting a new domain in cancer therapy. beta-glucan can be a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of cancer. However, there is a need to legitimize the beta-glucan type, as most of the studies include beta-glucan from different sources having different physicochemical properties. The body of literature presented here focuses on the effects of beta-glucan on immunomodulation, proliferation, cell death, and the possible mechanisms and pathways involved in these processes.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The relationship between cancer and dementia is triggering growing research interest. Several preclinical studies have provided the biological rationale for the repurposing of specific anticancer agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a growing number of research protocols are testing their efficacy and safety/tolerability in patients with AD. METHODS: The aim of the present systematic review was to provide an overview on the repurposing of approved anticancer drugs in clinical trials for AD by considering both ongoing and completed research protocols in all phases. In parallel, a systematic literature review was conducted on PubMed, ISI Web, and the Cochrane Library to identify published clinical studies on repurposed anticancer agents in AD. RESULTS: Based on a structured search on the ClinicalTrials.gov and the EudraCT databases, we identified 13 clinical trials testing 11 different approved anticancer agents (five tyrosine kinase inhibitors, two retinoid X receptor agonists, two immunomodulatory agents, one histone deacetylase inhibitor, and one monoclonal antibody) in the AD continuum. The systematic literature search led to the identification of five published studies (one phase I, three phase II, and one phase IIb/III) reporting the effects of antitumoral treatments in patients with mild cognitive impairment or AD dementia. The clinical findings and the methodological characteristics of these studies are described and discussed. CONCLUSION: Anticancer agents are triggering growing interest in the context of repurposed therapies in AD. Several clinical trials are underway, and data are expected to be available in the near future. To date, data emerging from published clinical studies are controversial. The promising results emerging from preclinical studies and identified research protocols should be confirmed and extended by larger, adequately designed, and high-quality clinical trials.",nocancer
"A series of novel alpha-l-threose nucleoside phosphonate analogs, 4(R)-methyl-3-O-phosphonomethyl-alpha-l-threose nucleosides, were synthesized in multistep sequences starting from d-xylose. The synthetic sequence consisted of the following key stages: (i) the multistep synthesis of 1,2-O-isopropylidenyl-4(R)-methyl-3-O-phosphonomethyl-l-threose, (ii) the transformation of 1,2-O-isopropylidenyl sugar into suitable 1,2-di-O-acyl l-threose precursor, and (iii) the construction of target alpha-l-threose nucleoside phosphonate analogs by Vorbruggen glycosidation reaction, deprotection of acyl group, and hydrolysis of diethyl group on phosphonate. The target nucleoside phosphonates were evaluated for their antitumour activities in cell culture-based assays. Compound 8g, 2-fluroadenosine phosphonate, showed remarkable activity against human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) with IC50 values of 0.476 and 0.391 muM, corresponding to 41- and 47-fold higher potency than the reference compound 5-FU, respectively. Subsequent investigations found that the compound 8g can inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells and cell cloning. The mechanistic studies indicated that compound 8g could cause DNA damage to breast cancer cells through the ATM-Chk1/Chk2-cdc25c pathway, leading to blockage of the G2/M phase cycle of breast cancer cells, which ultimately led to apoptosis. Moreover, 8g could inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induce apoptosis. These results indicate that compound 8g holds promising potential as an antitumour agent.",nocancer
"Considering the lack of a comprehensive, multi-faceted overview of the ketogenic diet (KD) in relation to health issues, we compiled the evidence related to the use of the ketogenic diet in relation to its impact on the microbiome, the epigenome, diabetes, weight loss, cardiovascular health, and cancer. The KD diet could potentially increase genetic diversity of the microbiome and increase the ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes. The epigenome might be positively affected by the KD since it creates a signaling molecule known as beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB). KD has helped patients with diabetes reduce their HbA1c and reduce the need for insulin. There is evidence to suggest that a KD can help with weight loss, visceral adiposity, and appetite control. The evidence also suggests that eating a high-fat diet improves lipid profiles by lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL), increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and lowering triglycerides (TG). Due to the Warburg effect, the KD is used as an adjuvant treatment to starve cancer cells, making them more vulnerable to chemotherapy and radiation. The potential positive impacts of a KD on each of these areas warrant further analysis, improved studies, and well-designed randomized controlled trials to further illuminate the therapeutic possibilities provided by this dietary intervention.",nocancer
"Highly sensitive and reliable detection of disease-related nucleic acids is still a big challenge in liquid biopsy because of their homologous sequences and low abundance. Herein, a novel surface plasmon resonance/surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SPR/SERS) dual-mode plasmonic biosensor based on catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA)-induced Au nanoparticle (AuNP) network was proposed for highly sensitive and reliable detection of cancer-related miRNA-652. The biosensor includes capture DNA-functionalized AuNPs (Probe 1), H1 and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid (4-MBA) co-modified AuNPs (Probe 2), and 6-carboxyl-Xrhodamine (ROX)-labeled H2 (fuel strands). The Probe 1-Probe 2 networks were formed via the target-triggered CHA reactions, which resulted in the color change of dark-field microscopy (DFM) images and enhanced SERS effect. The SPR sensing was achieved by extracting the integral optical density of dark-field color in DFM images, and the SERS sensing was realized by the ratiometric SERS signals of ROX and internal standards 4-MBA molecules. After characterizing the feasibility and optimality of the sensing strategy, the good performance of biosensors on sensitivity, specificity and uniformity was approved. The practicability of biosensors was confirmed by detecting miRNA-652 in human serum, and both the SPR and SERS assays showed good linear calibration curves and low limit of detections (LODs) of 42.5 fM and 2.91 fM, respectively, with the recovery in the range of 94.67-111.4%. These two modes show complementary advantages, and the combined SPR/SERS dual-mode can provide more options for detection and double check the results to improve the accuracy and reliability of assays, which holds a great application prospect for cancer-related nucleic acids detection in early disease stage.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: The presence of caregivers or companions during clinical encounters influences the dynamics and outcomes of the encounters. Most prior studies of companions in clinical encounters focus on non-Hispanic White patients. However, there is generally lower-quality patient-physician communication during encounters with Black patients; these communication differences may contribute to racial health disparities. The purpose of the present study was to examine effects of the presence and active participation of companions on encounters between Black patients with cancer and non-Black oncologists. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data collected during a larger intervention study. Participants were Black patients with breast, colon, or lung cancer who had a treatment-discussion encounter with a participating non-Black medical oncologist. Video recordings of encounters were coded for patient, companion, and oncologist communication. After the encounter, patients reported perceptions of the recommended treatment; patients and oncologists reported perceptions of each other. RESULTS: Data from 114 patients and 19 oncologists were included in analyses. Only 47% of patients brought a companion to the encounter. Oncologists spent more time with accompanied Black patients, used more patient-centered communication with them, and perceived them as having more social support compared with unaccompanied Black patients. Oncologists reported that accompanied patients asked more questions. When companions participated more actively in the encounter, oncologists used more patient-centered communication. DISCUSSION: Bringing a companion to oncology appointments may be beneficial to Black patients because oncologists spend more time with patients, use more patient-centered communication, and perceive patients more positively, all of which may ultimately improve patient health and well-being outcomes.",nocancer

"Cellular senescence is a critical part of human anti-tumor defence; however, the accumulation of senescent cells with age underpins a wide range of pathologies. Senescent change in immune cells, or immunosenescence, has a wide range of physiological effects and is at least partially responsible for many diseases associated with aging. Immunosenescence underpins inflammaging, increased vulnerability to infectious disease with age, malignant change in the elderly, and auto-immunity. Understanding the effects and mechanisms of immunosenescence will improve disease outcomes and prevention in older adults, and generate new treatments for common illnesses. In this review we summarize the key changes occurring in immunosenescence across each facet of the immune system, and identify their clinical correlates.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: the molecular mechanism of gastric cancer development related to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection has not been fully understood, and further studies are still needed. Information regarding nanomechanical aspects of pathophysiological events that occur during H. pylori infection can be crucial in the development of new prevention, treatment, and diagnostic measures against clinical consequences associated with H. pylori infection, including gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, and gastric cancer. METHODS: in this study, we assessed mechanical properties of children's healthy and H. pylori positive stomach tissues and the mechanical response of human gastric cells exposed to heat-treated H. pylori cells using atomic force microscopy (AFM NanoWizard 4 BioScience JPK Instruments Bruker). Elastic modulus (i.e., the Young's modulus) was derived from the Hertz-Sneddon model applied to force-indentation curves. Human tissue samples were evaluated using rapid urease tests to identify H. pylori positive samples, and the presence of H. pylori cells in those samples was confirmed using immunohistopathological staining. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: collected data suggest that nanomechanical properties of infected tissue might be considered as markers indicated H. pylori presence since infected tissues are softer than uninfected ones. At the cellular level, this mechanical response is at least partially mediated by cell cytoskeleton remodeling indicating that gastric cells are able to tune their mechanical properties when subjected to the presence of H. pylori products. Persistent fluctuations of tissue mechanical properties in response to H. pylori infection might, in the long-term, promote induction of cancer development.",nocancer
"The tumor hypoxic microenvironment not only induces genetic and epigenetic changes in tumor cells, immature vessels formation for oxygen demand, but also compromises the efficiency of therapeutic interventions. On the other hand, conventional therapeutic approaches which kill tumor cells or destroy tumor blood vessels to block nutrition and oxygen supply usually facilitate even harsher microenvironment. Thus, simultaneously relieving the strained response of tumor cells and blood vessels represents a promising strategy to reverse the adverse tumor hypoxic microenvironment. In the present study, an integrated amphiphilic system (RSCD) is designed based on Angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan for siRNA delivery against the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1alpha), aiming at both vascular and cellular ""relaxation"" to reconstruct a tumor normoxic microenvironment. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have confirmed that the hypoxia-inducible HIF-1alpha expression is down-regulated by 70% and vascular growth is inhibited by 60%. The ""relaxation"" therapy enables neovascularization with more complete and organized structures to obviously increase the oxygen level inside tumor, which results in a 50% growth inhibition. Moreover, reconstruction of tumor microenvironment enhances tumor-targeted drug delivery, and significantly improves the chemotherapeutic and photodynamic anticancer treatments.",nocancer

"OBJECTIVE: Informal family caregivers play a crucial role in cancer care. Effective caregiver involvement in cancer care can improve both patient and caregiver outcomes. Despite this, interventions improving the caregiver involvement are sparse. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial evaluating the combined effectiveness of novel online caregiver communication education modules for: (1) oncology clinicians (eTRIO) and (2) patients with cancer and caregivers (eTRIO-pc). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Thirty medical/radiation/surgical oncology or haematology doctors and nurses will be randomly allocated to either intervention (eTRIO) or control (an Australian State Government Health website on caregivers) education conditions. Following completion of education, each clinician will recruit nine patient-caregiver pairs, who will be allocated to the same condition as their recruiting clinician. Eligibility includes any new adult patient diagnosed with any type/stage cancer attending consultations with a caregiver. Approximately 270 patient-caregiver pairs will be recruited. The primary outcome is caregiver self-efficacy in triadic (clinician-patient-caregiver) communication. Patient and clinician self-efficacy in triadic communication are secondary outcomes. Additional secondary outcomes for clinicians include preferences for caregiver involvement, perceived module usability/acceptability, analysis of module use, satisfaction with the module, knowledge of strategies and feedback interviews. Secondary outcomes for caregivers and patients include preferences for caregiver involvement, satisfaction with clinician communication, distress, quality of life, healthcare expenditure, perceived module usability/acceptability and analysis of module use. A subset of patients and caregivers will complete feedback interviews. Secondary outcomes for caregivers include preparedness for caregiving, patient-caregiver communication and caring experience. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, and 1 week, 12 weeks and 26 weeks post-intervention.

"Abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) not only facilitates tumor proliferation and metastasis, but also establishes physiological barriers for effective transport of therapeutics inside the tumor, posing great challenges for cancer treatment. Here we designed a core-satellite size transformable nanoframework (denoted as T-PFRT) that can synchronously adapt to and remold TME for augmenting photodynamic therapy to inhibit tumor growth and prevent tumor metastasis. Upon matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)-responsive dissociation of the nanoframework in TME, the core structure loaded with TGFbeta signaling pathway inhibitor and oxygen-carrying hemoglobin aims to stroma remodeling and hypoxia relief, allowing the photosensitizer-encapsulated satellite particles to penetrate to deep-seated tumor for oxygen-fueled photodynamic therapy. We demonstrated that T-PFRT could overcome the stroma and hypoxia barriers for delivering therapeutics, and gain excellent therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of primary and metastatic tumors.",nocancer
"Several essential components of the electron transport chain, the major producer of ATP in mammalian cells, are encoded in the mitochondrial genome. These 13 proteins are translated within mitochondria by 'mitoribosomes'. Defective mitochondrial translation underlies multiple inborn errors of metabolism and has been implicated in pathologies such as aging, metabolic syndrome and cancer. Here, we provide a detailed ribosome profiling protocol optimized to interrogate mitochondrial translation in mammalian cells (MitoRiboSeq), wherein mitoribosome footprints are generated with micrococcal nuclease and mitoribosomes are separated from cytosolic ribosomes and other RNAs by ultracentrifugation in a single straightforward step. We highlight critical steps during library preparation and provide a step-by-step guide to data analysis accompanied by open-source bioinformatic code. Our method outputs mitoribosome footprints at single-codon resolution. Codons with high footprint densities are sites of mitoribosome stalling. We recently applied this approach to demonstrate that defects in mitochondrial serine catabolism or in mitochondrial tRNA methylation cause stalling of mitoribosomes at specific codons. Our method can be applied to study basic mitochondrial biology or to characterize abnormalities in mitochondrial translation in patients with mitochondrial disorders.",nocancer

The molecular structures of 1, 2, and 4 have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The cytotoxic activity of 1-4 was evaluated using the MTS assay against human tumor cells, namely ovarian carcinoma (A2780), colorectal carcinoma (HCT116), and colorectal carcinoma resistant to doxorubicin (HCT116dox), and against normal primary fibroblasts. Whereas compounds 2 and 4 showed no cytotoxic activity toward tumor cell lines, compounds 1 and 3 were active in A2780, while showing no antiproliferative effect in human normal dermal fibroblasts at the IC50 concentrations of the A2780 cell line. Exposure of ovarian carcinoma cells to IC50 concentrations of compound 1 or 3 led to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species and an increase of apoptotic and autophagic cells. While compound 3 displayed low levels of angiogenesis induction, compound 1 showed an ability to induce cell cycle delay and to interfere with cell migration. When the in vivo toxicity studies using zebrafish and chicken embryos are considered, compounds 1 and 3, which were not lethal, are promising candidates as anticancer agents against ovarian cancer due to their good cytotoxic activity in tumor cells and their low toxicity both in vitro and in vivo.",nocancer

"Nitrones derived from natural antioxidants are emerging as highly specific therapeutics against various human diseases, including stroke, neurodegenerative pathologies, and cancer. However, the development of useful pseudo-natural nitrones requires the judicious choice of a secondary metabolite as the precursor. Betalains are nitrogen-containing natural pigments that exhibit marked antioxidant capacity and pharmacological properties and, hence, are ideal candidates for designing multifunctional nitrones. In this work, we describe the semisynthesis and properties of a biocompatible and antioxidant betalain-nitrone called OxiBeet. This bio-based compound is a better radical scavenger than ascorbic acid, gallic acid, and most non-phenolic antioxidants and undergoes concerted proton-coupled electron transfer. The autoxidation of OxiBeet produces a persistent nitroxide radical, which, herein, is studied via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy reveals that excited state formation is not required for the oxidation of OxiBeet. The results are compared with those obtained using betanin, a natural betalain, and pBeet, the imine analog of OxiBeet. The findings of this study will enable the development of antioxidant and spin-trap nitrones based on the novel N-oxide 1,7-diazaheptamethinium scaffold and betalain dyes with enhanced hydrolytic stability in aqueous alkaline media.",nocancer
"Conventional anticancer therapies exploiting platinum-based drugs rely principally on the intravascular injection of the therapeutic agent. The anticancer drug is distributed throughout the body by the systemic blood circulation undergoing cellular uptake, rapid clearance and excretion. Consequently, only a small portion of the platinum-based drug reaches the tumor site, which is associated with severe side effects. For this reason, targeted delivery systems are of great need since they offer enhanced and selective delivery of a drug to cancerous cells making the therapy safe and more effective. Up to date, a variety of the Pt-based drug targeted delivery systems (Pt-based DTDSs) utilizing nanomaterials have been developed and tested using a range of analytical techniques that provided essential information on their synthesis, stability, biodistribution and cytotoxicity. Here we summarize those experimental techniques indicating their applicability at different stages of the research, as well as pointing out their strengths, advantages, drawbacks and limitations. Also, the existing strategies and approaches are critically reviewed with the objective to reveal and give rise to the development of the analytical methodology suitable for reliable Pt-based DTDSs characterization which would eventually result in novel therapies and better patients' outcomes.",nocancer
"In this work, we describe an innovative methodology based on combined surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and electrochemical responses (eSPR) in the same immunoassay for screening CA 15-3 cancer biomarker with high sensitivity (and selectivity), in a very simple, label-free, accurate, and fully automated manner. Detection was achieved by performing two simple steps. In the first step, direct SPR was used to monitor CA 15-3 interaction with surface immobilized antibody. Two linear response ranges were obtained and the detection limit achieved is poor (LOD of 21 U mL-1). However, in the second detection step, electrochemical measurements at the SPR gold surface were performed to measure the decrease of redox probe peak current upon antigen-antibody interaction, providing a suitable amplification strategy to lower detection levels of CA 15-3 (LOD of 0.0998 U mL-1), without the need of additional complex and/or expensive amplification steps to enhance the sensitivity. Moreover, selectivity studies were performed against other common cancer biomarkers and the results showed that the eSPR immunosensor is selective for the CA 15-3 protein. Finally, the clinical applicability of the developed eSPR biosensing methodology was successfully applied to detect CA 15-3 in human serum samples at clinically relevant levels due to the high sensitivity of electrochemical readout. The same concept may be further extended to other proteins of interest.",nocancer
"Pseudoachalasia accounts for up to 4% of patients who present with achalasia-like picture and most often relates to occult malignancy at the cardia or gastroesophageal junction. Thus, any delay in diagnosis might lead to more advanced disease and less chance for curative therapy, not to mention the risk of serious complications resulting from the treatment of supposed achalasia instead of the true underlying cause. The entity should be suspected in patients with advanced age of onset, a shorter duration of symptoms, profound weight loss and difficulty in passing the gastroesophageal junction on endoscopy. The diagnosis of pseudoachalasia can be challenging as upper endoscopy with biopsy might be false negative in 25% of cases and lesions cannot always be detected on computerized tomography scan. Endoscopic ultrasound and guided biopsy play an increasingly important role in the workup of this condition. Treatment of pseudoachalasia depends on the underlying cause. The aim of this review is to highlight the clinicopathological features that distinguish pseudoachalasia from achalasia and the most appropriate diagnostic workup as well as the subsequent management for this condition.",nocancer

"CONTEXT: Relatives of patients receiving palliative care are at risk for psychological and physical distress, and their perception of quality of care can influence patients' quality of life. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to develop and validate the QUALI-PALLI-FAM questionnaire to measure families' perception of and satisfaction with palliative care. METHODS: An exploratory factor analysis was conducted, and we evaluated the questionnaire's internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha, its stability across various strata, and the correlation between the QUALI-PALLI-FAM (factors, total score, and global satisfaction) and the total score of the FAMCARE questionnaire. RESULTS: This multicentric prospective cross-sectional survey was conducted in seven French hospitals, namely, three palliative care units and four standard medical units with a mobile palliative care team. The questionnaire was completed by 170 relatives of patients (over 90% of patients had advanced cancer). The final questionnaire included 14 items across three domains: organisation of care and availability of caregivers, medical information provision, and confidence and involvement of relatives. Internal consistency was good for all subscales (Cronbach's alpha: 0.74-0.86). Our questionnaire was stable across various strata: age and gender (patients and relatives), Palliative Performance Scale scores, and care settings. The QUALI-PALLI-FAM total score was correlated with the total FAMCARE score. CONCLUSION: The QUALI-PALLI-FAM appears to be a valid, reliable, and well-accepted tool to explore relatives' perception of quality of inpatient palliative care and complements the QUALI-PALLI-PAT questionnaire.

Background: For people with cancer the offer for inpatient or outpatient oncological rehabilitation is more and more increasing. Oncological rehabilitation has an interdisciplinary approach to prepare people with cancer for their life at home. Nurses are part of the interdisciplinary team, but little is known about their special role in this setting. Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the role of nurses and their functions in cancer rehabilitation. Methods: A scoping review was conducted. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE via PubMed and CINAHL, Google Scholar and in reference lists. There was no limitation of publication period. After evaluation of the included publications a thematic analysis was undertaken. Results: All in all, 7 publications (1 qualitative study, 1 editorial book, 1 white paper, 1 article and 3 literature reviews) were included. Through thematic analysis 3 main topics were identified: nurse's role as emotional and psychological support, coach and part of the interdisciplinary team. In addition to general care, they promote self-management, advise and train, carry out symptom management and take on a coordinative function. Conclusion: This scoping review offers a first overview about the role of nurses in oncological rehabilitation. The focus is on preparation of cancer survivors for their new and changed life.",nocancer
"In the USA, an interchangeability designation provides biosimilar sponsors with a pathway for achieving what is standard for small-molecule generics: pharmacy-level auto-substitution for an innovator. No other major health authority links interchangeability to automatic substitution, as all require the involvement of the prescriber or patient in a medication change. This editorial considers the clinical impact and practicality of auto-substitution. First, interchangeability is linked to non-medical switching (NMS), the practice of switching treatment in patients with stable disease for non-clinical reasons. NMS may generate negative sentiment in those unwilling or reluctant to switch, which can adversely impact treatment outcomes (i.e., nocebo effect). Indeed, in real-world studies of tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, discontinuation rates have been shown to be higher in patients switched to biosimilars for non-medical reasons than in historical cohorts maintained on innovators. Second, interchangeability may impede pharmacovigilance and traceability, as not all jurisdictions require innovators and biosimilars to have distinct biologic names. Third, an interchangeability designation from the US Food and Drug Administration only permits a biosimilar to be automatically substituted for its innovator, not other biosimilars (if available). Pharmacist education would be needed to avoid off-label, automatic substitution among biosimilars of a single innovator. Last, once granted, an interchangeability designation exists in perpetuity under current US federal law. However, the supply chains of innovators and biosimilars are maintained independently, with no requirement for reconfirmation of biosimilarity or interchangeability. We feel that additional guidance is needed for the auto-substitution of biosimilars and innovators to become a reality.",nocancer
"Dynamic therapy, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) or chemodynamic therapy (CDT), is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for tumors. Integrating the advantages of near-infrared-induced PDT and CDT can potentially improve the therapeutic performance. A single primitive nanostructure, CuWO4 nanodots, was developed. It could generate reactive oxygen species under 808 nm light irradiation and release copper ions into the acid tumor microenvironment, thereby boosting Fenton-like reactions. The PDT and CDT would occur when the nanodots were introduced into the tumor tissue and irradiated under 808 nm light. The results of combined PDT and CDT antitumor studies showed the effective inhibition of tumor tissue growth, thereby suggesting that the nanodots are candidate agents for synergistic antitumor applications.",nocancer
"To overcome the poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability of curcumin, emphasize its functional features, and broaden its applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries, many nanoscale systems have been widely applied for its encapsulation and delivery. Over many decades, chitosan as a natural biopolymer has been extensively studied due to its polycationic nature, biodegradability, biocompatibility, non-toxicity, and non-allergenic. Various chitosan-based nanocarriers with unique properties for curcumin delivery, including but not limited to, self-assembled nanoparticles, nanocomposites, nanoemulsions, nanotubes, and nanofibers, have been designed. This review focuses on the most-recently reported fabrication techniques of different types of chitosan-based nanocarriers. The functionalities of chitosan in each formulation which determine the physicochemical properties such as surface charge, morphology, encapsulation driving force, and release profile, were discussed in detail. Moreover, the current pharmaceutical applications of curcumin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles were elaborated. The role of chitosan in facilitating the delivery of curcumin and improving the therapeutic effects on many chronic diseases, including cancer, bacterial infection, wound healing, Alzheimer's diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and hepatitis C virus, were illustrated. Particularly, the recently discovered mechanisms of action of curcumin-loaded chitosan nanoparticles against the abovementioned diseases were highlighted.",nocancer
"Brassica vegetables are widely consumed mostly after processing and cooking. These processing and cooking methods not only can affect the taste, texture, flavor and nutrients of these vegetables, but also influence the levels of some important bioactive compounds, such as glucosinolates (GLSs). Glucoraphanin (GLR) is the most abundant GLSs and its hydrolyzed component, sulforaphane (SLR), is the most powerful anti-cancer compound in brassica vegetables. In this review, we find out that varied treatments impact the retention of GLR and the formation of SLR differently. Be specific, 1) freezing can avoid the losses of GLR while short-time microwaving, short-time steaming and fermentation promote the biotransformation from GLR to SLR; 2) Boiling and blanching cause the largest losses of GLR and SLR, while freezing significantly protect their losses.; 3) Stir-frying varies the levels of GLR and SLR in different cooking conditions.",nocancer
"One important type of clinically significant lung disease that is frequently encountered by pharmacists working in consultant roles is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Data recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests that about 6% of people from the United States aged 40 years or older report a COPD diagnosis, and a major illness affecting more than 1 in 20 of the nation's population is unequivocally an important public health priority. Moreover, in the same report, high rates of comorbidities such as dyslipidaemia, hypertension, heart disease, and cancer are noted, along with increasing emergency department presentations and increasing expenditure on drug therapy used for COPD management.",nocancer
"A CD9-binding peptide (RSHRLRLH), screened from EWI-2, was characterized, and its effect on cellular migration and invasion was evaluated. As CD9 protein is overexpressed in cancer cells and plays an important role in cellular migration, the CD9-binding peptide preferentially inhibited the migration of cancer cells. Unlike conventional antiproliferative drugs, this CD9-binding peptide is promising as a novel precision antimigratory agent for cancer therapeutics.",nocancer
"The liver is the only visceral organ in the body with a tremendous capacity to regenerate in response to insults that induce inflammation, cell death, and injury. Liver regeneration is a complicated process involving a well-orchestrated activation of non-parenchymal cells in the injured area and proliferation of undamaged hepatocytes. Furthermore, the liver has a Hepatostat, defined as adjustment of its volume to that required for homeostasis. Understanding the mechanisms that control different steps of liver regeneration is critical to informing therapies for liver repair, to help patients with liver disease. The Hippo signaling pathway is well known for playing an essential role in the control and regulation of liver size, regeneration, stem cell self-renewal, and liver cancer. Thus, the Hippo pathway regulates dynamic cell fates in liver, and in absence of its downstream effectors YAP and TAZ, liver regeneration is severely impaired, and the proliferative expansion of liver cells blocked. We will mainly review upstream mechanisms activating the Hippo signaling pathway following partial hepatectomy in mouse model and patients, its roles during different steps of liver regeneration, metabolism, and cancer. We will also discuss how targeting the Hippo signaling cascade might improve liver regeneration and suppress liver tumorigenesis.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: In view of the potential gravity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for patients with cancer, epidemiological data are vital to assess virus circulation among patients and staff of cancer centres. We performed a prospective study to investigate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among staff and patients with cancer at a large cancer centre, at the end of the period of first national lockdown in France and to determine factors associated with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: After the first lockdown, all medical and non-medical staff, as well as all patients attending the medical oncology department were invited to undergo serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 between 11 May and 30 June 2020. All participants were also invited to complete a questionnaire collecting data about their living and working conditions, and for patients, medical management during lockdown. FINDINGS: A total of 1,674 subjects (663 staff members, 1011 patients) were included. Seroprevalence was low in both staff (1.8%) and patients (1.7%), despite more features of high risk for severe forms among patients. None of the risk factors tested in our analysis (working or living conditions, comorbidities, management characteristics during lockdown) was found to be statistically associated with seroprevalence in either staff or patients. There was no significant difference in the proportion of symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects between staff and patients. Only fever, loss of smell, and loss of taste were significantly more frequent among seropositive patients, in both staff and patients. INTERPRETATION: We report very low seroprevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in the staff (caregiving and non-caregiving) and patients of a large cancer care centre in which strict hygiene, personal protection, and social distancing measures were implemented.",nocancer
"This study evaluates the effects of phyto-derived zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) on human cancer cells, colon carcinoma HCT 116, and chronic myelogenous leukemic K562, along with normal lymphocytes/erythrocytes. The commercial, chemically synthesized ZnONPs (cZnONPs) were also assessed in parallel. Using an eco-friendly approach devoid of harmful chemicals, biogenic nanoparticles were synthesized from aqueous leaf extract of Spondias pinnata (SpLZnONPs) by a sol-gel method. Optical, structural, and elemental characterization of both particle types were carried out deploying UV-Vis/photoluminescence spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, FESEM, HRTEM, and EDX. Both SpLZnONPs and cZnONPs displayed hexagonal wurtzite structure with particle sizes averaging 30 and 48.5 nm, respectively. SpLZnONPs were found to be cytotoxic to both cancer cell types while cZnONPs exhibited toxicity only against HCT 116 cells. Interestingly, the cytomorphological changes and analysis of DNA laddering pattern observed in these treated cells were indicative of simultaneous induction of dual modes of death involving apoptosis and necrosis. Flow cytometric analysis of cell-cycle distribution, clonogenic, wound healing, and comet assays provided evidences of the antiproliferative potential of the tested nanoparticles. Apoptosis induction via oxidative stress-mediated Ca2+ release, ROS generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and externalization of phosphatidylserine was also determined biochemically. Relative expression of apoptotic genes was quantified using RT-qPCR and Western blot analysis. Mitotic index analysis, MTT, and hemolytic assays on lymphocytes and erythrocytes clearly revealed the absence of any deleterious effect(s) of SpLZnONPs in these cells compared with the toxicity of the chemically derived cZnONPs, thereby attesting to the biocompatibility and selective action of the biogenic nanoparticles.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: In order to better characterize outcomes of palliative surgery (PS), we evaluated patients that experienced top quartile survival to elucidate predictors of high impact PS. METHODS: All PS performed on advanced cancer patients from 2003 to 2017 were identified from a PS database. RESULTS: 167 patients were identified. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the ability to rise from a chair was independently associated with top quartile survival (HR 7.61, 95% CI 2.12-48.82, p=0.008) as was the need for re-operation (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.26-6.30, p=0.0012). Patients who were able to rise from a chair had significantly prolonged overall survival (320 vs 87 days, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Although not the primary goal, long-term survival can be achieved following PS and is associated with re-operation and the ability to rise from a chair. These patients experience the benefits of PS for a longer period of time, which in turn maximizes value and positive impact. SUMMARY: Long-term survival and symptom control can be achieved in highly selected advanced cancer patients following palliative surgery. The ability of the patient to independently rise from a chair and the provider to offer a re-operation when indicated are associated with long-term survival following a palliative operation.",nocancer
"Adipose tissue has a variety of diverse functions that maintain energy homeostasis. In conditions of excess energy availability, adipose tissue increases its lipid storage and communicates the nutritional abundance to various organs in the body. In conditions of energy depletion, such as fasting, cold exposure, or prolonged exercise, triglycerides stored in adipose tissue are released as free fatty acids to support the shift to catabolic metabolism. These diverse functions of storage, communication, and energy homeostasis are shared between numerous adipose depots including subcutaneous, visceral, brown, beige, intramuscular, marrow, and dermal adipose tissue. As organisms age, the cellular composition of these depots shifts to facilitate increased inflammatory cell infiltration, decreased vasculature, and increased adipocyte quantity and lipid droplet size. The purpose of this review is to give a comprehensive overview of the molecular and cellular changes that occur in various aged adipose depots and discuss their impact on physiology. The molecular signature of aged adipose leads to higher prevalence of metabolic disease in aged populations including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, and certain types of cancer.",nocancer
"Clinical outcomes of conventional drug combinations are not ideal due to high toxicity to healthy tissues. Cisplatin (CDDP) is the standard component for many cancer treatments, yet its principal dose-limiting side effect is nephrotoxicity. Thus, CDDP is commonly used in combination with other drugs, such as the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ), to enhance tumor cell killing efficacy and prevent the development of chemoresistance. In addition, nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems can overcome chemotherapy limitations, decreasing side effects and increasing tumor accumulation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of CQ and CDDP against tumor and non-tumor cells when used in a combined treatment. For this purpose, two types of micelles based on Pluronic  F127 hybrid dendritic-linear-dendritic block copolymers (HDLDBCs) modified with polyester or poly(esteramide) dendrons derived from 2,2'-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (HDLDBC-bMPA) or 2,2'-bis(glycyloxymethyl)propionic acid (HDLDBC-bGMPA) were explored as delivery nanocarriers. Our results indicated that the combined treatment with HDLDBC-bMPA(CQ) or HDLDBC-bGMPA(CQ) and CDDP increased cytotoxicity in tumor cells compared to the single treatment with CDDP. Encapsulations demonstrated less short-term cytotoxicity individually or when used in combination compared to the free drugs. However, and more importantly, a low degree of cytotoxicity against non-tumor cells was maintained, even when drugs were given simultaneously.",nocancer
"Cardiotoxicity is a well-established complication of multiple cancer therapeutics, and the one of the most prominent effects that limits the use of these agents is in the form of left ventricular dysfunction, otherwise known as chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy (CIMP). Because CIMP can worsen patient outcomes and interfere with a patient's life-saving cancer treatments, it is important to implement a monitoring strategy for patients undergoing potentially cardiotoxic treatments. Efforts have been made by multiple societies to provide recommendations for screening and monitoring for CIMP in at-risk patients, with slight variations between guideline documents and expert consensuses. Most of the recommendations for monitoring for CIMP are specific to anthracyclines and the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-antagonist trastuzumab, with very limited guidance for other cardiotoxic agents such as Tyr kinase inhibitors and proteasome inhibitors, which we cover in this article. Echocardiography remains the mainstay for imaging surveillance because of its safety profile and widespread availability, but the accuracy of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) makes it an important modality when there are discrepancies in left ventricular ejection fraction assessment. Subclinical cardiotoxicity may be detected using laboratory biomarkers such as cardiac troponin and brain natriuretic peptide as well as myocardial deformation (strain) imaging by echocardiography or CMR. Specific recommendations for timing and frequency of laboratory biomarker assessment remain up for debate, but myocardial deformation imaging should be performed with every echocardiogram or CMR assessment. Future studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of established surveillance recommendations and to develop specific recommendations for novel cancer therapeutics.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of complex chest and upper back defects can pose a challenge to microsurgeons, especially when prior surgery, scarring, tumor resection, or radiotherapy, have caused a shortage of recipient vessels. Although already being a standard approach for head and neck reconstructions, we investigated whether the indication of the superior thyroid artery (STA) as a safe and universal recipient vessel could be extended for reconstruction in aforementioned regions. METHODS: Seventeen patients received free myocutaneous vastus lateralis (MVL) muscle flaps for reconstruction of upper body defects (chest n = 11; upper back n = 6). In all cases, the STA was used for microvascular anastomosis because of a lack of standard recipient vessels. A retrospective chart review was performed and the data was screened for patients' demographics, intraoperative and perioperative details, flap survival, surgical complications, and overall long-term outcomes. Patients had a minimum follow-up of 6 months. RESULTS: Defects resulted from infections after cardiac surgery (n = 10), infections after spinal neurosurgery (n = 2) or tumor resection (n = 5). Average defect size measured 144.6 (range, 40-286 cm; +-67.9 cm), with a mean size of the MVL free flaps of 266.8 (range, 160-384 cm; +-69.5 cm). The flap success rate was 100%, with minor complications in 4 patients. No major complications were observed in any of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The STA is a viable and safe alternative as a recipient vessel for reconstruction of upper body defects, especially when other vessels in proximity to the defect are deprived.",nocancer
"Celecoxib is one of the most common medicines for treating inflammatory diseases. Recently, it has been shown that celecoxib is associated with implications in complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and cancer, as well as with cardiovascular risk assessment and toxicity, suggesting that celecoxib may affect multiple unknown targets. In this project, we detected targets of celecoxib within the nervous system using a label-free TPP (Thermal Proteome Profiling) method. First, proteins of the rat hippocampus were treated with multiple drug concentrations and temperatures. Next, we separated the soluble proteins from the denatured and sedimented total protein load by ultracentrifugation. Subsequently, the soluble proteins were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine the identity of the celecoxib targeted proteins based on structural changes by thermal stability variation of targeted proteins towards higher solubility in the higher temperatures. In the analysis of the soluble protein extract at 67 centigrade, 44 proteins were uniquely detected in drug-treated samples out of all 478 identified proteins at this temperature. Rab4a, one out of these 44 proteins, has previously been reported as one of the celecoxib off-targets in the rat CNS. Furthermore, we provide more molecular details through biomedical enrichment analysis to explore the potential role of all detected proteins in the biological systems. We show that the determined proteins play a role in the signaling pathways related to neurodegenerative disease - and cancer pathways. Finally, we fill out molecular supporting evidence for using celecoxib towards the drug repurposing approach by exploring drug targets. Significance Statement In this study, we determined forty-four off-target proteins of celecoxib, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, and one of the most common medicines for treating inflammatory diseases. We showed that these proteins play a role in the signaling pathways related to neurodegenerative disease and cancer pathways. Finally, we provided molecular supporting evidence for using celecoxib towards the drug repurposing approach by exploring drug targets.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Few studies have assessed how patient preferences influence end-of-life costs. AIM: To estimate mean monthly healthcare costs in 2019 Singapore Dollars (SGD) at five time points within the last year of life and identify how patients' preferences for the trade-off between treatment cost containment and life-extension and other factors affect these costs. DESIGN: Mean monthly costs were quantified in the last 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12-months before death. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Billing records for 286 deceased participants in the Cost and Medical Care of Patients with Advanced Serious Illness (COMPASS) cancer cohort study in Singapore. RESULTS: Mean monthly costs were $5140 (95% CI: $4750; $5520) in the 12-months before death and rose to $8350 (95% CI: $7110; $9590) 1-month before death. Participants preferring higher cost containment/less life-extension defied the trend of increasing costs closer to death (mean monthly costs of $4630 (95% CI: $3690; $ 5580) and $4850 (95% CI: $2850; $6850) (12-months and 1-month before death respectively). Participants preferring lower cost containment/more life-extension had costs that were $1050 (95% CI: $49; $2051) and $5220 (95% CI: $2320; $8130) higher than those preferring lower costs/less life-extension 12-months and 1-month before death respectively. CONCLUSIONS: On average, cancer patients in Singapore can expect to spend $61,680 in the last year of life. Of broader relevance is that patient preferences and other observable factors clearly influence these costs, suggesting that policymakers and patients can better predict and budget for end-of-life costs by considering these factors.",nocancer
"A series of 2,4-diamino pyrimidine (DAPY) derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as inhibitors of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) with antitumor and anti-angiogenesis activities. Most compounds effectively suppressed the enzymatic activities of FAK, and the IC50s of 11b and 12f were 2.75 and 1.87 nM, respectively. 11b and 12f exhibited strong antiproliferative effects against seven human cancer cells, with IC50 values against two FAK-overexpressing pancreatic cancer cells (PANC-1 and BxPC-3) of 0.98 muM, 0.55 muM, and 0.11 muM, 0.15 muM, respectively. Moreover, 11b and 12f obviously suppressed the colony formation, migration, and invasion of PANC-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, these two compounds could induce the apoptosis of PANC-1 cells and arrest the cell cycle in G2/M phase according to the flow cytometry assay. Western blot revealed that 11b and 12f effectively inhibited the FAK/PI3K/Akt signal pathway and significantly decreased the expression of cyclin D1 and Bcl-2. In addition, compounds 11b and 12f potently inhibited the antiproliferative of HUVECs and obviously altered the cell morphology. 11b and 12f also significantly inhibited the migration, tube formation of HUVECs and severely impaired the angiogenesis in the zebrafish model. Overall, these results revealed the potential of compounds 11b and 12f as promising candidates for further preclinical studies.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Contrast-free visualization of microvascular blood flow (MBF) using ultrasound can play a valuable role in diagnosis and detection of diseases. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of quantifying ensemble coherence for robust MBF imaging. We propose a novel approach to quantify ensemble coherence by estimating the local spatiotemporal correlation (LSTC) image, and evaluate its efficacy through simulation and in vivo studies. METHODS: The in vivo patient studies included 3 volunteers with a suspicious breast tumor, 15 volunteers with a suspicious thyroid tumor, and 2 healthy volunteers for renal MBF imaging. The breast data displayed negligible prior motion and was used for simulation analysis involving synthetically induced motion, to assess its impact on ensemble coherency and motion artifacts in MBF images. The in vivo thyroid data involved complex physiological motion due to its proximity to the pulsating carotid artery, which was used to assess the in vivo efficacy of the proposed technique. Further, in vivo renal MBF images demonstrated the feasibility of using the proposed ensemble coherence metric for curved-array based MBF imaging involving phase conversion. All ultrasound data were acquired at high imaging frame rates and the tissue signal was suppressed using spatiotemporal clutter filtering. Thyroid tissue motion was estimated using 2D normalized cross-correlation based speckle tracking, which was subsequently used for ensemble motion correction. The coherence of the MBF image was quantified based on Casorati correlation of the Doppler ensemble. RESULTS: The simulation results demonstrated that an increase in ensemble motion corresponded with a decrease in ensemble coherency, which reciprocally degraded the MBF images. Further the data acquired from breast tumors demonstrated higher ensemble coherency than that from thyroid tumors. Motion correction improved the coherence of the thyroid MBF images, which substantially improved its visualization. The proposed coherence metrics were also useful in assessing the ensemble coherence for renal MBF imaging. The results also demonstrated that the proposed coherence metric can be reliably estimated from downsampled ensembles (by up to 90%), thus allowing improved computational efficiency for potential applications in real-time MBF imaging. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study demonstrates the importance of assessing ensemble coherency in contrast-free MBF imaging. The proposed LSTC image quantified coherence of the Doppler ensemble for robust MBF imaging. The results obtained from this pilot study are promising, and warrant further development and in vivo validation.",nocancer
"Background/Aims: Although people with diabetes have been shown to have higher mortality than people without diabetes, there is a lack of data on the association between fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels and cause-specific mortality rates in the general population. Methods: A total of 326,547 Korean adults over 20 years of age, who had received a health checkup between 2006 and 2008 were selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Service sample cohort dataset and followed until 2015. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality relative to various range of FPG levels. All causes of death were classified according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 codes. Results: During follow-up (mean, 8.5 years), a total of 13,536 deaths (mortality rate 4.89/1,000 person-year) occurred; 4,916 deaths from cancer, 2,133 from cardiovascular disease, 762 from infectious disease, 199 from renal disease, and 5,526 from other causes. The overall mortality rate increased with an increase in FPG category (HR, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.65 to 1.92; in the >= 160 mg/dL). In addition, a J-shaped associations was found between FPG levels and all-cause mortality after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, drinking, physical activity, body mass index, diabetes mellitus medication, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. In particular, the risk of cancer-mortality with high FPG levels was increased for men but not women. Conclusions: The risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality showed the tendency to increase when the FPG level was outside of the normal range, indicating a J-shaped relationship, in both men and women.",nocancer
"Machine learning (ML)- and deep learning (DL)-based imaging modalities have exhibited the capacity to handle extremely high dimensional data for a number of computer vision tasks. While these approaches have been applied to numerous data types, this capacity can be especially leveraged by application on histopathological images, which capture cellular and structural features with their high-resolution, microscopic perspectives. Already, these methodologies have demonstrated promising performance in a variety of applications like disease classification, cancer grading, structure and cellular localizations, and prognostic predictions. A wide range of pathologies requiring histopathological evaluation exist in gastroenterology and hepatology, indicating these as disciplines highly targetable for integration of these technologies. Gastroenterologists have also already been primed to consider the impact of these algorithms, as development of real-time endoscopic video analysis software has been an active and popular field of research. This heightened clinical awareness will likely be important for future integration of these methods and to drive interdisciplinary collaborations on emerging studies. To provide an overview on the application of these methodologies for gastrointestinal and hepatological histopathological slides, this review will discuss general ML and DL concepts, introduce recent and emerging literature using these methods, and cover challenges moving forward to further advance the field.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: P-glycoprotein (P-gp) over-expression plays a vital role in not only systemic drug bioavailability but also cancer multi-drug resistance (MDR). Develop functional inhibitors of P-gp can conquer both problems. PURPOSE AND STUDY DESIGN: The aim of the present study was to research the P-gp modulating effects and MDR reversing ability of a novel flavonoid from Fissistigma cupreonitens, the underlying inhibitory mechanisms were further elucidated as well. METHODS: Calcein-AM, rhodamine 123, and doxorubicin were fluorescent substrates for the evaluation of P-gp inhibitory function and detailed drug binding modes. Docking simulation was performed to reveal the in silico molecular bonding. ATPase assay and MDR1 shift assay were adopted to reveal the ATP consumption and conformational change of P-gp. The MDR reversing effects were demonstrated through cytotoxicity, cell cycle, and apoptosis analyses. RESULTS: 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavanone inhibited the efflux of rhodamine 123 and doxorubicin in a competitive manner, and increased the intracellular fluorescence of calcein at a concentration as low as 2.5 mug/ml. 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavanone slightly changed P-gp's conformation and only stimulated ATPase at very high concentration (100 mug/ml). The docking results showed that 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavanone and verapamil exhibited similar binding affinity to P-gp. The MDR reversing effects were prominent in the vincristine group, the reversal folds were 23.01 and 13.03 when combined with 10 mug/ml 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavanone in the P-gp over-expressing cell line (ABCB1/Flp-In -293) and MDR cancer cell line (KB/VIN), respectively. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrated that 5-hydroxy-7,8-dimethoxyflavanone was a novel effective flavonoid in the P-gp efflux inhibition and in vitro cancer MDR reversion.",nocancer
"Recent findings suggest that tumor microenvironment (TME) plays an important regulatory role in the occurrence, proliferation, and metastasis of tumors. Different from normal tissue, the condition around tumor significantly altered, including immune infiltration, compact extracellular matrix, new vasculatures, abundant enzyme, acidic pH value, and hypoxia. Increasingly, researchers focused on targeting TME to prevent tumor development and metastasis. With the development of nanotechnology and the deep research on the tumor environment, stimulation-responsive intelligent nanostructures designed based on TME have attracted much attention in the anti-tumor drug delivery system. TME-targeted nano therapeutics can regulate the distribution of drugs in the body, specifically increase the concentration of drugs in the tumor site, so as to enhance the efficacy and reduce adverse reactions, can utilize particular conditions of TME to improve the effect of tumor therapy. This paper summarizes the major components and characteristics of TME, discusses the principles and strategies of relevant nano-architectures targeting TME for the treatment and diagnosis systematically.",nocancer
"The amino-acid catabolizing enzyme Interleukin-4 induced gene 1 (IL4I1) remains poorly characterized despite it is emerging as a pertinent therapeutic target for cancer. IL4I1 is secreted in the synaptic cleft by antigen-presenting cells. It inhibits TCR signaling, modulates naive T cell differentiation and limits effector T cell proliferation. IL4I1 expression in tumors shapes the tumor microenvironment and impairs the antitumor cytotoxic T cell response, thereby facilitating cancer immune escape. Several mechanisms participate in these effects. Recent data suggest a role of new IL4I1 metabolites in activation of the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Here, we observe that expression of IL4I1 is poorly correlated with that of validated targets of AHR in human cancers. Moreover, dendritic cells do not upregulate AHR target genes in relation with IL4I1 expression in vivo. Finally, IL4I1 activity toward tryptophan leading to production of AHR-activating products is very low, and should be negligible when tryptophan-degrading enzymes of higher affinity compete for the substrate. We recently showed that IL4I1 expression by dendritic cells directly regulates immune synapse formation and modulates the repertoire and memory differentiation of responding CD8 T cells after viral infection. Thus, IL4I1 may restrain tumor control through regulating the priming of tumor-specific CD8 T cells, independently of AHR activation.",nocancer
"The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) 20 years ago has advocated a new era of ""small molecular genetics."" About 2000 miRNAs are present that regulate one third of the genome. MiRNA dysregulated expression arising as a response to our environment insult or stress or changes may contribute to several diseases, namely non-communicable diseases, including tumor growth. Their presence in body fluids, reflecting level alteration in various cancers, merit circulating miRNAs as the ""next-generation biomarkers"" for early-stage tumor diagnosis and/or prognosis. Herein, we performed a comprehensive literature search focusing on the origin, biosynthesis, and role of miRNAs and summarized the foremost studies centering on miR value as non-invasive biomarkers in different environment-related non-communicable diseases, including various cancer types. Moreover, during chemotherapy, many miRNAs were linked to multidrug resistance, via modulating numerous, environment triggered or not, biological processes and/or pathways that will be highlighted as well.",nocancer
"Photoresponsive ruthenium (Ru) complexes have been extensively studied in the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. The metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption maximum of most Ru complexes is located in the short-wavelength visible region, which is well suited for superficial tumors but shows inefficient therapeutic effects for more deep-seated ones. Moreover, Ru complexes are primarily located in the mitochondria or nucleus, always resulting in high levels of dark toxicity and DNA mutation. Herein, we reported a new ruthenium complex (Ru-I) for red-light-triggered PDT. The activation wavelength of Ru-I is successfully extended to 660 nm. Importantly, the complex photosensitizer can be quickly taken up by cancer cells and selectively accumulated in the lysosome, an ideal localization for PDT purposes. Intratumoral injection of Ru-I into tumor-bearing mice achieved excellent therapeutic effects and thus holds great promise for applications in lysosome localization photodynamic therapy.",nocancer
"Oligomycin A is a potent antibiotic and antitumor agent. However, its applications are restricted by its high toxicity and low bioavailability. In this study, we obtained Oligomycin A Diels-Alder adducts with benzoquinone and N-benzylmaleimide and determined their absolute configurations by combining 1H and ROESY NMR data with molecular mechanics conformational analysis and quantum chemical reaction modeling. The latter showed that adduct stereochemistry is controlled by hydrogen bonding of the Oligomycin A side-chain isopropanol moiety with the carbonyl group of the dienophile. Biological studies showed that the Diels-Alder modification of the Oligomycin A diene system resulted in a complex antiproliferative potential pattern. The synthesized adducts were determined to be more active against the triple-negative (ERalpha, PR, and HER2 negative) breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and lung carcinoma cell line A-549 compared to Oligomycin A. Meanwhile, Oligomycin A was more potent against myeloid leukemia cell line K-562 and breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 than its derivatives. Thus, modification of the diene moiety of Oligomycin A is a promising strategy for developing novel antitumor agents based on its scaffold.",nocancer
"The era of real-time radiotherapy is upon us. Robotic and gimbaled linac tracking are clinically established technologies with the clinical realization of couch tracking in development. Multileaf collimators (MLCs) are standard equipment for most cancer radiotherapy systems, and therefore MLC tracking is a potentially widely available technology. MLC tracking has been the subject of theoretical and experimental research for decades and was first implemented for patient treatments in 2013. The AAPM Task Group 264-Safe Clinical Implementation of MLC Tracking in Radiotherapy Report was charged to proactively provide the broader radiation oncology community with 1) clinical implementation guidelines including hardware, software, and clinical indications for use, 2) commissioning and quality assurance recommendations based on early user experience, as well as guidelines on Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, and 3) a discussion of potential future developments. The deliverables from this report include: an explanation of MLC tracking and its historical development; terms and definitions relevant to MLC tracking; the clinical benefit of, clinical experience with and clinical implementation guidelines for MLC tracking; quality assurance guidelines, including example quality assurance worksheets; a clinical decision pathway, future outlook and overall recommendations.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Macrophages and inflammatory cytokines play important roles in bone fracture healing. However, the expression patterns of macrophages and inflammatory cytokines during fracture healing under the condition of postmenopausal osteoporosis have not been fully revealed. METHODS: Tibia transverse fracture was established 12 weeks after ovariectomy or sham operation in 16-week old female mice. Tibias were harvested before fracture or 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28 days after fracture for radiological and histological examinations. M1/M2 inflammatory macrophages, osteal macrophages and gene expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, interleukin-1beta and macrophage conversion related molecules in the fracture haematoma or callus were also detected. RESULTS: The processes of fracture healing, especially the phases of endochondral ossification and callus remodeling, were delayed in ovariectomized mice. The expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6, but not interleukin-1beta, in the fracture haematoma or callus were disturbed. Expressions of tumor necrosis factor-alpha were decreased at 1, 14 and 21 days post-fracture (DPF), and were increased at 3, 5 and 7 DPF. Interleukin-6 expressions at 1, 3 and 21 DPF were significantly increased. We found the decreases in M1 and M2 macrophages at 1 DPF of the initial inflammatory stage. M2 macrophages at 14 DPF of the middle stage and osteal macrophages at 14, 21 and 28 DPF of the middle and late stages of fracture healing were also reduced in ovariectomized mice. CONCLUSIONS: The expressions of macrophages and inflammatory cytokines were impaired in ovariectomized mice, which might contribute partially to poor fracture healing.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: The present study assessed the predictive value of peritumoral regions on three tumor tasks, and further explored the influence of peritumors with different sizes. METHODS: We retrospectively collected 333 samples of gastrointestinal stromal tumors from Zhejiang Hospital, and 183 samples of gastrointestinal stromal tumors from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital. We also collected 211 samples of laryngeal carcinoma and 233 samples of nasopharyngeal carcinoma from the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University. The tasks of three tumor datasets were risk assessment (gastrointestinal stromal tumor), T3/T4 staging prediction (laryngeal carcinoma), and distant metastasis prediction (nasopharyngeal carcinoma), respectively. Firstly, deep learning and radiomics were respectively used to construct peritumoral models, to study whether the peritumor had predictive value on three tumor datasets. Furthermore, we defined different sizes peritumors including fixed size (not considering tumor size) and adaptive size (according to average tumor radius) to explore the influence of peritumor of different sizes and types of tumors. Finally, we visualized the deep learning and radiomic models to observe the influence of the peritumor in three datasets. RESULTS: The performance of intra-peritumors are better than intratumors alone in three datasets. Specifically, the comparisons of area under receiver operating characteristic curve in the testing set between intra-peritumoral and intratumoral models are: 0.908 vs 0.873 (Pvalue: 0.037) in gastrointestinal stromal tumor datasets, 0.796 vs 0.756 (Pvalue: 0.188) in laryngeal carcinoma datasets and 0.660 vs 0.579 (Pvalue: 0.431) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma datasets. Furthermore, for gastrointestinal stromal tumor datasets, deep learning is more stable to learn peritumors with both fixed and adaptive size than radiomics. For laryngeal carcinoma datasets, the intra-peritumoral radiomic model could make model performance more balanced. For nasopharyngeal carcinoma datasets, radiomics is also more suitable for modeling peritumors than deep learning. The size of the peritumor is critical in this task, and only the performance of 1.5 mm-4.5 mm peritumors are stable. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that peritumors have additional predictive value in three tumor datasets through deep learning or radiomics. The definitions of the peritumoral region and artificial intelligence method also have great influence on the performance of the peritumor.",nocancer
"Glucose detection is a crucial topic in the diagnosis of numerous diseases, such as hypoglycemia or diabetes mellitus. Research indicates that people with diabetes mellitus are at a higher risk of developing various types of cancer. A nanoplatform that combines both diabetes diagnosis and cancer therapy might be regarded as a more effective way to solve the above-mentioned problem. However, none of the known sensors has a smart strategy that can work as a fluorescent glucose sensor and a cancer therapeutic platform simultaneously. Here, we developed a pH responsive biomimetic-mineralized nanoplatform (denoted as CaCO3-PDA@DOX-GOx) for glucose detection in serum samples and applied it to treat the tumor cells combined chemotherapy with the starvation therapy in vitro. Doxorubicin (DOX) and glucose oxidase (GOx) were loaded through the mesoporous CaCO3-PDA nanoparticles (m-CaCO3-PDA NPs). The fluorescence of DOX is quenched as a result of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) caused by the broad absorption of m-CaCO3-PDA NPs. The nanoplatform would recover fluorescence under lower pH values due to the catalytic reaction of GOx with glucose or tumor microenvironment (TME), which leads to the elimination of FRET. Its application as a glucose sensor is indicated with a linear relationship in the range of 0.01-1.0 mM of glucose and limit of detection is calculated by 6 muM. This nanoplatform also has a TME-responsive antitumor effect and fluorescence imaging functionality, which provide a new idea for cancer therapy together with glucose monitoring in diabetes.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards (ACHS) sponsored an expert-led, consensus-driven, four-stage process, based on a modified Delphi methodology, to determine a set of clinical indicators as quality measures of cancer service provision in Australia. This was done in response to requests from institutional health care providers seeking accreditation, which were additional and complementary to the existing radiation oncology set. The steering group members comprised multidisciplinary key opinion leaders and a consumer representative. Five additional participants constituted the stakeholder group, who deliberated on the final indicator set. METHODS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: An initial meeting of the steering group scoped the high level nature of the desired set. In stage 2, 65 candidate indicators were identified by a literature review and a search of international metrics. These were ranked by survey, based on ease of data accessibility and collectability and clinical relevance. The top 27 candidates were debated by the stakeholder group and culled to a final set of 16 indicators. A user manual was created with indicators mapped to clinical codes. The indicator set was ratified by the Clinical Oncology Society of Australia and is now available for use by health care organisations participating in the ACHS Clinical Indicator Program. This inaugural cancer clinical indicator set covers high level assessment of various critical processes in cancer service provision in Australia. Regular reviews and updates will ensure usability. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AS A RESULT OF THIS STATEMENT: This is the inaugural indicator set for cancer care for use across Australia and internationally under the ACHS Clinical Indicator Program. Multidisciplinary involvement through a modified Delphi process selected indicators representing both generic and specific aspects of care across the cancer journey pathway and will provide a functional tool to compare health care delivery across multiple settings. It is anticipated that this will drive continual improvement in cancer care provision.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Although epidemiological studies report a lower risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than in the Western world, VTE rates in Asia may be underestimated. Furthermore, it is uncertain whether VTE outcomes differ in Asia and the rest of the world (ROW). METHODS: GARFIELD-VTE is a global, prospective, non-interventional study of real-world treatment practices. In this study, we compared baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, and 12-month outcomes in Asia and ROW. RESULTS: Of the 10,684 enrolled patients, 1822 (17.1%) were Asian (China n = 420, Hong Kong n = 98, Japan n = 148, Malaysia n = 244, South Korea n = 343, Taiwan n = 232, Thailand n = 337). Compared with ROW patients, those from Asia were more often female (57.4% vs. 48.0%), non-smokers (74.0% vs. 58.9%) and had a lower BMI (24.8 kg/m2 vs. 29.1 kg/m2). Asian patients were more likely to be managed in the hospital (86.9% vs. 70.4%) and to have active cancer (19.8% vs. 8.1%) or a history of cancer (19.1% vs. 12.0%). Asian patients received no anticoagulation more frequently than ROW patients (6.5% vs. 2.1%). Over 12-months follow-up, the rate of all-cause mortality (per 100 person-years [95% confidence interval]) was higher in Asians (15.2 [13.4-17.3] vs. 5.9 [5.4-6.5]). Adjusted hazard ratios indicated a higher risk of all-cause mortality in Asian patients than the ROW (1.32 [1.08-1.62]). The frequencies of major bleeding and recurrent VTE were similar. CONCLUSION: Asian patients have different risk profiles, treatment patterns and a higher risk of mortality compared with the ROW.",nocancer
"Amyloidosis is a heterogeneous group of diseases in which the extracellular deposition of abnormal fibrillar proteins disrupts tissue structure and function. Intestinal involvement is a very rare manifestation of amyloidosis compared to the most affected organs, the heart and kidneys. Damage of the gastrointestinal tract may be the only manifestation of amyloidosis, or - more often - is a component of the involvement of several organs in systemic amyloidosis. Any part of the digestive tract can be involved; however, the small bowel is the most affected part, followed by the colon. Intestinal amyloidosis is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical picture, with weight loss, chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, intestinal bleeding, or pseudo-obstruction. Endoscopic findings are characterized by a fine granular appearance, erosions, ulcerations, mucosal friability, multiple protrusions, or tumor-like lesions. Pathologic examination allows for a definitive diagnosis using Congo red staining and a positive sample with apple-green birefringence. The disease can easily be misdiagnosed with several other diseases of the digestive tract and lead to diagnostic challenges in clinical practice. Further, the amyloid colonic deposition may mimic inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, ischemic colitis, and collagenous colitis. Therefore, gastroenterologists need to include amyloidosis in their diagnostic work-up.",nocancer
"Radiotherapy is one of the three main treatments for tumors. Almost 70% of tumor patients undergo radiotherapy at different periods. Although radiotherapy can enhance the local control rate of tumors and patients' quality of life, normal tissues often show radiation damage following radiotherapy. In recent years, several studies have shown that exosomes could be biomarkers for diseases and be involved in the treatment of radiation damage. Exosomes are nanoscale vesicles containing complex miRNAs and proteins. They can regulate the inflammatory response, enhance the regeneration effect of damaged tissue, and promote the repair of damaged tissues and cells, extending their survival time. In addition, their functions are achieved by paracrine signaling. In this review, we discuss the potential of exosomes as biomarkers and introduce the impact of exosomes on radiation damage in different organs and the hematopoietic system in detail.",nocancer
"While technological advances in radiation oncology have led to a more precise delivery of radiation dose and a decreased risk of side effects, there is still a need to better understand the mechanisms underlying DNA damage response (DDR) at the DNA and cytogenetic levels, and to overcome tumor resistance. To maintain genomic stability, cells have developed sophisticated signaling pathways enabling cell cycle arrest to facilitate DNA repair via the DDR-related kinases and their downstream targets, so that DNA damage or DNA replication stress induced by genotoxic therapies can be resolved. ATM, ATR, and Chk1 kinases are key mediators in DDR activation and crucial factors in treatment resistance. It is of importance, therefore, as an alternative to the conventional clonogenic assay, to establish a cytogenetic assay enabling reliable and time-efficient results in evaluating the potency of DDR inhibitors for radiosensitization. Toward this goal, the present study aims at the development and optimization of a chromosomal radiosensitivity assay using the DDR and G2-checkpoint inhibitors as a novel modification compared to the classical G2-assay. Also, it aims at investigating the strengths of this assay for rapid radiosensitivity assessments in cultured cells, and potentially, in tumor cells obtained from biopsies. Specifically, exponentially growing RPE and 82-6 hTERT human cells are irradiated during the G2/M-phase transition in the presence or absence of Caffeine, VE-821, and UCN-1 inhibitors of ATM/ATR, ATR, and Chk1, respectively, and the induced chromatid breaks are used to evaluate cell radiosensitivity and their potency for radiosensitization. The increased yield of chromatid breaks in the presence of DDR inhibitors, which underpins radiosensitization, is similar to that observed in cells from highly radiosensitive AT-patients, and is considered here as 100% radiosensitive internal control. The results highlight the potential of our modified G2-assay using VE-821 to evaluate cell radiosensitivity, the efficacy of DDR inhibitors in radiosensitization, and reinforce the concept that ATM, ATR, and Chk1 represent attractive anticancer drug targets in radiation oncology.",nocancer
"Cryptotanshinone (IUPAC name: (R)-1,2,6,7,8,9-hexahydro-1,6,6-trimethyl-phenanthro(1,2-b)furan-10,11-dione), a biologically active constituent extracted from the roots and rhizomes of the plant Salvia miltiorrhiza, has been studied in depth as a medicinally active compound and shown to have efficacy in the treatment of numerous diseases and disorders. In this review, we describe in detail the current status of cryptotanshinone research, including findings relating to the structure, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological activity, and derivatives of this compound. Cryptotanshinoneh as a diverse range of pharmacological effects, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, immune regulatory, neuroprotective, and anti-fibrosis activities. Studies on the molecular mechanisms underlying the activities of cryptotanshinone have established that the JAK2/STAT3, PI3K/AKT, NF-kappaB, AMPK, and cell cycle pathways are involved in the inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects of cryptotanshinone on different tumor cell lines, these molecular pathways interact in a coordinated manner to inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion,and induce transformation, autophagy, necrosis, and cellular immunity. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of cryptotanshinone have been found to be associated with the TLR4-MyD88/PI3K/Nrf2 and TLR4-MyD88/NF-kappaB/MAPK pathways, whereasthe Hedgehog, NF-kappaB, and Nrf-2/HO-1 pathways are regulated by cryptotanshinone to reduce organ fibrosis, and its inhibitory effects on the PI3K/AKT-eNOS pathway have been linked to neuroprotective effects. Given the potential medicinal utility of cryptotanshinone, further research is needed to verify the efficacy and safety of this compound in clinical use, evaluate its pharmacological activity, and identify molecular targets.",nocancer
"Inflammatory bowel disease, encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis, are chronic immune-mediated inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that primarily affect the gastrointestinal tract with periods of activity and remission. Large body of evidence exist to strengthen the prognostic role of endoscopic evaluation for both disease activity and severity and it remains the gold standard for the assessment of mucosal healing. Mucosal healing has been associated with improved clinical outcomes with prolonged remission, decreased hospitalization, IBD-related surgeries and colorectal cancer risk. Therefore, endoscopic objectives in IBD have been incorporated as part of standard care. With the known increased risk of colorectal cancer in IBD, although prevention strategies continue to develop, regular surveillance for early detection of neoplasia continue to be paramount in IBD patients' care. It is thanks to evolving technology and visualization techniques that surveillance strategies are continuously advancing. Therapeutic endoscopic options in IBD have also been expanding, from surgery sparing therapies such as balloon dilation of fibrostenotic strictures in CD to endoscopic mucosal resection of neoplastic lesions. In this review article, we discuss the current evidence on the use of endoscopy as part of standard of care of IBD, its role in surveillance of neoplasia, and the role of interventional endoscopic therapies.",nocancer
"Objective: At present, though the laparoscopic delta-shaped anastomosis and overlapping delta-shaped anastomosis have been gradually applied to complete laparoscopic radical resection of left hemicolon cancer, the comparative evaluation of their efficacy has not been mentioned in the published literatures. This study aims to explore the safety, feasibility and short-term efficacy of overlapping delta-shaped anastomosis (ODA) in totally laparoscopic left hemicolectomy. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed. The clinical and pathological data of patients who underwent totally laparoscopic left hemicolectomy at Department of Colorectal Surgery, Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College from May 2017 to October 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The case inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) age of 18-75 years; (2) body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-30 kg/m(2); (3) descending colonic and proximal sigmoid colonic adenocarcinoma was confirmed by preoperative colonoscopy and pathology. The exclusion criteria: (1) multiple primary colorectal cancers; (2) uncontrolled or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, immune system diseases, or hematological diseases; (3) severe intestinal obstruction; (4) left transverse colonic or splenic flexure colonic adenocarcinoma; (5) distant metastasis of liver, lung and other viscera determined by enhanced computed tomography in the chest, abdomen and pelvis. According to the above criteria, a total of 115 patients with left hemicolon cancer were enrolled. All the patients underwent totally laparoscopic left hemicolectomy. Patients who underwent laparoscopic traditional delta-shaped anastomosis were selected as the control group. Patients who underwent laparoscopic ODA were selected as the ODA group. Effects of these two laparoscopic reconstruction methods on postoperative recovery and perioperative complications were analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 60 patients were enrolled in the ODA group, including 32 males and 28 females, with mean age of (57.3+-10.4) years and body mass index (BMI) of (25.0+-3.1) kg/m(2). While mean 55 patients were enrolled in the control group, including 31 males and 24 females, with mean age of (56.7+-9.9) years and BMI of (24.4+-2.9) kg/m(2). There was no statistically significant differences between the two groups in gender, age, BMI, American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) classification, TNM staging, preoperative abdominal surgery history, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and nutritional status (levels of hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, prealbumin, and albumin) (all P>0.05). All the patients in both groups received R0 resection without conversion to open laparotomy or conversion to extra-abdominal anastomosis. The digestive tract reconstruction time of the ODA group was significantly shorter than that of the control group [(15.1+-1.7) minutes vs. (15.9+-2.4) minutes, t=-2.053, P=0.042]. There were no statistically significant differences in the total operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of skin incision, tumor size, proximal and distal margins, harvested lymph nodes, postoperative first ambulatory time, and postoperative hospital stay (all P>0.05). However, the time to the first flatus and the first defecation in the ODA group was significantly shorter as compared to control group [(1.5+-0.5) days vs. (1.7+-0.5) days, t=-2.028, P=0.045; (3.1+-0.6) days vs. (3.4+-0.7) days, t=-2.095, P=0.039], indicating faster intestinal function recovery in patients with ODA. The morbidity of postoperative complication was 6.7% (4/60) in the ODA group and 7.3% (4/55) in the control group and no significant difference was found (chi(2)=0.016, P=0.898). Two cases of incision infection, 1 case of lung infection, and 1 case of intra-abdominal infection occurred in the ODA group, while 3 cases of lung infection and 1 case of intra-abdominal infection occurred in the control group. All these complications were resolved after conservative treatment, and no secondary operation was performed due to complications. Conclusion: Compared with the traditional delta-shaped anastomosis, ODA is associated with a faster recovery of postoperative intestinal function without increasing the morbidity of postoperative complications, and has the satisfactory short-term efficacy.",nocancer

"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is one of the main cytokines regulating a pro-inflammatory environment. It has been related to several cell functions, for instance, phagocytosis, apoptosis, proliferation, mitochondrial dynamic. Moreover, during mycobacterial infections, TNF plays an essential role to maintain granuloma formation. Several effector mechanisms have been implicated according to the interactions of the two active forms, soluble TNF (solTNF) and transmembrane TNF (tmTNF), with their receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2. We review the impact of these interactions in the context of mycobacterial infections. TNF is tightly regulated by binding to receptors, however, during mycobacterial infections, upstream activation signalling pathways may be influenced by key regulatory factors either at the membrane or cytosol level. Detailing the structure and activation pathways used by TNF and its receptors, such as its interaction with solTNF/TNFRs versus tmTNF/TNFRs, may bring a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in activation pathways which can be helpful for the development of new therapies aimed at being more efficient against mycobacterial infections.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To describe the kinetics of the peripheral blood components after radiotherapy, to examine radiation exposure vs. End-of-Radiation-Therapy (EoRT) counts and to associate the EoRT lymphocyte count with death and cancer treatment failure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cohort study of patients who received curative intent radiotherapy for solid tumor diagnoses from 2009-2016 at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen and had available 3D radiation exposure data. We illustrated peripheral blood count kinetics within 12 months before and after radiotherapy start and analyzed the impact of the irradiated body volume. We investigated overall survival and cancer treatment failure according to EoRT lymphopenia using Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: We analyzed 4055 patients with both pre-treatment and EoRT platelet counts and 2318 patients who also had neutrophil and lymphocyte counts. Only the lymphocyte decline after radiotherapy start was clinically relevant and remained low one year after radiotherapy. The higher the volume of the body exposed to radiation, the lower the EoRT blood counts. Female gender (p<0.001), number of fractions (p=0.010), dose-volume (p<0.001) and concomitant use of chemotherapy, particularly the platinum compounds (p<0.001) were independently associated with a lower EoRT lymphocyte count. Patients with head and neck cancer had the lowest EoRT lymphocyte count. Patients with lymphopenia had a higher risk of death in the year after radiotherapy, compared with patients with no lymphopenia. CONCLUSION: Radiation schemes with fewer fractions and radiation techniques allowing reduction of the volume of the body exposed to radiation could be expected to better preserve patients' immune function.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the recurrence of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) that has been relieved by standard-dose adalimumab (ADA) after dose reduction or withdrawal of tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitor (TNFi) and explore the factors that predict AS occurrence. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted among 63 patients with AS who reduced the dose of or discontinued TNFi after completing at least 12 treatment cycles with ADA (40 mg/2 weeks) to achieve ASAS20 improvement with a BATH disease activity index (BASDAI) < 4 for more than 8 weeks. The patients were followed up every 12 weeks for a total of 52 weeks, and the recurrence of AS, changes of BASDAI, C-reactive protein (CRP)-based disease activity score (ASDASCRP), low back pain (LBP) score, Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI), CRP and ESR were recorded and analyzed. Cox regression model and ROC curve analyses were performed to analyze the risk factors of AS relapse after dose reduction or discontinuation of TNFi. OBJECTIVE: Of the 63 patients enrolled, 57 completed the follow-up study, among whom 22 (38.6%) patients experienced AS relapse within 52 weeks, with a median clinical recurrence time of 31 weeks. The recurrence rate of AS was significantly higher in patients with complete withdrawal of medications (89.0%) than in those with TNFi dose reduction and TNFi discontinuation (P < 0.001), and did not differ significantly between the latter two groups of patients (chi2= 0.071, P=0.791). The Cox regression model showed that a high baseline LBP score (HR=1.438, P=0.027) and a high BASMI score (HR=1.29, P=0.049) were the risk factors for AS recurrence after TNFi dose reduction or discontinuation, while maintenance of medication during follow-up was a protective factor (HR=0.209, P=0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that the combination of baseline LBP score, BASMI and medication during follow-up had a good predictive value for AS relapse (AUC=0.819) with a sensitivity of 0.772 and a specificity of 0.718. OBJECTIVE: Dose reduction or discontinuation of TNFi is associated with a high recurrence rate of AS that has been relieved by TNFi treatment. A high LBP score, a high BASMI score and discontinuation of maintenance medication are the risk factors for AS recurrence in patients after dose reduction or withdrawal of TNFi.",nocancer
"The preparation of two polyarginine conjugates of the complex Os(II) [bis-(4'-(4-carboxyphenyl)-2,2':6',2''-terpyridine)] [Os-(Rn)2]x+ (n = 4 and 8; x = 10 and 18) is reported, to explore whether the R8 peptide sequence that promotes cell uptake requires a contiguous amino acid sequence for membrane permeation or if this can be accomplished in a linearly bridged structure with the additive effect of shorter peptide sequences. The conjugates exhibit NIR emission centered at 754 nm and essentially oxygen-insensitive emission with a lifetime of 89 ns in phosphate-buffered saline. The uptake, distribution, and cytotoxicity of the parent complex and peptide derivatives were compared in 2D cell monolayers and a three-dimensional (3D) multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) model. Whereas, the bis-octaarginine sequences were impermeable to cells and spheroids, and the bis-tetraarginine conjugate showed excellent cellular uptake and accumulation in two 2D monolayer cell lines and remarkable in-depth penetration of 3D MCTSs of pancreatic cancer cells. Overall, the data indicates that cell permeability can be promoted via non-contiguous sequences of arginine residues bridged across the metal centre.",nocancer
"Ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatases/phosphodiesterases (NPPs) together with nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases) and alkaline phosphatases (APs) are nucleotidases located at the surface of the cells. NPP1 and NPP3 are important members of NPP family that are known as druggable targets for a number of disorders such as impaired calcification, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. Sulfonylurea derivatives have been reported as antidiabetic and anticancer agents, therefore, we synthesized and investigated series of sulfonylurea derivatives 1a-m possessing pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine core as inhibitors of NPP1 and NPP3 isozymes that are over-expressed in cancer and diabetes. The enzymatic evaluation highlighted compound 1a as selective NPP1 inhibitor, however, 1c was observed as the most potent inhibitor of NPP1 with an IC50 value of 0.80 +- 0.04 muM. Compound 1l was found to be the most potent and moderately selective inhibitor of NPP3 (IC50 = 0.55 +- 0.01 muM). Furthermore, in vitro cytotoxicity assays of compounds 1a-m against MCF-7 and HT-29 cancer cell lines exhibited compound 1c (IC50 = 4.70 +- 0.67 muM), and 1h (IC50 = 1.58 +- 0.20 muM) as the most cytotoxic compounds against MCF-7 and HT-29 cancer cell lines, respectively. Both of the investigated compounds showed high degree of selectivity towards cancer cells than normal cells (WI-38). Molecular docking studies of selective and potent enzyme inhibitors revealed promising mode of interactions with important binding sites residues of both isozymes i.e., Thr256, His380, Lys255, Asn277 residues of NPP1 and His329, Thr205, and Leu239 residues of NPP3. In addition, the most potent antiproliferative agent, compound 1h, doesn't produce hypoglycemia as a side effect when injected to mice.

"Despite the growing number of adult transgender and gender diverse (TGD) patients seeking health services, there are many unknowns regarding how routine screening recommendations should be applied to TGD persons receiving gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). Patients taking GAHT may have disease risks that differ from what is expected based on their sex assigned at birth or affirmed gender identity. We discuss two patient cases, one transgender man and one transgender woman who present for routine medical care, to review several conditions that may be impacted by the hormones utilized in masculinizing and feminizing GAHT and for which screening recommendations are available for TGD adults: cardiovascular risk factors, osteoporosis, breast cancer, cervical cancer, and prostate cancer. We reviewed the TGD-specific screening recommendations from several major medical organizations and programs and found them to be largely based upon expert opinion due to a lack of evidence. The goal of this narrative review is to assist healthcare professionals in counseling and screening their TGD patients when and where appropriate. Not all TGD adults have the ability or need to receive routine medical care from a specialized TGD health clinic; therefore, it is essential for all healthcare professionals involved in routine and gender-affirming care to have knowledge about these conditions and screenings.",nocancer
"P-glycoprotein, encoded by ATP-binding cassette transporters B1 gene (ABCB1), renders multidrug resistance (MDR) during cancer chemotherapy. Several synthetic small molecule inhibitors affect P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transport function in MDR tumor cells. However, inhibition of P-gp transport function adversely accumulates chemotherapeutic drugs in non-target normal tissues. Moreover, most small-molecule P-gp inhibitors failed in the clinical trials due to the low therapeutic window at the maximum tolerated dose. Therefore, downregulation of ABCB1-gene expression (P-gp) in tumor tissues seems to be a novel approach rather than inhibiting its transport function for the reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR). Several plant-derived phytochemicals modulate various signal transduction pathways and inhibit translocation of transcription factors, thereby reverses P-gp mediated MDR in tumor cells. Therefore, phytochemicals may be considered an alternative to synthetic small molecule P-gp inhibitors for the reversal of MDR in cancer cells. This review discussed the role of natural phytochemicals that modulate ABCB1 expression through various signal transduction pathways in MDR cancer cells. Therefore, modulating the cell signaling pathways by phytochemicals might play crucial roles in modulating ABCB1 gene expression and the reversal of MDR.",nocancer
"Hydrogen polysulfide (H2Sn, n > 1), a member of reactive sulfur species (RSS), is primarily generated during the crosstalk between H2S and reactive oxygen species (ROS), which plays important role in physiological and pathological processes. Ferroptosis is a new non-classical mode of cell death, in which ROS-associated lipid peroxidation and iron-dependent accumulation are the main features. However, the biological effects of H2Sn on ferroptosis and the detailed mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop highly selective and sensitive chemical tools for monitoring H2Sn in living cells. Herein, we develop a two-photon fluorescent probe (PSP) for specifically imaging H2Sn in live cells and tumor spheroids. This probe exhibited a sensitive and selective response to H2Sn, which had been used for imaging exogenous and endogenous H2Sn in living cells by confocal imaging and high content imaging. PSP exhibits excellent photo-stability and two-photon imaging performance when irradiating at 880 nm in 3D HeLa multicellular tumor spheroids. Importantly, our studies revealed that H2Sn levels were significantly up-regulated during ferroptosis. These excellent properties ensure that PSP is a promising two-photon probe for exploring the biological and pathological effects of H2Sn during ferroptosis.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess serum Tumor necrosis factor-like weak inducer of apoptosis (TWEAK) concentrations to determine whether changes in patients with schizophrenia could have etiopathogenetic importance. Since very little research has addressed the connection between the inflammatory marker TWEAK and schizophrenia, we wanted to examine alterations of TWEAK and investigate the possible correlation between clinical symptomatology and serum concentrations. METHODS: A total of 45 schizophrenia patients and 40 healthy controls were included in this study. The Positive Symptom Assessment scale and the Negative Symptom Assessment scale were administered to determine symptom severity. Venous blood samples were collected and serum TWEAK levels were measured. RESULTS: Serum TWEAK levels were significantly higher in the schizophrenia group than the control group, independently of potential confounders, including sex, age, body mass index and smoking status. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that TWEAK is elevated in schizophrenia patients, which could deepen our understanding of the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia.",nocancer
"Pain is a common symptom in cancer patients. It is subjective and difficult to communicate. It continues to be outsourced and often overlooked despite the existence of multiple recommendations. The objective of this study is to describe pain management in cancer patients in a Tunisian hospital. This is a prospective study, conducted over one month at the maternity centre of Monastir by an intern in pharmacy using a questionnaire. Of 128 patients assessed, 50 were algic. Twenty-six percent of algic patients were not treated. The neuropathic component of pain was present in 30 % of cases but under treatment. Relief opioids were prescribed in 43 % of cases to relieve pain. Paracetamol was prescribed in 26 % of cases. Ten percent of patients use paracetamol self-medication. Sixteen percent of patients have tried non-pharmacological means, of which 62 % consume plants. To optimise the management of pain at our centre, the available analgesic sheets have been developed, validated by the medical staff and disseminated in the departments of carcinology and oncohematology. Therapeutic education sessions were also scheduled to warn patients about the risks of self-medication and misuse of medicinal plants. Pain management is complex. It requires respect for international recommendations, but especially for the efforts made by all stakeholders.",nocancer
"The development of the supramolecular coordination complex with different shapes and dimensionalities lays the basis for its application in different areas. In this study, a porphyrin-based 3D organo-Pt(II) metallatriangle (MTA) was fabricated through the reported method termed as ""coordination driven self-assembly"". 31P NMR, 1H NMR, HR-MS, and theoretical calculation were employed to characterize the resultant MTA fully. Furthermore, the fabricated nanocomposite through coassembly of MTA and an amphiphilic polypeptide (PEG-PPT) could generate singlet oxygen (1O2) under the NIR irradiation and release a Pt drug under a low-pH microenvironment. 1O2 and the Pt drug can both damage the cancer cells, which improves the efficiency of cancer therapies. The fabrication of a Pt-porphyrin metallatriangle expands the topological structures, and the Pt-porphyrin metallatriangle can be applied to the combined cancer therapies. Moreover, various stimuli-responsive groups can be modified to the triangle, so a new method is created to develop high-performance biosupramolecular materials.",nocancer
"Pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) is widely utilised in cancer chemotherapy, but exhibits large inter-individual pharmacokinetic variability and sex differences in plasma clearance. Population pharmacokinetic modelling has suggested PLD plasma clearance correlates with peripheral monocyte counts, while sex hormones are known to affect endocytosis and phagocytosis in mononuclear cells. This study investigated whether sex hormones affect the uptake of PLD by human monocytes and macrophages in vitro. 17beta-estradiol, but not testosterone, inhibited the uptake of PLD in a concentration dependent manner in undifferentiated (but not differentiated) THP-1 cells, and primary monocytes obtained from women, but not men. Effects of estradiol were only evident at very high concentrations seen during pregnancy. No differences were observed in monocyte count or monocyte subtypes between males and females. These data show that monocytes do not contribute to sex differences seen in PLD clearance in humans of reproductive age.",nocancer
"The scientific interest in the beneficial properties of natural substances has been recognized for decades, as well as the growing attention in extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by different organisms, in particular from animal cells. However, there is increasing interest in the isolation and biological and functional characterization of these lipoproteic structures in the plant kingdom. Similar to animal vesicles, these plant-derived extracellular vesicles (PDEVs) exhibit a complex content of small RNAs, proteins, lipids, and other metabolites. This sophisticated composition enables PDEVs to be therapeutically attractive. In this review, we report and discuss current knowledge on PDEVs in terms of isolation, characterization of their content, biological properties, and potential use as drug delivery systems. In conclusion, we outline controversial issues on which the scientific community shall focus the attention shortly.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Fibrous dysplasia/McCune-Albright syndrome (FD/MAS) is a rare mosaic disorder of Galphas activation. Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF23)-mediated hypophosphatemia is a feature of FD/MAS that has been associated with poor skeletal outcomes. Standard therapy includes oral phosphorus and vitamin D analogs; however, treatment is limited by potential adverse renal and gastrointestinal effects. Burosumab is a monoclonal antibody to FGF23 approved to treat patients with X-linked hypophosphatemia and tumor-induced osteomalacia. There is currently no safety or efficacy data to support burosumab use in patients with FD/MAS. CASE DESCRIPTION: An 8-year-old boy with severe FD/MAS presented with persistent hypophosphatemia and skeletal complications despite conventional treatment with oral phosphate and calcitriol. He was started on burosumab and achieved sustained normalization of serum phosphorus and marked improvement in alkaline phosphatase levels. This was accompanied by an encouraging clinical response, including decreased bone pain, improved muscle strength, and improved ambulation. No adverse effects of burosumab therapy were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first reported case of burosumab treatment in a patient with FD/MAS. The encouraging biochemical and clinical response in this patient highlights the need for future studies to explore the safety and efficacy of burosumab in the FD/MAS pediatric population.",nocancer
"Nutraceuticals need special attention as preventive molecules to create a natural barrier against various dreadful diseases like cancer and to regulate metabolism. In the present study, two spices, Trachyspermum ammi and Cinnamomum verum, been identified as excellent Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (PTPases) sources that play significant role in the regulation of cell signal transduction and developmental processes in plants as well as animals, being lucrative and potential targets for pharmacological modulation. PTPases from both cases were partially purified into 0%-40% and 40%-80% fractions based on ammonium sulfate saturation levels. Fraction (40%-80%) exhibited a purification level of 4.44-fold and 2.86-fold with specific activity of 44.06 and 23.33 U/mg for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. PTPases being found to be thermally stable up to 70 C imply their industrial significance. Kinetic studies showed Km values to be 7.14 and 8.33 mM, whereas the activation energy (Ea ) values were 25.89 and 29.13 kJ/mol, respectively. Divalent cations: Cu2+ , Zn2+ , and Mn2+ acted as inhibitors of PTPases, from both sources. The Ki values of inhibitors varied from 0.014-0.125 mM in the descending order Cu2+  > Zn2+  > Mn2+ and Mn2+  > Cu2+  > Zn2+ for PTPases from T. ammi and C. verum, respectively. The inhibitory effect of sodium metavanadate aligns with prominent PTPase characteristics. In addition to these properties, the thermostability of PTPases from two spices enhances their significance in industries with therapeutically vital products. Although the source of PTPases is culinary spices, further studies are required to establish the utilization of PTPases as nutraceuticals and in therapeutic formulations. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: For a healthy lifestyle, awareness needs to be created by humankind towards food habits to minimize illnesses. Numerous studies have explored the consumption of nutraceutical products acts as a natural barrier and immune booster for various human ailments including SARS-COV-2. PTPases play important roles in regulating intracellular signaling and, ultimately, biological function along with their structural features. The importance of PTPases and their inhibitors has been implicated in various diseases like cancer, diabetes, and obesity. Further investigations need to be undertaken to explore the therapeutic properties of PTPases in both in vivo and in vitro for their clinical significance.",nocancer
"AIM: Research has proven a link between oral health and numerous chronic systemic diseases. To achieve better health outcomes, there is a need to involve interprofessional primary health care providers, such as nurses to raise awareness and promote oral health. Nurses have regular contact with patients which provides a unique opportunity to impart disease-specific information and technical skills for patients to self-manage their oral health conditions. However, the baseline oral health literacy of undergraduate nursing students at the University of Sydney is not known. Before creating a targeted curriculum to improve oral health literacy amongst nursing students, it is essential to assess the baseline oral health knowledge of these students. This study aimed to assess the oral health literacy level among undergraduate nursing students of the University of Sydney, Australia. DESIGN: An exploratory research approach was used. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted using the validated Comprehensive Measure of Oral Health Knowledge (CMOHK) instrument. A univariate general linear model was used to explore the association of CMOHK total score with demographic and educational variables. RESULTS: A total number of 197 nursing students participated in the survey, with a mean CMOHK score of 15.48, SD 3.27. 72% were categorized as having good, 16% fair and 12% poor oral health knowledge. The analysis from the six individual knowledge domains of the CMOHK revealed lower percentages of correct responses in the periodontal disease and oral cancer knowledge domains. Students with English as their second language, on average, scored 2 fewer correct responses (p <.001) than students whose first language was English. Low socioeconomic status was not associated with a low level of oral health literacy. CONCLUSION: The baseline results show a good level of general oral health knowledge as measured by the CMOHK. However, periodontal disease and oral cancer were identified as the particular domains where a knowledge gap exists. These findings may help to map and design an oral health education intervention to improve oral health literacy amongst nursing students. Culturally responsive pedagogy may need to be considered for students with English as their second language. This baseline survey data may potentially facilitate integrating oral health in nursing education and practice.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVE: Oral mucositis (OM), the most common side effect of cancer therapy, is associated with pro-inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) increased expression. Although there are approaches for OM management, none is infallible, thus, elucidation of molecular events related to OM etiopathogenesis may improve current therapeutic strategies. This study assessed the influence of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemotherapy drugs on MMPs expression and synthesis by oral mucosa cells. DESIGN: Human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) were exposed to different concentrations of methotrexate (MTX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); subsequentially, cell viability, nitric oxide and interleukin(IL)-6 production were evaluated to select the concentration of these drugs that could stimulate inflammatory phenotype without cytotoxic effects. Then, HGF and primary gingival keratinocytes (PGK) were subjected to different stimuli: culture medium (negative control), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha - positive control), IL-6, IL-8, MTX, and 5-FU for 3, 6, 12, and 24 h. Next, gene expression and synthesis of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by HGF and MMP-3 by PGK were assessed. RESULTS: At 6 h, MMP-2 synthesis increased 60 % after exposure to TNF-alpha and MTX, 40 % after IL-6, and 15 % after IL-8. At 12 h, MMP-9 synthesis increased 15 % after exposure to TNF-alpha, while MMP-3 synthesis increased 30 % after TNF-alpha, and 10 % after IL-8. TNF-alpha-treated groups presented increased gene expression of all MMPs evaluated. IL-8 and 5-FU increased MMP-2 and MMP-3 expression, while IL-6 and MTX augmented MMP-2 expression. CONCLUSIONS: The chemotherapy drugs and cytokines investigated up-regulated MMPs expression by oral mucosa cells, which may lead to OM establishment and severity.",nocancer
"It is well established that collagen alignment in the breast tumor microenvironment provides biophysical cues to drive disease progression. Numerous mechanistic studies have demonstrated that tumor cell behavior is driven by the architecture and stiffness of the collagen matrix. However, the mechanical properties within a 3D collagen microenvironment, particularly at the scale of the cell, remain poorly defined. To investigate cell-scale mechanical cues with respect to local collagen architecture, we employed a combination of intravital imaging of the mammary tumor microenvironment and a 3D collagen gel system with both acellular pNIPAAm microspheres and MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells. Within the in vivo tumor microenvironment, the displacement of collagen fiber was identified in response to tumor cells migrating through the stromal matrix. To further investigate cell-scale stiffness in aligned fiber architectures and the propagation of cell-induced fiber deformations, precise control of collagen architecture was coupled with innovative methodology to measure mechanical properties of the collagen fiber network. This method revealed up to a 35-fold difference in directional cell-scale stiffness resulting from contraction against aligned fibers. Furthermore, the local anisotropy of the matrix dramatically altered the rate at which contractility-induced fiber displacements decayed over distance. Together, our results reveal mechanical properties in aligned matrices that provide dramatically different cues to the cell in perpendicular directions. These findings are supported by the mechanosensing behavior of tumor cells and have important implications for cell-cell communication within the tissue microenvironment.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND/AIM: This study was designed to investigate the effect of IL-39 on T24 bladder cancer (BC) cell line survival and growth. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to assess the direct effect of IL-39 on survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of T24 BC cells, we utilized a clonogenic survival assay, a cell proliferation assay, and caspase-3 activity kits. Potential proliferative and apoptotic molecular mechanisms were evaluated by RT-PCR. RESULTS: Treatment of T24 BC cells with IL-39 resulted in a significant reduction in the percentage of colonies. The anti-tumor effect of IL-39 on T24 bladder cancer cells correlated strongly with a decrease in cyclin E, in combination with an increase in the mRNA levels of Fas. CONCLUSION: IL-39 impedes the growth and survival of T24 BC cells by inhibiting growth and promoting apoptosis. This ability to modulate gene transcription in neoplastic cells shows promise and warrants further research in immunotherapy.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Our objective is to evaluate the safety of deep sedation with Propofol administered by endoscopists or trained nurses . MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective study conducted in all patients undergoing colonoscopy for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, sedated with Propofol controlled by the endoscopy team (ET) during a period of 8 months. Different variables were recorded: sex, anesthetic risk (ASA), dose of Propofol, duration of the exploration and presence of desaturation, bradycardia or hypotension. RESULTS: 277 colonoscopies were performed (53.4% male), with 25 (8.9%) complications related to sedation. The most frequent were cardiovascular complications (21 cases, 84%), including 15 cases of hypotension, 3 cases of bradycardia, and 3 of both at the same time. Four (1.4%) desaturations were recorded. In these cases, the mean dose of propofol (251mg), as well as the time of exploration (36+-8 min) and the ASA classification were higher than in those patients without complications, or with cardiovascular events (no statistically significant difference). DISCUSSION: Deep sedation with propofol controlled by traide ET in our screening colonoscopy program is a safe procedure. .",nocancer
"Background: Childhood cancer survivors (Ccs) are at risk for cognitive late-effects, which might result from cortical alterations, even if cancer does not affect the brain. The study aimed to examine gray and white matter volume and its relationship to cognition. Methods: Forty-three Ccs of non-central nervous system cancers and 43 healthy controls, aged 7-16 years, were examined. Cognitive functions and fine motor coordination were assessed and T1-weighted images were collected for voxel-based morphometry. Results: Executive functions (p = .024, d = .31) were poorer in Ccs than controls, however still within the normal range. The volume of the amygdala (p = .011, n2 = .117) and the striatum (p = .03, n2 = .102) was reduced in Ccs. No significant structure-function correlations were found, neither in patients nor controls. Conclusion: Non-CNS childhood cancer and its treatment impacts on brain structures relevant to emotion processing.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of hip osteoarthritis increases, the number of total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures performed is also projected to increase. Accurately risk-stratifying patients who undergo THA would be of great utility, given the significant cost and morbidity associated with developing perioperative complications. We aim to develop a novel machine learning (ML)-based ensemble algorithm for the prediction of major complications after THA, as well as compare its performance against standard benchmark ML methods. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of 89,986 adults who underwent primary THA at any California-licensed hospital between 2015 and 2017. The primary outcome was major complications (eg infection, venous thromboembolism, cardiac complication, pulmonary complication). We developed a model predicting complication risk using AutoPrognosis, an automated ML framework that configures the optimally performing ensemble of ML-based prognostic models. We compared our model with logistic regression and standard benchmark ML models, assessing discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: There were 545 patients who had major complications (0.61%). Our novel algorithm was well-calibrated and improved risk prediction compared to logistic regression, as well as outperformed the other four standard benchmark ML algorithms. The variables most important for AutoPrognosis (eg malnutrition, dementia, cancer) differ from those that are most important for logistic regression (eg chronic atherosclerosis, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). CONCLUSION: We report a novel ensemble ML algorithm for the prediction of major complications after THA. It demonstrates superior risk prediction compared to logistic regression and other standard ML benchmark algorithms. By providing accurate prognostic information, this algorithm may facilitate more informed preoperative shared decision-making.",nocancer
"Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that is essential for bone mineral metabolism and it has several other effects in the body, including anti-cancer actions. Vitamin D causes a reduction in cell growth by interrupting the cell cycle. Moreover, the active form of vitamin D, i.e., 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, exerts various effects via its interaction with the vitamin D receptor on the innate and adaptive immune system, which could be relevant in the onset of tumors. Multiple myeloma is a treatable but incurable malignancy characterized by the growth of clonal plasma cells in protective niches in the bone marrow. In patients affected by multiple myeloma, vitamin D deficiency is commonly correlated with an advanced stage of the disease, greater risk of progression, the development of pathological fractures, and a worse prognosis. Changes in the vitamin D receptor often contribute to the occurrence and progress of deficiencies, which can be overcome by supplementation with vitamin D or analogues. However, in spite of the findings available in the literature, there is no clear standard of care and clinical practice varies. Further research is needed to better understand how vitamin D influences outcomes in patients with monoclonal gammopathies.",nocancer
"Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] A, B, and C) may affect susceptibility to many diseases such as cancer, auto-immune or infectious diseases. Individual genetic variation may help to explain different immune responses to microorganisms across a population. HLA typing can be fast and inexpensive; however, deciphering peptides loaded on MHC-I and II which are presented to T cells, require the design and development of high-sensitivity methodological approaches and subsequently databases. Hence, these novel strategies and databases could help in the generation of vaccines using these potential immunogenic peptides and in identifying high-risk HLA types to be prioritized for vaccination programs. Herein, the recent developments and approaches, in this field, focusing on the identification of immunogenic peptides have been reviewed and the next steps to promote their translation into biomedical and clinical practice are discussed.",nocancer
"Along with the aging of the world population, the incidence rate of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been increasing. At present, AD has become one of the most serious problems faced by modern medicine. Studies have shown that estrogen has a positive effect on AD, but estrogen has the side effect of leading to tumors. Recent in vivo studies have shown that genistein, one of the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), can improve brain function through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), antagonize the toxicity of amyloid beta-protein (Abeta), that is, to inhibit neurotoxicity due to aggregation of beta amyloid protein, and have neuroprotective effects. In addition, the use of Gen can avoid the risk of endometrial cancer and breast cancer caused by estrogen therapy while exerting an estrogen-like effect, which has some potential for the delay and treatment of AD.",nocancer
"Obesity is a risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer. Obesity-related inflammation upregulates aromatase expression, the rate-limiting enzyme for estrogen synthesis, in breast adipose tissue (BAT), increasing estrogen production and cancer risk. The regulation of aromatase gene (CYP19A1) in BAT is complex, and the mechanisms linking obesity and aromatase dysregulation are not fully understood. An obesity-associated factor that could regulate aromatase is the CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 2, a pro-inflammatory factor that also activates signaling pathways implicated in CYP19A1 transcription. By using human primary breast adipose stromal cells (ASCs) and aromatase reporter (hARO-Luc) mouse mammary adipose explants, we demonstrated that CCL2 enhances the glucocorticoid-mediated CYP19A1 transcription. The potential mechanism involves the activation of PI.4 via ERK1/2 pathway. We also showed that CCL2 contributes to the pro-inflammatory milieu and aromatase expression in obesity, evidenced by increased expression of CCL2 and CYP19A1 in mammary tissues from obese hARO-Luc mice, and subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese women. In summary, our results indicate that postmenopausal obesity may promote CCL2 production in BAT, leading to exacerbation of the menopause-related inflammatory state and further stimulation of local aromatase and estrogens. These results provide new insights into the regulation of aromatase and may aid in finding approaches to prevent breast cancer.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: Animal assisted interventions (AAI) have been used in different contexts including oncology/palliative care and can improve mood, quality of life and wellness. The goal of this review was to evaluate studies about AAI and its effects on oncological/palliative care patients. METHODS: The search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus and Lilacs databases. The inclusion criteria were original articles that measured quantitatively the health-related outcomes of an AAI on oncological/palliative care patients. RESULTS: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Benefits related to the AAI were described. Mood, pain perception and quality of life seemed to be the variables that had improvement with the intervention. Due to the small sample sizes/heterogeneous methodologies, additional analyses could not be performed. CONCLUSIONS: AAI can be an important tool for improving psychosocial/physiological parameters in cancer/palliative care patients. Further well designed studies are needed to provide a better knowledge of the AAI benefits in this setting.",nocancer
"Amalgamation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive stimulus with nanoparticles has gained considerable interest owing to their high tumor specificity. Hypoxia plays a pivotal role in the acceleration of intracellular ROS production. Herein, we report the construction of a cancer cell (PD-L1)- and ROS-responsive, dual-targeted, temozolomide (TMZ)-laden nanosystem which offers a better anticancer effect in a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. A dual-targeted system boosted permeation in the cancer cells. Hypoxic conditions elevating the high ROS level accelerated the in situ release of TMZ from anti-PD-L1-TKNPs. Hyperaccumulated ROS engendered from TMZ caused oxidative damage leading to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. TMZ fabricated in the multifunctional nanosystem (anti-PD-L1-TMZ-TKNPs) provided excellent tumor accumulation and retarded tumor growth under in vivo conditions. The elevated apoptosis effect with the activation of an apoptotic marker, DNA double-strand breakage marker, and downregulation of the angiogenesis marker in the tumor tissue following treatment with anti-PD-L1-TMZ-TKNPs exerts robust anticancer effect. Collectively, the nanoconstruct offers deep tumor permeation and high drug release and broadens the application of the ROS-responsive nanosystem for a successful anticancer effect.",nocancer
"Context: Autologous bone is the most commonly used flap in cranioplasty to repair the defect; however, synthetic materials are available. Poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) is an effective polymer owing to its thermoplastic and radiolucent properties comparable to bone strength. Three-dimensional (3D) printing combined with computer-assisted design (CAD) is a simple, low-cost method to print molds that ensure surgical success. Materials and Methods: A total of 114 patients underwent cranioplasty (July 2015-April 2018), and 25 of them using 3D printed template molds due to unavailability of autologous bone. The clinical features, patient demographics, and surgical parameters were analyzed. The visual analog score for cosmesis (VASC) and Odom's score was obtained pre and post-op. Results: The mean age of the patients is 38.4 +- 14.6 years (Range, 9-66). The primary pathology for undergoing craniectomy is stroke (n = 13; 52%), traumatic brain injury (10; 40%) and tumor (2; 8%). The reason for nonavailability of flap was infection (n = 14;56%), flap resorption (4;16%), and trauma or tumor (7;28%). The mean time for manufacturing the 3D printed template is 13.2 +- 2.1 h. On follow-up, median Odom's score is excellent in 52% of cases, good in 40%, and fair in 8%. The mean VASC score on follow up is 8.2 +- 1.3. Three patients developed minor postoperative complications. Conclusion: This is the first study from a single tertiary care center in India to systematically evaluate the outcomes in 3D cranioplasty using CAD and 3D printing technology. This method would be optimal especially in developing countries since PMMA is cost effective and also gives an ideal cosmetic effect.",nocancer
"Objectives: As part of a pragmatic effectiveness trial of integrative pain management among inpatients with cancer, the authors sought to understand the clinical context and adaptations to implementation of two study interventions, acupuncture and pain counseling (i.e., pain education and coping skills). Design: The larger study uses a 2 x 2 factorial design with inpatients randomized to: (1) usual care (UC), (2) UC with acupuncture, (3) UC with pain counseling, and (4) UC with acupuncture and pain counseling. The study is being conducted in two hospitals (one academic and one public) and three languages (Cantonese, English, and Spanish). The authors conducted a process evaluation by interviewing study interventionists. Analysis included deductive coding to describe context, intervention, implementation, and inductive thematic coding related to intervention delivery. Results: Interviewees included seven acupuncturists and four pain counselors. Qualitative themes covered adaptations and recognizing site-specific differences that affected implementation. Interventionists adhered closely to protocols and made patient-centered adaptations that were then standardized in broader implementation (e.g., including caregivers in pain counseling sessions; working in culturally nuanced ways with non-English-speaking patients). The public hospital included more patients with recent diagnoses and advanced disease, more ethnically and linguistically diverse patients, less continuity of staffing, and shared patient rooms. At the academic medical center, more patients were familiar with integrative therapies and all were located in single rooms. Providing acupuncture to hospital staff was a key strategy to establish trust, experientially explain the intervention, and create camaraderie and staff buy-in. Conclusions: Providing nonpharmacologic interventions for a pragmatic trial requires adapting to a range of clinical factors. Site-specific factors included greater coordination and resources needed for successful implementation in the public hospital. The authors conclude that adaptation to context and individual patient needs can be done without compromising intervention fidelity and that intervention design should apply principles such as centering at the margins to reduce participation barriers for diverse patient populations.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Tobacco consumption in smoking and non-smoking forms have been consequential in the rise of oral cancer cases. Among different forms, epidemiological studies from Middle Eastern countries and rural parts of northern India have reported increasing association of oral cancer with waterpipe (hookah) smoking. However, molecular mechanisms and role played by waterpipe smoking in the onset of oral carcinogenesis remains unexplored. METHODS: In this study, immortalized normal human oral keratinocytes were chronically treated with extracts of two varieties of waterpipe tobacco - crude tobacco and processed shisha. Phenotypic changes and molecular aberrations were examined using cell culture-based assays and mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomic analysis, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis was utilized to analyze proteomics data and identify dysregulated pathways. RESULTS: Our data indicates that chronic treatment with waterpipe tobacco extracts increased proliferation, invasion, migration, and significant dysregulation of protein expression in oral keratinocytes. Altered expression of proteins involved in interferon signaling pathway were observed with both varieties of tobacco. Overexpression of cholesterol metabolism and vesicle-mediated transport proteins were identified exclusively in cells treated with crude tobacco extract. Bioinformatics analyses revealed different oncogenic response in oral cells based on the type of waterpipe tobacco used. CONCLUSIONS: This study may serve as a useful resource in understanding the early onset of oral cancer attributed to waterpipe smoking.",nocancer
"Detection of cellular microRNA biomarkers is an emerging powerful tool in cancer diagnostics. Currently, it requires multistep tedious protocols based on molecular amplification of the RNA target, e.g. RT-qPCR. Here, we developed a one-step enzyme-free method for microRNA detection in cellular extracts based on light-harvesting nanoparticle (nanoantenna) biosensors. They amplify the fluorescence signal by effective Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from ultrabright dye-loaded polymeric nanoparticle to a single acceptor and thus convert recognition of one microRNA copy (through nucleic acid strand displacement) into a response of >400 dyes. The developed nanoprobes of 17-19 nm diameter for four microRNAs (miR-21, let-7f, miR-222 and miR-30a) exhibit outstanding brightness (up to 3.8 x 107 M-1cm-1) and ratiometric sequence-specific response to microRNA with the limit of detection (LOD) down to 1.3 pM (21 amol), equivalent to 24 RT-qPCR cycles. They enable quantitative detection of the four microRNAs in RNA extracts from five cancerous cell lines (human breast cancer - T47D and MCF7, head and neck cancer - CAL33 and glioblastoma - LNZ308 and U373) and two non-cancerous ones (Hek293 and MCF10A), in agreement with RT-qPCR. The results confirmed that let-7f and especially miR-21 are systematically overexpressed in all studied cancerous cell lines. These nanoparticle biosensors are compatible with low-cost portable fluorometers and small detection volumes (11 amol LOD), opening a route to rapid point-of-care cancer diagnostics.",nocancer
"Defining the principles of T cell migration in structurally and mechanically complex tumor microenvironments is critical to understanding escape from antitumor immunity and optimizing T cell-related therapeutic strategies. Here, we engineered nanotextured elastic platforms to study and enhance T cell migration through complex microenvironments and define how the balance between contractility localization-dependent T cell phenotypes influences migration in response to tumor-mimetic structural and mechanical cues. Using these platforms, we characterize a mechanical optimum for migration that can be perturbed by manipulating an axis between microtubule stability and force generation. In 3D environments and live tumors, we demonstrate that microtubule instability, leading to increased Rho pathway-dependent cortical contractility, promotes migration whereas clinically used microtubule-stabilizing chemotherapies profoundly decrease effective migration. We show that rational manipulation of the microtubule-contractility axis, either pharmacologically or through genome engineering, results in engineered T cells that more effectively move through and interrogate 3D matrix and tumor volumes. Thus, engineering cells to better navigate through 3D microenvironments could be part of an effective strategy to enhance efficacy of immune therapeutics.",nocancer

"A series of novel artemisinin ester derivatives were designed and synthesized for targeting mitochondria. Cytotoxicity against SMMC-7721, HepG2, OVCAR3, A549 and J82 cancer cell lines was evaluated. Compound 2c (IC50 = 3.0 muM) was the most potent anti-proliferative molecule against the OVCAR3 cells with low cytotoxicity in normal HUVEC cells. The mechanism of action of compound 2c was further investigated by analyzing cell apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and intracellular ROS generation. The results indicated that compound 2c targeted mitochondria and induced cell apoptosis. ROS and heme attributed to the cytotoxicity and cell apoptosis of compound 2c. These promising findings indicated the compound 2c could serve as a great candidate against ovarian cancer for further investigation.",nocancer
"S100B is a calcium-binding protein mainly expressed by astrocytes, but also localized in other definite neural and extra-neural cell types. While its presence in biological fluids is widely recognized as a reliable biomarker of active injury, growing evidence now indicates that high levels of S100B are suggestive of pathogenic processes in different neural, but also extra-neural, disorders. Indeed, modulation of S100B levels correlates with the occurrence of clinical and/or toxic parameters in experimental models of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, acute neural injury, inflammatory bowel disease, uveal and retinal disorders, obesity, diabetes and cancer, thus directly linking the levels of S100B to pathogenic mechanisms. In general, deletion/inactivation of the protein causes the improvement of the disease, whereas its over-expression/administration induces a worse clinical presentation. This scenario reasonably proposes S100B as a common therapeutic target for several different disorders, also offering new clues to individuate possible unexpected connections among these diseases.",nocancer
"Objective: To investigate the clinicpathological characteristics of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) in transplanted lung, and to improve its diagnosis and treatment. Methods: The clinicopathological characteristics of PTLD in three transplanted lungs were evaluated at Wuxi People's Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from 2014 to 2019. HE, immunohistochemical staining and in situ hybridization were performed. The relevant literature of PTLD was reviewed. Results: All three patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) before lung transplantation. After receiving both lung transplants, they were all treated with anti-rejection drugs tacrolimus or mycophenolate mofetil, and combined with antiviral and/or rituximab. The time from transplantation to diagnosis of PTLD was four years, seven months, and five months, respectively. Two patients died one month and five months after initial diagnosis, and one patient was alive with no disease after one year. Histologically, all cases were monomorphic B-cell PTLD (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, unspecified), and the tumor cells were positive for Epstein-Barr virus by in situ hybridization; one of the late-onset patients had herpes simplex virus infection. Conclusions: PTLD in the post-transplant lung tissue shows unique morphology and clinical characteristics, and is closely related to Epstein-Barr virus infection. Patients who receive lung transplantation due to COPD are more susceptible to develop PTLD, while late-onset ones occur more commonly in the hilum of lungs, and the prognosis is relatively poor.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare neoplastic tumor type of intermediate biological potential, only recently distinguished from the non-neoplastic category of inflammatory pseudotumor (IP). The literature describes very few cases of IMTs arising in the central nervous system (CNS), and the distinguishing clinical, pathological, and molecular features of IMT-CNS are not well understood. Our purpose is to publish a case of an IMT-CNS with a novel DCTN1-ALK gene fusion, furthering in the literature's characterization of a rare tumor type. METHODS: Review of the literature included a PubMed Database search of articles found by the following searches: ""Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor;"" ""Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor central nervous system;"" ""ALK gene fusion;"" and ""DCTN1-ALK gene fusion."" Inclusion of articles discovered by these search terms was determined through critical appraisal of article relevance, number of citations, cross-citation within articles of interest, and rare findings with conflicting conclusions in an effort to reduce publication bias. RESULTS: We present a case of IMT-CNS with several distinctive molecular features including a DCTN1-ALK gene fusion, the first of its kind described in an intracranial IMT. CONCLUSION: IMT is an infrequent tumor type and its presentation within the CNS is exceedingly rare. The paucity of cases, along with the ambiguity of terminology in the literature, has stunted accurate clinical, pathological, and molecular characterization of IMT-CNS. Our case report improves the characterization of the recently appreciated category of IMT-CNS so that connections between phenotype and prognosis, and between genotype and treatment, can eventually be made.",nocancer
"Deep learning based generative adversarial networks (GAN) can effectively perform image reconstruction with under-sampled MR data. In general, a large number of training samples are required to improve the reconstruction performance of a certain model. However, in real clinical applications, it is difficult to obtain tens of thousands of raw patient data to train the model since saving k-space data is not in the routine clinical flow. Therefore, enhancing the generalizability of a network based on small samples is urgently needed. In this study, three novel applications were explored based on parallel imaging combined with the GAN model (PI-GAN) and transfer learning. The model was pre-trained with public Calgary brain images and then fine-tuned for use in (1) patients with tumors in our center; (2) different anatomies, including knee and liver; (3) different k-space sampling masks with acceleration factors (AFs) of 2 and 6. As for the brain tumor dataset, the transfer learning results could remove the artifacts found in PI-GAN and yield smoother brain edges. The transfer learning results for the knee and liver were superior to those of the PI-GAN model trained with its own dataset using a smaller number of training cases. However, the learning procedure converged more slowly in the knee datasets compared to the learning in the brain tumor datasets. The reconstruction performance was improved by transfer learning both in the models with AFs of 2 and 6. Of these two models, the one with AF = 2 showed better results. The results also showed that transfer learning with the pre-trained model could solve the problem of inconsistency between the training and test datasets and facilitate generalization to unseen data.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The use of psychedelic treatments has shown very promising results in some psychiatric and addictive disorders, but not all patients achieved a response. AIM: The aim of this review is to explore the clinical and biological factors which could predict the response to psychedelics in psychiatric and addictive disorders. METHODS: A systematic research was performed on MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Web of science, and Scopus databases from January 1990 to May 2020. All studies investigating the predictive factors of response to psychedelics regardless of psychiatric or addictive disorders, were included. RESULTS: Twenty studies investigating addictive disorder, treatment-resistant depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with life-threatening cancer were included in this review. We found that, in all indications, the main predictive factor of response to psychedelics is the intensity of the acute psychedelic experience. Indeed, we found this factor for alcohol and tobacco use disorders, treatment-resistant depression, and anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients with life-threatening cancer, but not for obsessive-compulsive disorder. CONCLUSION: The intensity of the acute psychedelic experience was the main predicting factor of response. The action mechanism of this experience was not clear, but some hypotheses could be made, such as a modulation of serotoninergic system by 5-HT2A receptors agonism, a modulation of the default mode network (DMN) with an acute modular disintegration of the DMN followed by a re-integration of this network with a normal functioning, or an anti-inflammatory effect of this treatment.",nocancer
"INTRODUCTION: This study protocol outlines the evaluation of the pictorial support in person-centred care for children (PicPecc). PicPecc is a digital tool used by children aged 5-17 years to self-report symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, who undergo high-dose methotrexate treatments. The design of the digital platform follows the principles of universal design using pictorial support to provide accessibility for all children regardless of communication or language challenges and thus facilitating international comparison. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Both effect and process evaluations will be conducted. A crossover design will be used to measure the effect/outcome, and a mixed-methods design will be used to measure the process/implementation. The primary outcome in the effect evaluation will be self-reported distress. Secondary outcomes will be stress levels monitored via neuropeptides, neurosteroids and peripheral steroids indicated in plasma blood samples; frequency of in-app estimation of high levels of distress by the children; children's use of analgesic medicine and person centeredness evaluated via the questionnaire Visual CARE Measure. For the process evaluation, qualitative interviews will be carried out with children with cancer, their legal guardians and case-related healthcare professionals. These interviews will address experiences with PicPecc in terms of feasibility and frequency of use from the child's perspective and value to the caseworker. Interview transcripts will be analysed using an interpretive description methodology. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from the Swedish Ethical Review Authority (reference 2019-02392; 2020-02601; 2020-06226). Children, legal guardians, healthcare professionals, policymaking and research stakeholders will be involved in all stages of the research process according to Medical Research Council's guidelines. Research findings will be presented at international cancer and paediatric conferences and published in scientific journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT04433650.",nocancer
"Cellular pyruvate is an essential metabolite at the crossroads of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, capable of supporting fermentative glycolysis by reduction to lactate mediated by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) among other functions. Several inherited diseases of mitochondrial metabolism impact extracellular (plasma) pyruvate concentrations, and [1-13C]pyruvate infusion is used in isotope-labeled metabolic tracing studies, including hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). However, how these extracellular pyruvate sources impact intracellular metabolism is not clear. Herein, we examined the effects of excess exogenous pyruvate on intracellular LDH activity, extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) as a measure of lactate production, and hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate-to-[1-13C]lactate conversion rates across a panel of tumor and normal cells. Combined LDH activity and LDHB/LDHA expression analysis intimated various hetero-tetrameric isoforms comprised of LDHA and LDHB in tumor cells, not only canonical LDHA. Millimolar concentrations of exogenous pyruvate induced substrate inhibition of LDH activity in both enzymatic assays ex vivo and in live cells, abrogated glycolytic ECAR, and inhibited hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate-to-[1-13C]lactate conversion rates in cellulo. Importantly, the extent of exogenous pyruvate-induced inhibition of LDH and glycolytic ECAR in live cells was highly dependent on pyruvate influx, functionally mediated by monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT1) localized to the plasma membrane. These data provided evidence that highly concentrated bolus injections of pyruvate in vivo may transiently inhibit LDH activity in a tissue type- and MCT1-dependent manner. Maintaining plasma pyruvate at submillimolar concentrations could potentially minimize transient metabolic perturbations, improve pyruvate therapy, and enhance quantification of metabolic studies, including hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRSI and stable isotope tracer experiments.",nocancer
"The oxygen in the benzofuran (BF) of three antiproliferative natural neolignans, salvinal (1), obovaten (2), and 2-[7-methoxy-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-methylbenzofuran-5-yl]ethanol (3), was replaced with sulfur to form the new biological scaffold benzothiophene (BT) thio-lignans 4-6. Compounds 1-6 and 18 synthesized derivatives were evaluated for antiproliferative activity against five human cancer cell lines, including a multidrug-resistant cell line. Thio-salvinal (4) displayed significant antiproliferative effects with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.57-0.95 muM against all tested cell lines, except for the HER2 negative breast cancer cell line MCF-7. This thio-lignan was 6.5-9.4 times more potent than parent 1. However, the related thio-lignans, 5 and 6, showed much weaker antiproliferative effects than 4 and were less potent than the parent natural benzofuran lignans 2 and 3. Newly synthesized thio-lignan 33 affected cell cycle progression at 24 and 48 h in the G2/M transition and S phase, respectively, as well as promoted sub-G1 induction by stimulating microtubule depolymerization and nuclear fragmentation. Since a highly reactive aldehyde in salvinal is generally not appropriate for drug development, we have successfully found nonaldehyde derivative 33 showing biological activity similar to salvinal by replacing BF with BT and an aldehyde with 1,3-dioxolane.",nocancer
"Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), a non-enveloped plant virus, and empty CPMV (eCPMV), a virus-like particle (VLP) composed of CPMV capsid without nucleic acids, are potent in situ cancer vaccines when administered intratumorally (I.T.). However, it is unclear how immune cells recognize these nanoparticles and why they are immunogenic, which was investigated in this study. CPMV generated stronger selective induction of cytokines and chemokines in naive mouse splenocytes and exhibited more potent anti-tumor efficacy than eCPMV. MyD88 is required for both CPMV- and eCPMV-elicited immune responses. Screening with human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cell toll-like receptor (TLR) reporter assays along with experiments in corresponding TLR-/- mice indicated CPMV and eCPMV capsids are recognized by MyD88-dependent TLR2 and TLR4. CPMV, but not eCPMV, is additionally recognized by TLR7. Secretion of type I interferons (IFNs), which requires the interaction between TLR7 and encapsulated single-stranded RNAs (ssRNAs), is critical to CPMV's better efficacy. The same recognition mechanisms are also functional in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Overall, these findings link CPMV immunotherapy efficacy with molecular recognition, provide rationale for how to develop more potent viral particles, accentuate the value of multi-TLR agonists as in situ cancer vaccines, and highlight the functional importance of type I IFNs for in situ vaccination.",nocancer
"Most cancers contain abundant tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs usually display a tumor-supportive M2-like phenotype; they promote tumor growth and influence lymphocyte infiltration, leading to immunosuppression. These properties have made TAMs an attractive cancer immunotherapy target. One promising immunotherapeutic strategy involves switching the tumor-promoting immune suppressive microenvironment by reprogramming TAMs. However, clinical trials of M2-like macrophage reprogramming have yielded unsatisfactory results due to their low efficacy and nonselective effects. In this article, we describe the development of M2-like macrophage-targeting nanoparticles (PNP@R@M-T) that efficiently and selectively deliver drugs to 58% of M2-like macrophages, over 39% of M1-like macrophages, and 32% of dendritic cells within 24 h in vivo. Compared with the control groups, administration of PNP@R@M-T dramatically reprogrammed the M2-like macrophages (51%), reduced tumor size (82%), and prolonged survival. Our findings indicate that PNP@R@M-T nanoparticles provide an effective and selective reprogramming strategy for macrophage-mediated cancer immunotherapy.",nocancer
"While administration of Hypertonic Saline (HSS) in combination with diuretics has yielded improved weight loss, preservation of renal function, and reduction in hospitalization time in the clinical setting of patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), the mechanisms that underlie these beneficial effects remain unclear and additional studies are needed before this approach can be adopted on a more consistent basis. As high salt conditions stimulate production of several renal autacoids that exhibit natriuretic effects, renal physiologists can contribute to the understanding of mechanisms by which HSS leads to increased diuresis both as an individual therapy, as well as in combination with loop diuretics. For instance, since HSS increases TNF-alpha production by proximal tubule (PT) and thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TAL) epithelial cells, this 'Perspective article' is aimed at highlighting how the effects of TNF-alpha produced by these cell types may contribute to the beneficial effects of HSS in patients with ADHF. While TNF-alpha produced by infiltrating macrophages and T cells exacerbate and attenuate renal damage, respectively, production of this cytokine within the tubular compartment of the kidney functions as an intrinsic regulator of blood pressure and sodium homeostasis via mechanisms along the nephron related to inhibition of NKCC2 activity and angiotensinogen (AGT) expression. Thus, in the clinical setting of ADHF and hyponatremia, induction of TNF-alpha production along the nephron by administration of HSS may attenuate NKCC2 activity and AGT expression as part of a mechanism that prevents excessive Na+ reabsorption in the TAL, thereby mitigating volume overload.",nocancer
"Arsenic (As) causes cancer and non-cancer health effects in humans. Previous research revealed As concentrations over 200 mug g-1 in lake sediments in the south-central Puget Sound region affected by the former ASARCO copper smelter in Ruston, WA, and significant bioaccumulation of As in plankton in shallow lakes. Enhanced uptake occurs during summertime stratification and near-bottom anoxia when As is mobilized from sediments. Periodic mixing events in shallow lakes allow dissolved As to mix into oxygenated waters and littoral zones where biota reside. We quantify As concentrations and associated health risks in human-consumed tissues of sunfish [pumpkinseed (Lepomis gibbosus) and bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus)], crayfish [signal (Pacifastacus leniusculus) and red swamp (Procambarus clarkii)], and snails [Chinese mystery (Bellamya chinensis)] from lakes representing a gradient of As contamination and differing mixing regimes. In three shallow lakes with a range of arsenic in profundal sediments (20 to 206 mug As g-1), mean arsenic concentrations ranged from 2.9 to 46.4 mug g-1 in snails, 2.6 to 13.9 mug g-1 in crayfish, and 0.07 to 0.61 mug g-1 in sunfish. Comparatively, organisms in the deep, contaminated lake (208 mug g-1 in profundal sediments) averaged 11.8 mug g-1 in snails and 0.06 mug g-1 in sunfish. Using inorganic As concentrations, we calculated that consuming aquatic species from the most As-contaminated shallow lake resulted in 4-10 times greater health risks compared to the deep lake with the same arsenic concentrations in profundal sediments. We show that dynamics in shallow, polymictic lakes can result in greater As bioavailability compared to deeper, seasonally stratified lakes. Arsenic in oxygenated waters and littoral sediments was more indicative of exposure to aquatic species than profundal sediments, and therefore we recommend that sampling methods focus on these shallow zones to better indicate the potential for uptake into organisms and human health risk.",nocancer
"Precise determination and assessment of bladder cancer (BC) extent of muscle invasion involvement guides proper risk stratification and personalized therapy selection. In this context, segmentation of both bladder walls and cancer are of pivotal importance, as it provides invaluable information to stage the primary tumor. Hence, multiregion segmentation on patients presenting with symptoms of bladder tumors using deep learning heralds a new level of staging accuracy and prediction of the biologic behavior of the tumor. Nevertheless, despite the success of these models in other medical problems, progress in multiregion bladder segmentation, particularly in MRI and CT modalities, is still at a nascent stage, with just a handful of works tackling a multiregion scenario. Furthermore, most existing approaches systematically follow prior literature in other clinical problems, without casting a doubt on the validity of these methods on bladder segmentation, which may present different challenges. Inspired by this, we provide an in-depth look at bladder cancer segmentation using deep learning models. The critical determinants for accurate differentiation of muscle invasive disease, current status of deep learning based bladder segmentation, lessons and limitations of prior work are highlighted.",nocancer
"Activatable contrast agents are of ongoing research interest because they offer low background and high specificity to the imaging target. Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe. Overall, these results demonstrate a tunable scaffold for the PA molecular imaging of protease activity with potential value in areas such as disease monitoring, tumor imaging, intraoperative imaging, in vitro diagnostics, and point-of-care sensing.",nocancer
"Strategies aiming at increasing the survival and paracrine activity of human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are of utmost importance to achieve the full therapeutic potential of these cells. Herein, we propose both physical and biochemical strategies to enhance the survival, homing, angiogenic and immunomodulatory properties of MSCs in vitro. To that purpose, we compared the effect of exposing either 2-D monolayer or 3-D spheroids of MSCs to (i) hypoxia (2% O2 ) or to (ii) a hypoxic-mimetic small molecule, dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), with cells cultured at 21% O2 . 3-D-cultured MSC spheroids evidenced higher survival upon exposure to oxidative stress and expressed higher levels of factors involved in tissue repair processes, namely tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). MSCs cultured as 3-D spheroids and further exposed to hypoxia or hypoxic-mimetic conditions provided by DMOG synergistically favored the expression of the cell surface marker C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 (CXCR4), involved in homing processes to injured tissues, and adhesion to extracellular matrix components as fibronectin. These results highlight the role of ex-vivo preconditioning approaches, presenting a novel strategy that combine biochemical stimuli with 3-D spheroid organization of MSCs to maximize their tissue regeneration potential.

"BACKGROUND: Many pediatric cancer centers still use Gentamicin as first line combination treatment in patients with fever and neutropenia. Since 2011, our center has implemented a dosing regimen with 250 mg/m2 BSA (max. 10 mg/kg, max. 400 mg) as a single daily infusion according to the German guideline. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective audit (February 2011 to December 2019), 105 Gentamicin treatment cycles were analyzed in 66 pediatric cancer patients, focusing on adherence to the dosing regimen and the drug monitoring results. RESULTS: Adherence to the dosing regimen was high (89%). In 64% of all cycles, the Cmax (drawn 1 h after the 2nd dose) reached the target of 10-20 microg/ml. Cmax significantly correlated with dosing in mg/m2 BSA (p=0,007), but not with dosing in mg/kg (p=0,366). Age below 6 years did not influence these results. The Gentamicin Ctrough (drawn 8-10 h after the second dose) was < 2 microg/ml in 93% of all cycles without any dose correlation. None of the patients experienced Gentamicin-associated nephrotoxicity. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This prospective audit of single daily infusion Gentamicin in pediatric cancer patients without impaired renal function elicits the feasibility and safety of the dosing regimen in mg/m2 BSA according to the German guideline. Since indications for first-line gentamicin are limited, a multicenter prospective study would be advantageous to confirm these observations.",nocancer
"The hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME) and non-specific distribution of sonosensitizers are two major obstacles that limit practical applications of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in combating tumors. Here we report a hypoxia-responsive nanovesicle (hMVs) as delivery vehicles of a sonosensitizer to enhance the efficacy of SDT via specific payload release and local oxygenation in the tumor. The nanovesicles are composed of densely packed manganese ferrite nanoparticles (MFNs) embedded in hypoxia-responsive amphiphilic polymer membranes. With delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) loaded in the hollow cavities, the hMVs could rapidly dissociate into discrete nanoparticles in the hypoxic TME to release the payload and induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound (US) radiation. Meanwhile, the released MFNs could catalytically generate O2 to overcome the hypoxic TME and thus enhance the efficacy of SDT. After treatment, the dissociated MFNs could be readily excreted from the body via renal clearance to reduce long term toxicity. In vitro and in vivo experiments displayed effective tumor inhibition via hMVs-mediated SDT, indicating the great potential of this unique nanoplatform in effective SDT by generating sufficient ROS in deep-seated hypoxic tumors that are not readily accessible by conventional photodynamic therapy.",nocancer
"The DACHPtCl2 compound (trans-(R,R)-1,2-diaminocyclohexanedichloroplatinum(II)) is a potent anticancer drug with a broad spectrum of activity and is less toxic than oxaliplatin (trans-l-diaminocyclohexane oxalate platinum II), with which it shares the active metal fragment DACHPt. Nevertheless, due to poor water solubility, its use as a chemotherapeutic drug is limited. Here, DACHPtCl2 was conjugated, in a bidentate form, with half-generation PAMAM dendrimers (G0.5-G3.5) with carboxylate end-groups, and the resulting conjugates were evaluated against various types of cancer cell lines. In this way, we aimed at increasing the solubility and availability at the target site of DACHPt while potentially reducing the adverse side effects. DNA binding assays showed a hyperchromic effect compatible with DNA helix's disruption upon the interaction of the metallodendrimers and/or the released active metallic fragments with DNA. Furthermore, the prepared DACHPt metallodendrimers presented cytotoxicity in a wide set of cancer cell lines used (the relative potency regarding oxaliplatin was in general high) and were not hemotoxic. Importantly, their selectivity for A2780 and CACO-2 cancer cells with respect to non-cancer cells was particularly high. Subsequently, the anticancer drug 5-FU was loaded in a selected metallodendrimer (the G2.5COO(DACHPt)16) to investigate a possible synergistic effect between the two drugs carried by the same dendrimer scaffold and tested for cytotoxicity in A2780cisR and CACO-2 cancer cell lines. This combination resulted in IC50 values much lower than the IC50 for 5-FU but higher than those found for the metallodendrimers without 5-FU. It seems, thus, that the metallic fragment-induced cytotoxicity dominates over the cytotoxicity of 5-FU in the set of considered cell lines.",nocancer
"AIM AND OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the lockdown on oral oncology-related out-patient volume at Indian dental institutions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The total number of newly diagnosed cases of oral submucous fibrosis, oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and oral cancers, recorded at two dental institutional settings before lockdown (January-March 2020) and after lockdown (June-August 2020), were included retrospectively and compared. RESULTS: The study included a total of 797 cases at both institutions. At Institution-I, a total of 312 cases were recorded before the lockdown, and 63 cases were recorded after the lockdown. At Institution-II, a total of 311 cases were reported before lockdown, and 111 cases were recorded after lockdown. Comparisons between the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown data yielded a significant change in the proportions of oral sub-mucous fibrosis, oral leukoplakia, oral lichen planus, and oral cancers at both institutions (Chi-square test; p < 0.001). Following the lockdown, a substantial reduction was observed in the proportion of oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF) cases at both institutions, and the proportion of oral cancers increased at both institutions. There was a significant difference between the proportions of cases reported before lockdown at both institutions (p < 0.001). However, after-lockdown, no such differences were noted (p = 0.69); the absence of significance could most likely be due to the low sample size or low-power during the post-lockdown period. CONCLUSION: The oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) and oral cancer (OC) patient volumes reduced substantially following lockdown. During the post-lockdown period, the proportion of oral cancers increased, whereas the proportion of OSMF cases decreased. Results indicate that OPMD and oral cancer patients were impacted differently by the lockdown. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides insight into the impact of lockdown and highlights the importance of reestablishing oral oncology-related patient care. A vital discussion is also provided on useful compensatory strategies that may reduce delays during the ongoing crisis. How to cite this article: Panta P, Reddy P, Misra SR, et al.

"Objective: To investigate the occurrence and influencing factors of perioperative complications after robotic gynecologic surgery. Methods: The clinical data and occurrence of perioperative complications in 1 000 cases robotic surgery completed in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively analyzed. Results: (1) Clinical data: the average age of the patients was (50.2+-10.4) years old, and the average body mass index (BMI) was (24.4+-3.6) kg/m2. Among 1 000 cases, 811 cases of them were malignant tumors, including 405 cases of cervical cancer, 279 cases of endometrial carcinoma, 112 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), 15 cases of vulvar cancer; 189 cases of them were benign diseases, including 43 cases of uterine prolapse, 57 cases hysterectomy of uterine leiomyoma and adenomyosis of the uterus >=12 weeks, 84 cases myomectomy of uterine leiomyoma, and 5 cases of fallopian tubal ligation requiring anastomosis. Surgical methods: in patients with malignant tumors, cervical cancer, hysterectomy plus salpingectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy for stage Ia1, and radical hysterectomy plus pelvic lymphatic dissection plus salpingectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy for stage Ia2-IIb. Endometrial carcinoma, performed by staging surgery. Staging surgery for EOC with early stage and cytoreductive surgery with advanced EOC.

Tubal anastomosis for patients with fallopian tubal ligation. (2) Surgical complications: intraoperative complications occurred in 25 patients (2.5%, 25/1 000), including 11 patients with vascular laceration, 11 patients with ureteral injury, 2 patients with bladder injury, and 1 patient with intestinal injury. Postoperative complications occurred in 130 patients (13.0%, 130/1 000), including 66 cases of lower limb venous thrombosis, 20 cases of lymphatic cyst, 8 cases of hydronephrosis, 9 cases of ileus, 16 cases with infection, 6 cases with genital fistula, 4 cases with trocar site herniation and 1 case with subcutaneous emphysema. The incidence of intraoperative complications was 3.1% (25/811) in malignant tumors and no case in benign diseases, the incidence rate in malignant tumors was significantly higher than that in benign diseases (chi2=4.778, P=0.029). The incidence rate in cervical cancer (4.2%, 17/405) and EOC (3.6%, 4/112) were significantly higher than those in endometrial carcinoma (1.4%, 4/279) and vulvar cancer (0/15; P<0.05). The incidence of postoperative complications was 15.2% (123/811) in malignant tumors and 3.7% (7/189) in benign diseases. The incidence rate in malignant tumors was significantly higher than that in benign diseases (chi2=17.807, P<0.01), but there were no significant difference among different malignant tumors (chi2=4.318, P=0.229). (3) The correlative factors affecting the occurrence of surgical complications: patient's age, BMI, previous pelvic or abdominal surgery history, the nature of disease (malignant or benign), operation time, and comorbidities had a significant impact on the incidence of postoperative complications (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the patient's age >=40 years old, BMI >=25 kg/m2, previous pelvic or abdominal surgery history, malignant tumors and comorbidities were independent influential factors of the postoperative complications (P<0.05). Conclusions: Perioperative complications vary according to the type of the surgery. The age, BMI, previous pelvic or abdominal surgery history, malignant tumors, and comorbidities are influential factors of postoperative complications.",nocancer
"The development of interventions aimed at improving healthspan is one of the priority tasks for the academic and public health authorities. It is also the main objective of a novel branch in biogerontological research, geroscience. According to the geroscience concept, targeting aging is an effective way to combat age-related disorders. Since aging is an exceptionally complex process, system-oriented integrated approaches seem most appropriate for such an interventional strategy. Given the high plasticity and adaptability of the epigenome, epigenome-targeted interventions appear highly promising in geroscience research. Pharmaceuticals targeted at mechanisms involved in epigenetic control of gene activity are actively developed and implemented to prevent and treat various aging-related conditions such as cardiometabolic, neurodegenerative, inflammatory disorders, and cancer. In this review, we describe the roles of epigenetic mechanisms in aging; characterize enzymes contributing to the regulation of epigenetic processes; particularly focus on epigenetic drugs, such as inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases and histone deacetylases that may potentially affect aging-associated diseases and longevity; and discuss possible caveats associated with the use of epigenetic drugs.",nocancer
"Curcumin (Cur), a hydrophobic active pharmaceutical ingredient with high anticancer activity, has poor water solubility and low bioavailability. Although many delivery systems have been developed to improve their bioavailability, some limitation such as low drug loading efficiency and poor stability are still remained. The metal-polyphenol networks (MPNs) delivery system designed in this subject solved above problems and effectively improved the anticancer activity of Cur. The synthesized Cur@EGCG-Fe(III) is consisting of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), iron chloride (FeCl3) and Cur, and the well-designed structure endow Cur@EGCG-Fe(III) high loading efficiency, good water solubility and stability. After the Cur@EGCG-Fe(III) nanoparticles were internalized by MCF-7 cells, the Cur could be released in endo/lysosomal microenvironment (pH=5.0), and the Cur delivery in the deep tumor could be realized. The distribution of Cur@EGCG-Fe(III) in MCF-7 cells was analyzed by laser confocal, and Cur@EGCG-Fe(III) could effectively deliver more Cur into MCF-7 cells in comparison with free Cur. In addition, the results of flow cytometry and western blot further indicated that Cur@EGCG-Fe(III) had a stronger ability to induce apoptosis than free Cur. Transwell cell migration and invasion experiments showed that Cur and EGCG-Fe(III) had a synergistic effect in inhibiting MCF-7 cell migration and invasion. In vitro hemolysis and in vivo experiments showed that the Cur@EGCG-Fe(III) had negligible effect on the blood environment and a great tumor-inhibition efficacy, indicating that the MPNs delivery system had a good blood compatibility and antitumor activity. Our results indicated that MPNs-coated Cur nanoparticle could be a new form of Cur delivery system for anticancer application.",nocancer
"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) can represent a novel source of disease biomarkers, and are under intensive study for their clinical potential. Most EV-based cancer diagnostic studies have focused on establishing EV assays that detect increased expression of a single cancer-associated marker or marker signatures based on multiplex detection of these biomarkers. EV biomarker readouts can be obscured by high background signal leading to false positives, and may markedly differ between analyses due to variation in sample purity during EV isolation. This can obstruct the comparisons among studies and lead to conflicting conclusions. This work reports that the nucleic acid to protein UV absorption ratio of an EV is a cell-specific EV characteristic. This EV collective attribute can be measured at low-cost to discriminate EVs derived from malignant and non-malignant cells rather than employing single markers that may be cancer- or subtype-specific. Our work also highlighted the application for accessing purity in EV preparations irrelevant to EV yield. It can be employed to distinguish from patients with and without malignant disease upon analysis of EVs isolated from their serum samples.",nocancer
"Therapeutic drug delivery microrobots capable of accurate targeting using an electromagnetic actuation (EMA) system are being developed. However, these drug delivery microrobots include a large number of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for accurate EMA targeting, which causes side effects, such as problems with membrane integrity and normal cell apoptosis. Here, a biocompatible and hydrolyzable PEGDA-based drug delivery helical microrobot capable of MNP retrieval is proposed in which doxorubicin (DOX), an anticancer drug, is encapsulated and MNPs are conjugated by a disulfide bond. After being accurately delivered to the lesion of cancer cells through magnetic field manipulation, the fabricated microrobot provides rapid MNP separation and retrieval from the microrobot because of the use of dithiothreitol (DTT), a reducing agent, as an environment similar to the surrounding cancer cells and near-infrared (NIR) as an external stimulus. The characteristics of the fabricated microrobot are analyzed, and fundamental tests for active electromagnetic field manipulation, separation/retrieval of MNPs from the microrobot, and its hydrolysis are discussed. The therapeutic performance of the fabricated microrobot is verified through an in vitro test using tumor cells. Consequently, by use of an integrated system of microscope, eight-coil EMA, and NIR it is shown that the proposed microrobot can be moved to the target site by electromagnetic manipulation. The MNPs conjugated to the microrobot can be separated and retrieved, and the therapeutic effect on tumor cells by the encapsulated drug can be seen.",nocancer
"A chalcone series (3a-f) with electron push-pull effect was synthesized via a one-pot Claisen-Schmidt reaction with a simple purification step. The compounds exhibited strong emission, peaking around 512-567 nm with mega-stokes shift ( lambda = 93-139 nm) in polar solvents (DMSO, MeOH, and PBS) and showed good photo-stability. Therefore, 3a-f were applied in cellular imaging. After 3 h of incubation, green fluorescence was clearly brighter in cancer cells (HepG2) compared to normal cells (HEK-293), suggesting preferential accumulation in cancer cells. Moreover, all compounds exhibited higher cytotoxicity within 24 h toward cancer cells (IC50 values ranging from 45 to 100 muM) than normal cells (IC50 value >100 muM). Furthermore, the antimicrobial properties of chalcones 3a-f were investigated. Interestingly, 3a-f exhibited antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of 0.10-0.60 mg/mL (375-1000 microM), suggesting their potential antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, this series of chalcone-derived fluorescent dyes with facile synthesis shows great potential for the development of antibiotics and cancer cell staining agents.",nocancer

"The aim of this study was to establish the fine structure of fucoidan from Sargassum oligocystum and to study the radiosensitizing effect of fucoidans from three algae of genus Sargassum (S. oligocystum, S. duplicatum, and S. feldmannii) with different structures. The fucoidan SoF2 from S. oligocystum was sulfated (32%) galactofucan (Fuc:Gal = 2:1), with a Mw of 183 kDa (Mw/Mn = 2.0). Its supposed structure was found to be predominantly 1,3-linked fucose as the main chain, with branching points at C2 and C4. The branches could be single galactose and/or fucose short chains with terminal galactose residues. Sulfate groups were found at positions C3, C2, and/or C4 of fucose residues and at C2 and/or C4 of galactose residues. The radiosensitizing effect of galactofucans from S. oligocystum, S. duplicatum, and S. feldmannii against human melanoma SK-MEL-28, colon HT-29, and breast MDA-MB-231 cancer cells was investigated. The influence of all investigated polysaccharides treatments with/without X-ray radiation on colony formation of human melanoma cells SK-MEL-28 was weak. Fucoidan from S. feldmannii has been shown to be the most promising radiosensitizing compound against human colon HT-29 and breast MDA-MB-231 cancer cells.",nocancer
"Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) has become the first-tier testing for chromosomal abnormalities and copy number variations (CNV). This review described the clinical validation of CMA, the development and updating of technical standards and guidelines and their diagnostic impacts. The main focuses were on the development and updating of expert consensus, practice resources, and a series of technical standards and guidelines through systematic review of case series with CMA application in the literature. Expert consensus and practice resource supported the use of CMA as the first-tier testing for detecting chromosomal abnormalities and CNV in developmental and intellectual disabilities, multiple congenital anomalies and autism. The standards and guidelines have been applied to pre- and postnatal testing for constitutional CNV and tumor testing for acquired CNV. CMA has significantly improved the diagnostic yields but still needs to overcome its technical limitations and face challenges of new technologies. Guiding and governing CMA through expert consensus, practice resource, standards and guidelines in the United States has provided effective and safe diagnostic services to patients and their families, reliable diagnosis on related genetic diseases for clinical database and basic research, and references for clinical translation of new technologies.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus is the most common sexually transmitted infection. It is associated with different cancers, mainly cervical cancer, which remains the fourth most frequent cancer among women worldwide; it is also related to anogenital (anus, vulvar, vagina, and penis) and oropharyngeal cancers. Vaccination against HPV infection is the major way of prevention, and it has demonstrated impressive efficacy in reducing cervical cancer incidence. Nowadays, all the licensed HPV recombinant vaccines were designed based on HPV major capsid L1 protein. However, some variations in the HPV L1 gene sequence may induce structural changes within the L1 protein, which may alter the affinity and interaction of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with L1 protein epitopes, and influence host immune response and recognition. Hence, the importance of accuracy in delineating epitopes relevant to vaccine design and defining genetic variations within antigenic regions in the L1 gene to predict its impact on prophylactic vaccine efficiency. The present review reports the sequence variations in HR-HPV L1 gene isolates from different countries around the world, which may help to understand the effect of HPV L1 gene variations on vaccine efficiency. METHODS: Research studies were retrieved from PubMed, Google Scholar, Science direct, and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. A total of 31 articles describing genetic variations within the major capsid L1 gene and conducted in Africa, Europe, America and Asia were found. Only 26 studies conducted on HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 58, 45 and 52 which are the targets of HPV prophylactic vaccines, and which reported genetic variations within the L1 gene, were selected and evaluated in this review. FINDINGS: We found a total of 87, 49, 11, 7, 22, 3, and 17 non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within HPV16, HPV18, HPV31, HPV58, HPV45, and HPV52 L1 gene, respectively. Four mutations were frequently observed in HPV16 L1 sequences: T353P in the HI loop, H228D in the EF loop, T266A in the FG loop, and T292A in the FG loop. Two mutations in HPV58 L1 sequences: T375N in the HI loop and L150F in the DE loop. Three mutations in HPV33 L1 sequences: T56N in the BC loop, G133S in the DE loop, T266K in the FG loop. Other mutations were found in HPV18, HPV45, and HPV52 L1 sequences. Some were found in different countries, and others were specific to a given population. Furthermore, some variations were located on peptide binding epitopes and lead to a modification of epitopes, which may influence MAbs interactions. Others need further investigations due to the lack of studies. CONCLUSION: This study investigated the major capsid L1 genetic diversity of HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 58, 45, and 52 circulating in different populations around the world. Further investigations should be conducted to confirm their effect on immunogenicity and prophylactic vaccine efficiency.",nocancer
"Multidrug resistance (MDR) is one of the prime reasons for the failure of cancer chemotherapy, which continues to be a great challenge to be solved. In this work, alpha-tocopherol succinate (alpha-TOS) and doxorubicin (DOX)-based self-delivery nanomedicine (designated as alpha-TD) is prepared to combat drug resistance for cancer synergistic chemotherapy. Carrier-free alpha-TD possesses a fairly high drug loading rate and improves the cellular uptake via the endocytosis pathway. More importantly, the apoptotic inducer alpha-TOS could elevate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, disrupt mitochondrial function and reduce adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) production, which facilitate the intracellular drug retention while decreasing its efflux. As a result, alpha-TD achieves a considerable synergistic chemotherapeutic effect against drug resistant cancer cells. Moreover, it also exhibits a preferable inhibitory effect on tumor growth with a low system toxicity in vivo. This synergistic drug self-delivery strategy would open a new window for developing carrier-free nanomedicine for overcoming drug resistance in cancer therapy.",nocancer
"Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has demonstrated versatile biomedical applications, ranging from tracking single cells to monitoring whole-body dynamics of small animals and diagnosing human breast cancer. Currently, PAT has two major implementations: photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) and photoacoustic microscopy (PAM). PACT uses a multi-element ultrasonic array for parallel detection, which is relatively complex and expensive. In contrast, PAM requires point-by-point scanning with a single-element detector, which has a limited imaging throughput. The trade-off between the system cost and throughput demands a new imaging method. To this end, we have developed photoacoustic topography through an ergodic relay (PATER). PATER can capture a wide-field image with only a single-element ultrasonic detector upon a single laser shot. This protocol describes the detailed procedures for PATER system construction, including component selection, equipment setup and system alignment. A step-by-step guide for in vivo imaging of a mouse brain is provided as an example application. Data acquisition, image reconstruction and troubleshooting procedures are also elaborated. It takes ~130 min to carry out this protocol, including ~60 min for both calibration and snapshot wide-field data acquisition using a laser with a 2-kHz pulse repetition rate. PATER offers low-cost snapshot wide-field imaging of fast dynamics, such as visualizing blood pulse wave propagation and tracking melanoma tumor cell circulation in mice in vivo. We envision that PATER will have wide biomedical applications and anticipate that the compact size of the setup will allow it to be further developed as a wearable device to monitor human vital signs.",nocancer
"With an aim to develop novel potential anti-cancer agents we have designed a series of novel 4,7-disubstituted coumarin hybrids synthesis and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against the human carbonic anhydrase isoforms namely CA I, CA II, CA IX and CA XII. The results of CA inhibition clearly showed that the novel 4, 7-disubstituted coumarin hybrids (7a-i & 8a-j) exhibited selective inhibition towards tumor associated isoforms, CA IX and CA XII without inhibiting CA I and CA II isoforms. Among all the compound 8b showed a significant inhibition against hCA IX with a Ki of 0.58 microM whereas, the compound 7c showed a significant inhibition against hCA XII with a Ki of 0.36 microM respectively. All other compounds have shown a good inhibition against hCA IX and hCA XII over hCA I and hCA II within the range of 0.46 to 9.35 microM. Therefore, compound 8b and 7c would be the potential leads for developing selective cytotoxic agents targeting hCA IX and XII.",nocancer
"Tumour hypoxia negatively impacts therapy outcomes and continues to be a major unsolved clinical problem. Nitroimidazoles are hypoxia selective compounds that become entrapped in hypoxic cells by forming drug-protein adducts. They are widely used as hypoxia diagnostics and have also shown promise as hypoxia-directed therapeutics. However, little is known about the protein targets of nitroimidazoles and the resulting effects of their modification on cancer cells. Here, we report the synthesis and applications of azidoazomycin arabinofuranoside (N3-AZA), a novel click-chemistry compatible 2-nitroimidazole, designed to facilitate (a) the LC-MS/MS-based proteomic analysis of 2-nitroimidazole targeted proteins in FaDu head and neck cancer cells, and (b) rapid and efficient labelling of hypoxic cells and tissues. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that many of the 62 target proteins we identified participate in key canonical pathways including glycolysis and HIF1A signaling that play critical roles in the cellular response to hypoxia. Critical cellular proteins such as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the detoxification enzyme glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP1) appeared as top hits, and N3-AZA adduct formation significantly reduced their enzymatic activities only under hypoxia. Therefore, GAPDH, GSTP1 and other proteins reported here may represent candidate targets to further enhance the potential for nitroimidazole-based cancer therapeutics.",nocancer
"Cisplatin and derivatives are highly effective in the treatment of a wide range of cancer types; however, these metallodrugs display low selectivity, leading to severe side effects. Additionally, their administration often results in the development of chemoresistance, which ultimately results in therapeutic failure. This scenario triggered the study of other transition metals with innovative pharmacological profiles as alternatives to platinum, ruthenium- (e.g., KP1339 and NAMI-A) and gold-based (e.g., Auranofin) complexes being among the most advanced in terms of clinical evaluation. Concerning the importance of improving the in vivo selectivity of metal complexes and the current relevance of ruthenium and gold metals, this review article aims to survey the main research efforts made in the past few years toward the design and biological evaluation of target-specific ruthenium and gold complexes. Herein, we give an overview of the inorganic and organometallic molecules conjugated to different biomolecules for targeting membrane proteins, namely cell adhesion molecules, G-protein coupled receptors, and growth factor receptors. Complexes that recognize the progesterone receptors or other targets involved in metabolic pathways such as glucose transporters are discussed as well. Finally, we describe some complexes aimed at recognizing cell organelles or compartments, mitochondria being the most explored. The few complexes addressing targeted gene therapy are also presented and discussed.",nocancer
"OBJECTIVES: To explore the expression of cytoskeletal and cell proliferation proteins in urothelial cells of patients diagnosed with various clinical subtypes of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. METHODS: Biopsy specimens from 85 interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patients were classified according to findings on cystoscopy. Cytokeratins and cell proliferation proteins detected in the specimens were evaluated with immunofluorescence staining and quantified with western blotting. A total of 22 patients diagnosed with pure stress urinary incontinence were enrolled as controls. RESULTS: Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patients with Hunner's lesion and with grade 3 glomerulation hemorrhage had smaller bladder capacities than the other interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patients without Hunner's lesion. Diminished expression of CK14, CK20, cell proliferation protein tumor protein 63, sonic hedgehog, and fibroblast growth factor receptors 3 and 4, and increased expression of CK5 and BCL2-associated X protein were observed in biopsy specimens from patients with Hunner's lesion compared with those from patients without Hunner's lesion and controls. In the patients with grade 3 glomerulation hemorrhage, lower expression levels of urothelial CK20, tumor protein 63 and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4, and lower expression of CK5 and BCL2-associated X protein were detected compared with other types of NHIC. CONCLUSION: A diminished expression of proliferation proteins tumor protein 63 and the mature urothelium marker CK20, and increased expression of the immature marker CK5 in specimens from both Hunner's lesion and grade 3 glomerulation hemorrhage patients can be observed. The urothelium of patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome might be in a state of persistent or chronic injury that could relate to the limited expression of cell proliferation proteins.",nocancer
"The present research work is designed to prepare and evaluate piperine liposomes and piperine-chitosan-coated liposomes for oral delivery. Piperine (PPN) is a water-insoluble bioactive compound used for different diseases. The prepared formulations were evaluated for physicochemical study, mucoadhesive study, permeation study and in vitro cytotoxic study using the MCF7 breast cancer cell line. Piperine-loaded liposomes (PLF) were prepared by the thin-film evaporation method. The selected liposomes were coated with chitosan (PLFC) by electrostatic deposition to enhance the mucoadhesive property and in vitro therapeutic efficacy. Based on the findings of the study, the prepared PPN liposomes (PLF3) and chitosan coated PPN liposomes (PLF3C1) showed a nanometric size range of 165.7 +- 7.4 to 243.4 +- 7.5, a narrow polydispersity index (>0.3) and zeta potential (-7.1 to 29.8 mV). The average encapsulation efficiency was found to be between 60 and 80% for all prepared formulations. The drug release and permeation study profile showed biphasic release behavior and enhanced PPN permeation. The in vitro antioxidant study results showed a comparable antioxidant activity with pure PPN. The anticancer study depicted that the cell viability assay of tested PLF3C2 has significantly (p < 0.001)) reduced the IC50 when compared with pure PPN. The study revealed that oral chitosan-coated liposomes are a promising delivery system for the PPN and can increase the therapeutic efficacy against the breast cancer cell line.",nocancer
"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recognized as promising drug delivery vesicles. However, the limitation of drug loading capacity and safety considerations are two obstacles to the further application of MSCs. Here, we report MSC membrane-coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN@M) that maintain the active stealth and self-positioning drug delivery abilities of MSCs and resolve issues related to MSCs-mediated drug delivery. MSN@M was established through uniformly integrating MSC membrane onto a mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) core by sonication. Reduced clearance of phagocytes mediated by CD47 marker on MSC membrane was observed in vitro, which explained the only ~25% clearance rate of MSN@M compared with MSN in vivo within 24 h. MSN@M also showed stronger tumor targeting and penetration ability compared with MSN in HepG2 tumor bearing mice. Simultaneously, MSN@M exhibited strong capacity for drug loading and sustained drug release ability of MSN when loaded with doxorubicin (DOX), the drug loading of MSN@M increased ~5 folds compared with MSC membrane. In HepG2 xenograft mice, DOX-loaded MSN@M effectively inhibited the growth of tumors and decreased the side effects of treatment by decreasing the exposure of other tissues to DOX. Consequently, our MSN@M may serve as alternative vesicles for MSCs and provide more options for antitumor treatment.",nocancer

"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived vesicles important in intercellular communication that play an essential role in host-pathogen interactions, spreading pathogen-derived as well as host-derived molecules during infection. Pathogens can induce changes in the composition of EVs derived from the infected cells and use them to manipulate their microenvironment and, for instance, modulate innate and adaptive inflammatory immune responses, both in a stimulatory or suppressive manner. Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is considered the main risk factor for developing this disease, which is characterized by a strong inflammatory component. EVs released by host cells infected with H. pylori contribute significantly to inflammation, and in doing so promote the development of disease. Additionally, H. pylori liberates vesicles, called outer membrane vesicles (H. pylori-OMVs), which contribute to atrophia and cell transformation in the gastric epithelium. In this review, the participation of both EVs from cells infected with H. pylori and H. pylori-OMVs associated with the development of gastric cancer will be discussed. By deciphering which functions of these external vesicles during H. pylori infection benefit the host or the pathogen, novel treatment strategies may become available to prevent disease.",nocancer
"Maloplatin-B, a cisplatin-based complex, namely [Pt(A-BOD)(NH3)2](NO3) (Pt-A-BOD) with a pendant boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) moiety, where HA-BOD is a methyl malonyl chloride derived monostyryl BODIPY ligand, was designed and developed as near-IR light (600-720 nm) organelle-targeting photodynamic therapy agent. The complex [Pt(acac)(NH3)2](NO3) (Pt-Ac) was used as a control. Pt-A-BOD displayed an absorption band at 616 nm (epsilon = 2.9 x 104 M-1 cm-1) in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide/Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMSO/DMEM, pH 7.2). This complex displayed a broad emission band within 650-850 nm with a lambdaem value of 720 nm in 10% DMSO-DMEM (pH 7.2) upon excitation (lambdaex) at 615 nm with a large Stokes shift. The fluorescence quantum yield (PhiF) value for Pt-A-BOD is 0.032 and for the ligand HA-BOD is 0.24. The BODIPY complex and ligand showed the formation of singlet oxygen as the ROS (reactive oxygen species) on irradiation with near-IR red light of 660 nm, as evidenced from a 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) assay. The complex displayed remarkable apoptotic NIR light-induced PDT activity with half-maximum inhibitory concentration values (IC50) of 1.6-2.4 muM in A549 lung and HeLa cervical cancer cells, while it was less active in the dark. The cellular ROS generation by the complex in red light was ascertained by a DCFDA (2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate) assay. Cellular imaging showed its localization primarily in the mitochondria of A549 cancer cells. The JC1 and Annexin-V FITC/PI assays carried out for A549 cancer cells treated with the BODIPY complex showed the alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic cell death on near-IR red light (600-720 nm) irradiation, respectively.",nocancer
"The aim of this study is to evaluate the dosimetric impact of gadolinium contrast medium (Gadovist) in a transverse MR-Linac system using Monte Carlo methods. The dose distributions were calculated using two heterogeneous multi-layer phantoms consisting of Gadovist, water, bone, and lung. The photon beam was irradiated with a filed size of 5 x 5 cm2, and a transverse magnetic field of 0-3.0 T was applied perpendicular to the incident photon beam. Next, dose distributions for brain, head and neck (H&N), and lung cancer patients were calculated using a patient voxel-based phantom with and without replacing the patient's GTV with Gadovist. The dose at the water-Gadovist interface increased by 8% without a magnetic field. A similar dose increment was observed at 0.35 T. In contrast, the dose increment at the water-Gadovist interface was small at 1.5 T and a dose decrement of 5% was observed at 3.0 T. The dose variation at the lung-Gadovist interface was larger than that at the water-Gadovist interface. The mass collision stopping power ratio for Gadovist was 7% lower than that for water, whereas, the electron fluence spectra at the water-Gadovist interface increased by 17.5%. In a patient study, Gadovist increased the Dmean for brain, H&N, and lung cancer patients by 0.65-8.9%. The dose variation due to Gadovist grew large in the low-dose region in H&N and lung cancer. The GTV dose variation due to Gadovist in all treatment site was below 2% at 0-3 T if the Gadovist concentration was lower than 0.2 mmol/ml-1.",nocancer

"Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1) is a promising target for anticancer therapy due to its ability to counter the effects topoisomerase 1 (Top1) poison, such as topotecan, thus, decreasing their efficacy. Compounds containing adamantane and monoterpenoid residues connected via 1,2,4-triazole or 1,3,4-thiadiazole linkers were synthesized and tested against Tdp1. All the derivatives exhibited inhibition at low micromolar or nanomolar concentrations with the most potent inhibitors having IC50 values in the 0.35-0.57 microM range. The cytotoxicity was determined in the HeLa, HCT-116 and SW837 cancer cell lines; moderate CC50 (microM) values were seen from the mid-teens to no effect at 100 microM. Furthermore, citral derivative 20c, alpha-pinene-derived compounds 20f, 20g and 25c, and the citronellic acid derivative 25b were found to have a sensitizing effect in conjunction with topotecan in the HeLa cervical cancer and colon adenocarcinoma HCT-116 cell lines.

"Encapsulation of small molecule drugs in long-circulating lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can reduce toxic side effects and enhance accumulation at tumor sites. A fundamental problem, however, is the slow release of encapsulated drugs from these liposomal systems at the disease site resulting in limited therapeutic benefit. Methods to trigger release at specific sites are highly warranted. Here, it is demonstrated that incorporation of ultraviolet (UV-A) or red-light photoswitchable-phosphatidylcholine analogs (AzoPC and redAzoPC) in conventional LNPs generates photoactivatable LNPs (paLNPs) having comparable structural integrity, drug loading capacity, and size distribution to the parent DSPC-cholesterol liposomes. It is shown that 65-70% drug release (doxorubicin) can be induced from these systems by irradiation with pulsed light based on trans-to-cis azobenzene isomerization. In vitro it is confirmed that paLNPs are non-toxic in the dark but convey cytotoxicity upon irradiation in a human cancer cell line. In vivo studies in zebrafish embryos demonstrate prolonged blood circulation and extravasation of paLNPs comparable to clinically approved formulations, with enhanced drug release following irradiation with pulsed light. Conclusively, paLNPs closely mimic the properties of clinically approved LNPs with the added benefit of light-induced drug release making them promising candidates for clinical development.",nocancer
"PM2.5 and PM10 fugitive dust samples from multiple sources (construction, demolition, industrial, agricultural fields, and bare ground) were collected in triplicate for each size bin, from 18 distinct locations in and around Bhopal, central India. The dust samples were dried, sieved, and re-suspended in a chamber fitted with a suitable sampling system, to collect PM2.5 and PM10 samples onto Teflon and Quartz filters. The filters were subjected to gravimetric and chemical analyses. Trace elements, water-soluble ions, and thermal-optical carbon fractions were quantified using a variety of analyses. These species were then used to develop PM10 and PM2.5 chemical source profiles of the fugitive dust sources. As expected, crustal species were abundant in all source categories. For industrial dust, Fe contribution to mass in both size fractions was about 11.4% and above the upper continental crustal abundance. Further, the source profiles generated for each source were different from their counterparts in the US EPA SPECIATE database and profiles reported in literature. Thus, it will be useful to utilize profiles generated in this study to enhance receptor model performance for the study region. However, collinearity analysis of the profiles revealed that PM10 agricultural and bare ground dust; and PM2.5 construction and demolition dust profile pairs may not be separated by receptor models. Finally, a human health risk assessment revealed that construction and industrial dust may pose significant risk to the population. The Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) metric revealed that adults (2 x 10-5) and children (1 x 10-5) were susceptible to cancer risk from exposure to metals in PM2.5 fugitive dust. Further, children were more vulnerable than adults. This finding merits further investigation of oxidation state and solubility/bioavailability of Cr and Ni in fugitive dusts.",nocancer
"In this study, mesoporous silica nanocarriers were synthesized from natural sources such as rice and wheat husk for drug delivery application. First, the biogenic silica in cereals husk was extracted by acid leaching and then converted to sodium silicate as a silica precursor. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles were then synthesized by adding sodium silicate to the template mixture by continuous and discrete modes during the sol-gel process. The effects of natural sources type and precursor addition method on nanocarriers' morphological and physicochemical properties were investigated by XRD, FT-IR, BET and SEM analysis. Our results showed rice husk-based spherical nanocarriers were more crystalline with slit-shaped pores, while wheat husk-based nanocarriers had been composed of spherical nanoparticles with narrow cylindrical pores. The results also showed that by adding the precursor discretely, their hydrophilicity, particle size and pore size increased compared with the continuous mode, probably due to the high initial concentration of the precursor in the reaction mixture. Doxorubicin (Dox), as a model anticancer drug was loaded into the nanocarriers, and the drug release behavior was studied at two different pH values (7.4 and 5.4). In general, the accumulated released drug at pH 5.4 was approximately twice as much as pH 7.4 due to the higher solubility of doxorubicin at acidic environment. Also, the accumulated released drug at pH 5.4 for nanocarriers which had been synthesized by discrete mode, was higher than continuous mode, due to the larger pore diameter of them. The biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of nanocarriers and Dox-loaded nanocarriers were also investigated on the HFF-2 and MCF-7 cell lines, respectively. Moreover, apoptosis, as the mechanism of cell death, was evaluated by morphological study of the MCF-7 cells. Within acceptable toxicity limits and apoptosis induction, the Dox-loaded nanocarriers, especially discrete mode synthesized nanocarriers, exhibited high-efficiency anticancer effect on the MCF-7 cell line.",nocancer
"Gitelman syndrome is an autosomal recessive renal tubulopathy. A 38-year-old woman was diagnosed with Gitelman syndrome. Eight years later, F-FDG PET/CT was performed to evaluate recurrence of endometrial cancer. FDG PET images showed an extremely abnormal FDG biodistribution. They showed decreased brain uptake, increased cardiac muscle uptake, and diffuse increased muscle and adipose tissue uptake. This pattern is similar to high insulin state; however, her glucose level was normal, and insulin level was very low.",nocancer
"Cancer dominates among many causes of mortality worldwide. Traditional chemotherapeutic agents are powerful anti-cancer agents employed for treatment of this deadly disease. However, they are always associated with toxic side effects and immunosuppression making person more vulnerable to tumor relapse and fatalities. A promising alternative could be identification, isolation and transfer of naturally occurring bioactive macromolecules to the tumorigenic population. Oyster mushroom, a major source of nutraceuticals, belonging to class basidiomycetes of kingdom Mycota is known to have immense therapeutic properties. It is a reservoir of macromolecules like beta-glucan, alpha-glucan, resveratrol, concanavalin A, cibacron blue affinity protein, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, ergosterol, linoleic acid etc. that are responsible for mediating anti-tumor, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and anti-diabetic roles. Various studies have shown that extracts derived from oyster mushroom is rich in polysaccharides like beta-glucan and other macro molecules which have an anti-proliferative effect against cancer cell lines, without harming the normal cells. This review presents a brief highlight of the work covering the overall significance of oyster mushroom in different types of cancer treatment. It also explores the immunomodulatory effects of polysaccharides, proteoglycans and polypeptides derived from oyster mushroom that boosts the immune system to overcome the limitation of traditional cancer therapies.",nocancer
"Terpyridine platinum (TP)-based chemotherapeutic agents target three-dimensional structures on DNA known as G-quadruplexes. We report the rational design and synthesis of a TP conjugate combined with copper-64 (64Cu), the decay characteristics of which include emission of beta- and Auger electrons for radiotherapy and beta+ particles for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The present experimental studies show that the novel [64Cu]Cu-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA)-TP is stable, permitting selective killing of cancer cells. The antitumor activity of [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-TP at high apparent molar activity is in the low nanomolar range and 27,800-fold greater than that of natCu-NOTA-TP at 24 h post treatment. These results suggest that this combination of a cytotoxic TP agent with 64Cu has considerable potential for cancer treatment and PET imaging.",nocancer
"ARH3/ADPRHL2 and PARG are the primary enzymes reversing ADP-ribosylation in vertebrates, yet their functions in vivo remain unclear. ARH3 is the only hydrolase able to remove serine-linked mono(ADP-ribose) (MAR) but is much less efficient than PARG against poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains in vitro. Here, by using ARH3-deficient cells, we demonstrate that endogenous MARylation persists on chromatin throughout the cell cycle, including mitosis, and is surprisingly well tolerated. Conversely, persistent PARylation is highly toxic and has distinct physiological effects, in particular on active transcription histone marks such as H3K9ac and H3K27ac. Furthermore, we reveal a synthetic lethal interaction between ARH3 and PARG and identify loss of ARH3 as a mechanism of PARP inhibitor resistance, both of which can be exploited in cancer therapy. Finally, we extend our findings to neurodegeneration, suggesting that patients with inherited ARH3 deficiency suffer from stress-induced pathogenic increase in PARylation that can be mitigated by PARP inhibition.",nocancer
"A series of novel quinoline-based tetracyclic ring-systems were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for their antiplasmodial, antiproliferative and antimicrobial activities. The novel hydroiodide salts 10 and 21 showed the most promising antiplasmodial inhibition, with compound 10 displaying higher selectivity than the employed standards. The antiproliferative assay revealed novel pyridophenanthridine 4b to be significantly more active against human prostate cancer (IC50 = 24 nM) than Puromycin (IC50 = 270 nM) and Doxorubicin (IC50 = 830 nM), which are used for clinical treatment. Pyridocarbazoles 9 was also moderately effective against all the employed cancer cell lines and moreover showed excellent biofilm inhibition (9a: MBIC = 100 microM; 9b: MBIC = 100 microM).",nocancer
"Between October 2020 and January 2021, we conducted three national surveys to track anaesthetic, surgical and critical care activity during the second COVID-19 pandemic wave in the UK. We surveyed all NHS hospitals where surgery is undertaken. Response rates, by round, were 64%, 56% and 51%. Despite important regional variations, the surveys showed increasing systemic pressure on anaesthetic and peri-operative services due to the need to support critical care pandemic demands. During Rounds 1 and 2, approximately one in eight anaesthetic staff were not available for anaesthetic work. Approximately one in five operating theatres were closed and activity fell in those that were open. Some mitigation was achieved by relocation of surgical activity to other locations. Approximately one-quarter of all surgical activity was lost, with paediatric and non-cancer surgery most impacted. During January 2021, the system was largely overwhelmed. Almost one-third of anaesthesia staff were unavailable, 42% of operating theatres were closed, national surgical activity reduced to less than half, including reduced cancer and emergency surgery. Redeployed anaesthesia staff increased the critical care workforce by 125%. Three-quarters of critical care units were so expanded that planned surgery could not be safely resumed. At all times, the greatest resource limitation was staff. Due to lower response rates from the most pressed regions and hospitals, these results may underestimate the true impact. These findings have important implications for understanding what has happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, planning recovery and building a system that will better respond to future waves or new epidemics.",nocancer
"Growing evidence of successful outcomes achieved with the oocyte vitrification technique has greatly contributed to its application in the field of fertility preservation (FP). The population that can benefit from FP includes women at a risk of losing their ovarian function because of either iatrogenic causes or natural depletion of their ovarian reserve. Therefore, oncological patients and healthy women who wish to delay motherhood for various reasons-elective FP-are currently being offered this option. Satisfactory oocyte survival rates and clinical outcomes, including cumulative live birth rates, have been reported in recent years. These studies show that age at oocyte retrieval strongly affects reproductive prognosis after FP. Therefore, elective FP patients should be encouraged to decide before they reach the age of 35 years to significantly increase their chances of success. The effect of age has also been observed in patients with cancer and women diagnosed with endometriosis. The reproductive outcome after FP is worse in patients with cancer, but a direct association between the disease and reproductive outcome is yet to be proven. Young patients (<=35 years) with endometriosis who have undergone cystectomy before oocyte retrieval for FP have worse outcomes than nonoperated women in age-matched groups. In addition, the number of oocytes used per patient is closely related to success in all populations, with considerable improvement in the result with the addition of a few oocytes, especially in healthy young patients.",nocancer
"The epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular domain III (EGFR-ECDIII) protein is a promising target of anti-cancer research, and its production in Escherichia coli would thus represent significant benefits. However, despite its moderate size (19 kDa), the expression of EGFR-ECDIII in E.coli is hampered by the presence of multiple cysteines producing misfolded proteins with incorrect S-S bonds. In our study, we show that a short 12-residue solubility enhancing peptide (SEP) tag containing nine arginines (C9R) attached at the C-terminus of EGFR-ECDIII reduces the inclusion body formation and increases the final yield by six times (20 mg/L). EGFR-ECDIII-C9R purified from the soluble fraction eluted as a sharp single RP-HPLC peak, suggesting a single S-S bond pairing. Biophysical characterization using circular dichroism, fluorescence, and light scattering confirmed its native-like properties together with reversible thermal denaturation. The binding activity of EGFR-ECDIII-C9R to anti-EGFR-VHH7D12, a single-domain antibody with specific binding to the ECDIII, was assessed by sandwich ELISA. Further, we produced anti-EGFR-ECDIII-C9R antisera in mouse models and anti-sera inhibited A431 cancer cells' growth. These results demonstrate that the SEP tag enables the rapid production of the multiple disulfide-bonded EGFR-ECDIII in E. coli having native-like biophysical properties and producing neutralizing antibodies.",nocancer
"The exact role of innate immune cells upon infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and their contribution to the formation of the corona virus-induced disease (COVID)-19 associated cytokine storm is not yet fully understood. We show that human in vitro differentiated myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) as well as M1 and M2 macrophages are susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2 but are not productively infected. Furthermore, infected mDC, M1-, and M2 macrophages show only slight changes in their activation status. Surprisingly, none of the infected innate immune cells produced the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, or interferon (IFN)-alpha. Moreover, even in co-infection experiments using different stimuli, as well as non-influenza (non-flu) or influenza A (flu) viruses, only very minor IL-6 production was induced. In summary, we conclude that mDC and macrophages are unlikely the source of the first wave of cytokines upon infection with SARS-CoV-2.",nocancer
"Golgi apparatus is emerging as a key signaling hub of cells and an important target for cancer therapy, but there are few approaches for targeting Golgi and selectively killing cancer cells. Here we show an unexpected result that changing an oxygen atom of the phosphoester bond in phosphopeptides by a sulfur atom enables instantly targeting Golgi apparatus (GA) and selectively killing cancer cells by enzymatic self-assembly. Specifically, conjugating cysteamine S-phosphate to the C-terminal of a self-assembling peptide generates a thiophosphopeptide. Being a substrate of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), the thiophosphopeptide undergoes rapid ALP-catalyzed dephosphorylation to form a thiopeptide that self-assembles. The thiophosphopeptide enters cells via caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis and instantly accumulates in GA because of dephosphorylation and formation of disulfide bonds in Golgi by themselves and with Golgi proteins. Moreover, the thiophosphopeptide potently and selectively inhibits cancer cells (e.g., HeLa) with the IC 50 (about 3 muM), which is an order of magnitude more potent than that of the parent phosphopeptide. This work, as the first report of thiophosphopeptide for targeting Golgi, illustrates a new molecular platform for designing enzyme and redox responsive molecules that target subcellular compartment for functions.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Arthritis is one of the common causes of physical pain and disability, which often makes patients fall into major depression. However, the correlation between arthritis and major depression, and how different types of arthritis correspond to major depression remain to be explored. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between arthritis and major depression. METHODS: Arthritis status was reported by participants themselves, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) was used to evaluate major depression, logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship between arthritis and major depression. RESULTS: We analyzed the data of 25,990 adults who participated in the NHANES from 2007 to 2018. Participants with major depression were more likely to be female, Hispanic, smoker, less educated, less recreational activities, poverty-to-income ratio <5, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer or malignant tumor, diabetes, hypertension and higher body mass index (BMI). Arthritis was significantly correlated with major depression (25.4% vs. 44.9%; P<0.001), even after adjusting for gender, age, race, BMI, PIR, education, marriage, moderate recreational activities, smoking, history of coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer or malignant tumor, diabetes, and hypertension (OR =2.30, 95% CI, 2.06-2.56, P<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that compared with degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other arthritis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) had the greatest influence on major depression patients. CONCLUSIONS: All patients with arthritis, especially PsA, may have the risk of major depression. Psychological intervention necessary for patients with arthritis.",nocancer
"Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) accumulates within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells during physiological aging and in age-related diseases (ARDs) and the accumulation could be caused by the declined exclusion of nuclear eccDNA in these states. This review focuses on the formation of eccDNA and the roles of some main factors, such as nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR), and nuclear actin, in eccDNA exclusion. eccDNAs are mostly formed from non-coding DNA during DNA damage repair. They move to NPCs along nuclear actin and are excluded out of the nucleus through functional NPCs in young and healthy cells. However, it has been demonstrated that defective NPCs, abnormal NPC components and nuclear actin rods are increased in aged cells, various cancers and certain other ARDs such as cardiovascular diseases, premature aging, neurodegenerative diseases and myopathies. Therefore, mainly resulting from the increase of dysfunctional NPCs, the exclusion of nuclear eccDNAs may be reduced and eccDNAs thus accumulate within the nucleus in aging and the aforementioned ARDs. In addition, the protective function of non-coding DNA in tumorigenesis is further discussed.",nocancer
"The DNA microarray has distinctive advantages of high-throughput and less complicated operations, but tends to have a relatively low sensitivity. Catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA) is one of the most promising enzyme-free, isothermal DNA circuit for high efficient signal amplification. Here, a microarray-based catalytic hairpin assembly (mi-CHA) biosensing method has been developed to detect various miRNAs in a single test simultaneously. The target miRNA can trigger conformational transformations of hairpin-structured DNA probes on the chip surface and lead to the specific signal amplification. A significant advantage of this approach is that each duplex produced by the solid-phase CHA will be immobilized on the certain location of the chip and release fluorescent signal via the universal domain, eliminating the requirement of different fluorophores. This method has manifested a high detection sensitivity of human cancer-associated miRNAs (miR-21 and miR-155) down to 1.33 fM and promised a high specificity to distinguish single-base mismatches. Furthermore, the practicability of this method was demonstrated by analyzing target miRNAs in human serum and cancer cells. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method has high-throughput analytical potential and could be applied to many other clinical diagnosis.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To determine the radiation burden to infants undergoing voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) in a single institution and investigate the effect of shifting from analogue to digital imaging that allowed the use of a radiography-free examination protocol. METHODS: Anthropometric and exposure data were prospectively collected for 35 consecutive infants undergoing VCUG on a digital system with a standardized examination protocol not including radiographs. Thermoluminescent dosimeters were used to determine entrance-skin dose. Monte Carlo simulations and patient-specific anthropomorphic phantoms were employed to determine organ/tissue doses and effective dose (ED). The associated theoretical risk of radiation-induced cancer was determined and compared to the nominal risk of cancer induction. The radiation burden from VCUG on a modern digital system with a contemporary examination protocol was compared to corresponding data reported previously for an analogue system in the same institution. RESULTS: The median ED from VCUG was found 47 muSv. The associated total life attributable risk of radiation-induced cancer was found 10x10-6 and 13x10-6 for boys and girls, respectively. VCUG was found to increase the nominal risk of cancer by a factor of 1.000025 in boys and 1.000034 in girls. Shifting from analogue to digital imaging system resulted in 89% reduction of the radiation burden from VCUG. CONCLUSION: The theoretical radiation risks for infants undergoing VCUG using a modern digital imaging system and a radiography-free protocol were found to be minor. The transition from analogue to digital equipment resulted in considerable reduction of the radiation burden from VCUG.",nocancer
"Objective: Considering the reported elevation of -6/-3 fatty acid ratios in breast neoplasms, one particularly important application of 13C MRS could be in more fully understanding the breast lipidome's relationship to breast cancer incidence. However, the low natural abundance and gyromagnetic ratio of the 13C isotope lead to detection sensitivity challenges. Previous 13C MRS studies have relied on the use of small surface coils with limited field-of-view and shallow penetration depths to achieve adequate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and the use of receive array coils is still mostly unexplored. Methods: This work presents a unilateral breast 16-channel 13C array coil and interfacing hardware designed to retain the surface sensitivity of a single small loop coil while improving penetration depth and extending the field-of-view over the entire breast at 7T. The coil was characterized through bench measurements and phantom 13C spectroscopy experiments. Results: Bench measurements showed receive coil matching better than -17 dB and average preamplifier decoupling of 16.2 dB with no evident peak splitting. Phantom MRS studies show better than a three-fold increase in average SNR over the entirety of the breast region compared to volume coil reception alone as well as an ability for individual array elements to be used for coarse metabolite localization without the use of single-voxel or spectroscopic imaging methods. Conclusion: Our current study has shown the benefits of the array. Future in vivo lipidomics studies can be pursued. Significance: Development of the 16-channel breast array coil opens possibilities of in vivo lipidomics studies to elucidate the link between breast cancer incidence and lipid metabolics.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: Ginsenoside-Rg2 (G-Rg2) is a protopanaxatriol-type ginsenoside isolated from ginseng. It has been found to exhibit various pharmacological effects, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the anticancer effects of G-Rg2 on estrogen receptor-positive MCF-7 breast cancer (BC) cells, and the underlying mechanisms involving in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Cell viability, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and ROS production were measured following exposure to G-Rg2. The protein expression levels of p-ERK1/2, p-Akt, PARP, p-Rb, cyclin D1, CDK6, and p-AMPK were quantified using western blot analysis. The in vivo activity of G-Rg2 was assessed in a xenograft model. Immunohistochemistry staining for p-Rb and p-AMPK was performed in tumor tissues. RESULTS: G-Rg2 significantly decreased cell viability but increased cell apoptosis. In MCF-7 cells, G-Rg2 increased ROS production by inhibiting ERK1/2 and Akt activation. G-Rg2-induced ROS induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and AMPK phosphorylation. In the xenograft model, the 5 mg/kg G-Rg2-treated group showed decreased tumor volume and weight, similar to the 5 mg/kg 4-OHT-treated group, compared to the control group. Immunohistochemistry staining showed that G-Rg2 treatment decreased Rb phosphorylation, while increasing AMPK phosphorylation in tumor tissues. CONCLUSION: G-Rg2 has potential anticancer effects by increasing the ROS-AMPK signaling pathway and inhibiting ERK1/2 and Akt activation-mediated cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in MCF-7 BC cells.",nocancer
"Natural and synthetic environmental estrogens (EEs), interfering with the physiological functions of the body's estrogens, are widespread and are rising much concern for their possible deleterious effects on human and animal health, in particular on reproduction. In fact, increasing evidence indicate that EEs can be responsible for a variety of disfunctions of the reproductive system especially in females such as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). Because of their great structural diversity, the modes of action of EEs are controversial. One important way through which EEs exert their effects on reproduction is the induction of apoptosis in the ovary. In general, EEs can exert pro-and anti-apoptotic effects by agonizing or antagonizing numerous estrogen-dependent signaling pathways. In the present work, results concerning apoptotic pathways and diseases induced by representative EEs (such as zearalenone, bisphenol A and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate), in ovaries throughout development are presented into an integrated network. By reviewing and elaborating these studies, we propose inflammatory factors, centered on the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), as a major cause of the induction of apoptosis by EEs in the mammalian ovary. As a consequence, potential strategies to prevent such EE effect are suggested.",nocancer
"Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate the suitability of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) loaded with miltefosine (HePC) as an anticancer drug for the treatment of breast cancer. Methods: HePC-NLCs were prepared using a microemulsion technique and then evaluated for particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), incorporation efficiency, in vitro release of entrapped drug, and hemolytic potential. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic, biodistribution, and liver toxicity analyses were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats, and antitumor efficacy was evaluated in Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF-7) and squamous cell carcinoma-7 (SCC-7) cells in vitro and in tumour-bearing BALB/c mice in vivo. Advanced analyses including survival rate, immunohistopathology, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) assays were performed to evaluate apoptosis in vivo. Results: The average particle size of the HePC-NLCs was 143 +- 16 nm, with a narrow PDI (0.104 +- 0.002), and the incorporation efficiency was found to be 91 +- 7%. The NLCs released HePC in a sustained manner, and this release was significantly lower than that of free drug. The in vitro hemolytic assay demonstrated a significantly reduced hemolytic potential (~9%) of the NLCs compared to that of the test formulations. The HePC-NLCs demonstrated enhanced pharmacokinetic behaviour over free drug, including extended blood circulation and an abridged clearance rate in rats. Furthermore, the HePC-NLCs exhibited higher cytotoxicity than the free drug in MCF-7 and SCC-7 cells. Moreover, the HePC-NLCs showed significantly enhanced (P < 0.005) antitumor activity compared to that of the control and free drug-treated mouse groups. Tumour cell apoptosis was also confirmed, indicating the antitumor potential of the HePC-NLCs. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate the ability of NLCs as a drug delivery system for enhanced pharmacokinetic, antitumor, and apoptotic effects, most importantly when loaded with HePC.",nocancer
"The gas emissions generated from fires could cause mortalities and diseases in firefighters. Gas emissions from fire contain a mixture of a wide range of organic and inorganic gases, depending on several elements that are not currently known. In this study, firefighters were equipped with portable gas detectors to measure selected organic and inorganic gases in 26 emergency fire incidents. The fire incidents were categorized as industrial or residential based on their source. The exposure of firefighters to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in residential fires was double that in industrial fires. This is probably due to the contents of the houses, as more VOCs are released from textiles and furniture. The concentration of toluene, which is widely used in cosmetics and paints in housing, was fifteen-fold higher in residential fires than industrial fires. The exposure of firefighters to inorganic gases was much higher in industrial fires than residential fires. The concentration of hydrogen chloride, which is generated from the combustion of chlorinated plastics, such as industrial pipes and cables, in industrial fires was 18-fold higher than that in residential fires. Additionally, in this study, we found that the concentration of VOCs that poses cancer and non-cancer health risk to firefighters increases in residential fire incidents to almost three times that in industrial fire incidents. Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide concentrations were higher in industrial fire incidents than in residential fire incidents. The level of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide were 19-fold and 8-fold higher, respectively, in industrial fire incidents than in residential fire incidents. This study reveals that gas emissions vary widely between industrial and residential fires.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic reached South Africa (SA) in March 2020. A national lockdown began on 27 March 2020, and health facilities reduced non-essential activity, including many surgical services. OBJECTIVES:  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: to estimate the COVID-19 surgical backlog in Western Cape Province, SA, by comparing 2019 and 2020 general surgery operative volume and proportion at six district and regional hospitals. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: to compare the operative volume of appendicectomy, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, cancer and trauma between the 2 years. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of general surgery operations from six SA government hospitals in the Western Cape. Data were obtained from electronic operative databases or operative theatre logbooks from 1 April to 31 July 2019 and 1 April to 31 July 2020. RESULTS: Total general surgery operations decreased by 44% between 2019 (n=3 247) and 2020 (n=1 810) (p<0.001). Elective operations decreased by 74% (n=1 379 v. n=362; p<0.001), and one common elective procedure, laparoscopic cholecystectomy, decreased by 68% (p<0.001). Emergency operations decreased by 22% (n=1 868 v. n=1 448; p<0.001) and trauma operations by 42% (n=325 v. n=190; p<0.001). However, non-trauma emergency operations such as appendicectomy and cancer did not decrease. The surgical backlog for elective operations after 4 months from these six hospitals is 1 017 cases, which will take between 4 and 14 months to address if each hospital can do one additional operation per weekday. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created large backlogs of elective operations that will need to be addressed urgently. Clear and structured guidelines need to be developed in order to streamline the reintroduction of full surgical healthcare services as SA slowly recovers from this unprecedented pandemic.",nocancer
"Alcohol and physical inactivity are risk factors for a variety of cancer types. However, alcohol use often co-occurs with physical activity (PA), which could mitigate the cancer-prevention benefits of PA. Alcohol is integrated into the culture of one of the most popular physical activities for adults in the United States (U.S.), golf. This study examined how alcohol use was associated with total PA, golf-specific PA, and motives for golfing in a national sample of golfers in the U.S. Adult golfers (n = 338; 51% male, 81% White, 46 +- 14.4 years) self-reported alcohol use, golfing behavior and motives, and PA. Most (84%) golfers consumed alcohol, averaging 7.91 servings/week. Golf participation, including days/week, holes/week, and practice hours/week, was not associated with alcohol use. Golfers with stronger social motives were 60% more likely to consume alcohol. Weekly walking (incident risk ratio (IRR) = 7.30), moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA; IRR = 5.04), and total PA (IRR = 4.14) were associated with more alcohol servings/week. Golfers' alcohol use may be higher than the general adult population in the U.S. and contributes 775 extra kilocalories/week, a surplus that may offset PA-related energy expenditure and cancer-protective effects. Alcohol use interventions targeting golfers may facilitate weight loss and reduce cancer risk, especially for golfers motivated by social status.",nocancer

Hence, expectedly autophagic dysfunction has been documented in many diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration and cardiovascular disorders. A novel homozygous mutation in PLEKHM2 gene (mPLEKHM2) resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy with left ventricular noncompaction (DCM-LVNC), probably as result of impaired autophagy due to disruption of lysosomal movement assisted by PLEKHM2. Here we report a generation of three iPSC lines, four clones originated from two patients with homozygous mPLEKHM2 and two from a heterozygote sibling. All generated lines highly expressed pluripotency markers, spontaneously differentiated into three germ layers, retained the mutation after reprogramming and displayed normal karyotypes.",nocancer
"Gold nanoparticles have been intensively studied in cancer therapy to improve drug release, increasing therapeutic action and reducing adverse effects. The interaction between gold nanoparticles and cell membranes can give information about the cell internalization. In this study, gold nanoparticles with aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) were synthesized using the photoreduction method (5-ALA: AuNPs). The prodrug 5-ALA is responsible for protoporphyrin IX synthesis inside the cell and allows the use of therapies as photodynamic and sonodynamic therapies. The cytotoxicity test was performed on a breast cancer tumor line (MCF-7), and high Content Screening assay was applied to evaluate the entry of nanoparticles into cells. DPPS Langmuir monolayers were assembled at the air/water interface and employed as a simplified membrane model for half of a tumorigenic cell membrane. We assessed the molecular interactions between 5-ALA: AuNPs and phospholipids using tensiometry (pi-A isotherms) and vibrational spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) experiments. We found that the functionalized gold nanoparticles strongly interact with DPPS polar head groups (especially phosphate and carbonyl), changing the phospholipid hydration and leading to a general decrease in the monolayer conformational order. This work then probes that specific interaction between 5-ALA: AuNPs and the negatively charged phospholipid can be assessed using Langmuir monolayers as simplified biomembrane models.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: A comprehensive response to the unprecedented SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) challenges for public health and its impact on radiation oncology patients and personnel for resilience and adaptability is presented. METHODS: The general recommendations included working remotely when feasible, implementation of screening/safety and personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines, social distancing, regular cleaning of treatment environment, and testing for high-risk patients/procedures. All teaching conferences, tumor boards, and weekly chart rounds were conducted using a virtual platform. Additionally, specific recommendations were given to each section to ensure proper patient treatments. The impact of these measures, especially adaptability and resilience, were evaluated through specific questionnaire surveys. RESULTS: These comprehensive COVID-19-related measures resulted in most staff expressing a consistent level of satisfaction in regard to personal safety, maintaining a safe work environment, continuing quality patient care, and continuing educational activities during the pandemic. There was a significant reduction in patient treatments and on-site patient visits with an appreciable increase in the number of telemedicine e-visits. CONCLUSIONS: Survey results demonstrated substantial adaptability and resilience, including in the rapid recovery of departmental activities during the reactivation phase. In the event of a future public health emergency, the measures implemented may be adopted with good outcomes by radiation oncology departments across the globe.",nocancer

Improved diagnostic strategies to monitor disease activity more accurately are necessary to conduct and evaluate medical treatment. High level of neutrophil infiltration in colon is associated with poor prognosis and enhanced risk of developing colitis-associated cancer. Herein, to accurately monitor neutrophil levels in colitis condition, we designed and constructed a specific probe (CPM), consisting of a neutrophil formyl peptide receptor targeting group (cFLFLFK), a short PEG linker and a near-infrared fluorescent dye. CPM selectively identified neutrophils in vitro and preferentially recognized neutrophils in vivo with enhanced targeting ability and biodistribution property. After verified the ability to target activated neutrophils, CPM was used to detect neutrophils in experimental colitis by systemic and topical administration. Compared to systemic administration, topical administration of CPM allows lower dosage, higher target-to-background ratio and longer duration of effective monitoring. More importantly, we used CPM to assess neutrophil levels in the course of colitis development. The fluorescence intensity of CPM increased along with colitis progression. Additionally, CPM was used to detected neutrophil levels in colitis-associated cancer and enhanced neutrophil infiltration in the tumor sites was detected. In conclusion, the probe CPM is a promising tool for in vivo improved diagnosis of colitis severity by monitoring the extent of neutrophil infiltration.",nocancer
"An association between the cancer invasive activities of cells and their exposure to advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) was described early in some reports. An incubation of cells with BSA-AGE (bovine serum albumin-AGE), BSA-carboxymethyllysine and BSA-methylglyoxal (BSA-MG) resulted in a significant increase in DNA damage. We examined the genotoxic activity of new products synthesized under nonaqueous conditions. These were high molecular mass MAGEs (HMW-MAGEs) formed from protein and melibiose and low molecular mass MAGEs (LMW-MAGEs) obtained from the melibiose and N-alpha-acetyllysine and N-alpha-acetylarginine. We have observed by measuring of micronuclei in human lymphocytes in vitro that the studied HMW-MAGEs expressed the genotoxicity. The number of micronuclei (MN) in lymphocytes reached 40.22 +- 5.34 promille (MN/1000CBL), compared to 28.80 +- 6.50 MN/1000 CBL for the reference BSA-MG, whereas a control value was 20.66 +- 1.39 MN/1000CBL. However, the LMW-MAGE fractions did not induce micronuclei formation in the culture of lymphocytes and partially protected DNA against damage in the cells irradiated with X-ray. Human melanoma and all other studied cells, such as bronchial epithelial cells, lung cancer cells and colorectal cancer cells, are susceptible to the genotoxic effects of HMW-MAGEs. The LMW-MAGEs are not genotoxic, while they inhibit HMW-MAGE genotoxic activity. With regard to apoptosis, it is induced with the HMW-MAGE compounds, in the p53 independent way, whereas the low molecular mass product inhibits the apoptosis induction. Further investigations will potentially indicate beneficial apoptotic effect on cancer cells.",nocancer
"Astaxanthin (ATX) is a red pigment carotenoid present in shrimp, salmon, crab, and asteroidean. Several studies have corroborated the anti-oxidant efficacy of ATX. In addition, ATX has anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-proliferative properties. In the present review, we discuss the role of Nrf2 in mediating the anti-cancer, anti-aging, neuroprotective, lung-protective, skin-protective, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, anti-diabetic and muscloprotective effects of ATX.",nocancer
"Inhibition of MER receptor tyrosine kinase (MERTK) causes direct tumor cell killing and stimulation of the innate immune response. Therefore, MERTK has been identified as a therapeutic target in a wide variety of human tumors. Clinical trials targeting MERTK have recently been initiated, however, none of these drugs are MERTK-specific. Herein, we present the discovery of a highly MERTK-selective inhibitor UNC5293 (24). UNC5293 has subnanomolar activity against MERTK with an excellent Ambit selectivity score (S50 (100 nM) = 0.041). It mediated potent and selective inhibition of MERTK in cell-based assays. Furthermore, it has excellent mouse PK properties (7.8 h half-life and 58% oral bioavailability) and was active in bone marrow leukemia cells in a murine model.",nocancer
"Diosgenin (DSG) has attracted attention recently as a potential anticancer therapeutic agent due to its profound antitumor activity. To better utilize DSG as an antitumor compound, two series of DSG-amino acid ester derivatives (3a-3g and 7a-7g) were designed and synthesized, and their cytotoxic activities against six human cancer cell lines (K562, T24, MNK45, HepG2, A549, and MCF-7) were evaluated. The results obtained showed that a majority of derivatives exhibited cytotoxic activities against these six human tumor cells. Structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that the introduction of l-tryptophan to the C-3 position of DSG and the C-26 position of derivative 5 was the preferred option for these compounds to display significant cytotoxic activities. Among them, compound 7g exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the K562 cell line (IC50 = 4.41 muM) and was 6.8-fold more potent than diosgenin (IC50 = 30.04 muM). Further cellular mechanism studies in K562 cells elucidated that compound 7g triggered mitochondrial-related apoptosis by increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), which was associated with upregulation of the gene and protein expression levels of Bax, downregulation of the gene and protein expression levels of Bcl-2 and activation of the caspase cascade. The above results suggested that compound 7g might be considered a promising scaffold for further modification of more potent anticancer agents.",nocancer
"Protein kinases regulate nearly all aspects of cell life, and alterations in their expression, or mutations in their genes, cause cancer and other diseases. Here, we review the remarkable progress made over the past 20 years in improving the potency and specificity of small-molecule inhibitors of protein and lipid kinases, resulting in the approval of more than 70 new drugs since imatinib was approved in 2001. These compounds have had a significant impact on the way in which we now treat cancers and non-cancerous conditions. We discuss how the challenge of drug resistance to kinase inhibitors is being met and the future of kinase drug discovery.",nocancer
"Single-cell analysis is critical to revealing cell-to-cell heterogeneity that would otherwise be lost in ensemble analysis. Detailed lipidome characterization for single cells is still far from mature, especially when considering the highly complex structural diversity of lipids and the limited sample amounts available from a single cell. We report the development of a general strategy enabling single-cell lipidomic analysis with high structural specificity. Cell fixation is applied to retain lipids in the cell during batch treatments prior to single-cell analysis. In addition to tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealing the class and fatty acyl-chain for lipids, batch photochemical derivatization and single-cell droplet treatment are performed to identify the C=C locations and sn-positions of lipids, respectively. Electro-migration combined with droplet-assisted electrospray ionization enables single-cell mass spectrometry analysis with easy operation but high efficiency in sample usage. Four subtypes of human breast cancer cells are correctly classified through quantitative analysis of lipid C=C location or sn-position isomers in ~160 cells. Most importantly, the single-cell deep lipidomics strategy successfully discriminates gefitinib-resistant cells from a population of wild-type human lung cancer cells (HCC827), highlighting its unique capability to promote precision medicine.",nocancer
"BACKGROUND: In precision medicine biomarkers stratify patients into groups that are offered different treatments, but this may conflict with the principle of equal treatment. While some patient characteristics are seen as relevant for unequal treatment and others not, it is known that they all may influence treatment decisions. How biomarkers influence these decisions is not known, nor is their ethical relevance well discussed. METHODS: We distributed an email survey designed to elicit treatment preferences from Norwegian doctors working with cancer patients. In a forced-choice conjoint analysis pairs of hypothetical patients were presented, and we calculated the average marginal component effect of seven individual patient characteristics, to estimate how each of them influence doctors' priority-setting decisions. RESULTS: A positive biomarker status increased the probability of being allocated the new drug, while older age, severe comorbidity and reduced physical function reduced the probability. Importantly, sex, education level and smoking status had no significant influence on the decision. CONCLUSION: Biomarker status is perceived as relevant for priority setting decisions, alongside more well-known patient characteristics like age, physical function and comorbidity. Based on our results, we discuss a framework that can help clarify whether biomarker status should be seen as an ethically acceptable factor for providing unequal treatment to patients with the same disease.",nocancer
"As one of the crucial factors associated with human life span and cancer progression, telomerase is regarded as an emerging biomarker for cancer diagnosis. Therefore, a facile, rapid and sensitive approach for telomerase activity detection with point-of-care (POC) diagnosis potential is in great demands. Herein, an all-in-one telomerase activity detection assay was established based on the telomere synthesis activated CRISPR-Cas12a system. A telomerase extension reaction generated telomere repeats sequences (TTAGGG)n, which was recognized by a customized CRISPR-guided RNA (crRNA) simultaneously, and finally activated a typical trans-cleavage based CRISPR-Cas12a detection assay. With the inherent sensitivity of CRISPR-Cas12a, this approach achieved a great linear regression ranging from 100 to 2000 HeLa cells and a limitation of detection down to 26 HeLa cells. Moreover, by using the proposed method, telomerase can be detected in one pot under isothermal condition (37  C) by a simple and fast workflow (one step within 1 h). Due to its excellent performance, this all-in-one method shows great potential in POC detection of the telomerase activity.",nocancer
"This study is aimed at developing a micellar carrier for an Anderson-type manganese polyoxomolybdate (TRIS-MnPOMo) to improve the potency and reduce the general toxicity. The biotin-targeted stearic acid-polyethylene glycol (SPB) polymeric conjugate was selected for the first time as a micelle-forming basis for the delivery of TRIS-MnPOMo to breast cancer cells. The cytotoxicity of TRIS-MnPOMo and its nanomicellar form (TRIS-MnPOMo@SPB) was evaluated against MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer cell lines), and HUVEC (normal cell line) in vitro using the MTT assay. The quantity of cellular uptake and apoptosis level were studied properly using standard methods. The hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, and polydispersity index of the prepared micelles were 140 nm, -15.6 mV, and 0.16, respectively. The critical micelle concentration was about 30 mug/mL, which supports the colloidal stability of the micellar dispersion. The entrapment efficiency was interestingly high (about 82%), and a pH-responsive release of TRIS-MnPOMo was successfully achieved. The micellar form showed better cytotoxicity than the free TRIS-MnPOMo on cancer cells without any significant heme and normal cell toxicity. Biotin-targeted nanomicelles internalized into the MDA-MB-231 cells interestingly better than nontargeted micelles and TRIS-MnPOMo, most probably via the endocytosis pathway. Furthermore, at the same concentration, micelles remarkably increased the level of induced apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, TRIS-MnPOMo@SPB could profoundly improve potency, safety, and cellular uptake; these results are promising for further evaluations in vivo.",nocancer
"Multi-arm clinical trials are complex experiments which involve several objectives. The demand for unequal allocations in a multi-treatment context is growing and adaptive designs are being increasingly used in several areas of medical research. For uncensored and censored exponential responses, we propose a constrained optimization approach in order to derive the design maximizing the power of the multivariate test of homogeneity, under a suitable ethical constraint. In the absence of censoring, we obtain a very simple closed-form solution that dominates the balanced design in terms of power and ethics. Our suggestion can also accommodate delayed responses and staggered entries, and can be implemented via response adaptive rules. While other targets proposed in the literature could present an unethical behavior, the suggested optimal allocation is frequently unbalanced by assigning more patients to the best treatment, both in the absence and presence of censoring. We evaluate the operating characteristics of our proposal theoretically and by simulations, also redesigning a real lung cancer trial, showing that the constrained optimal target guarantees very good performances in terms of ethical demands, power and estimation precision. Therefore, it is a valid and useful tool in designing clinical trials, especially oncological trials and clinical experiments for grave and novel infectious diseases, where the ethical concern is of primary importance.",nocancer
"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) often suffers from the exacerbated tumor hypoxia and the heterogeneous distribution of photosensitizers, leading to an inefficient ROS productivity and availability. In this work, a mitochondria targeted O2 economizer (designated as Mito-OxE) is developed to improve PDT efficiency by alleviating tumor hypoxia and enhancing the subcellular localization of photosensitizers. Specifically, the photosensitizer of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) is modified with the hydrophilic polyethylene glycol and the lipophilic cation of triphenylphosphine (TPP) to fabricate the biocompatible mitochondria targeted photosensitizers (designated as Mito-PSs). And Mito-OxE is prepared by using Mito-PSs to load the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors of atovaquone (ATO). Benefiting from the targeting capability of TPP, Mito-OxE can selectively accumulate in mitochondria after cellular uptake. Subsequently, the mitochondrial respiration would be suppressed to with the participation of ATO, resulting in a local hypoxia mitigation for enhanced PDT. Compared with Mito-PSs, Mito-OxE maximizes the therapeutic effect against hypoxic tumors under light irradiation. This design of mitochondria targeted O2 economizer would advance the development of targeted drug delivery system for effective PDT regardless of hypoxic microenvironment.",nocancer
"CeO2 nanoenzyme possesses multiple enzyme-mimicking activities and excellent biocompatibility. However, its weak peroxidase (POD)-mimicking property in the tumor microenvironment (TME) hinders its further tumor therapy application. To enhance CeO2 nanoenzyme's POD activity and overcome limitations of single therapeutic modality, a novel antitumor controlled drug release system (CCCs NPs) was designed using Cu doped cerium oxide nanoparticles (Cu-CeO2 NPs) loaded with clinical anti-cancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) as the core and the breast cancer cell membrane as the outer shell. Cu doping endowed CeO2 NPs' with significantly enhanced POD-mimicking activity in the TME due to a remarkably higher Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio. The cancer cell membrane coating enabled our nanomedicine with homotypic targeting property. Combined with chemotherapeutic drug DOX, a selective and nearly complete tumor suppression was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably, under physiological condition, CCCs NPs worked as a radical scavenger to protect normal cells from oxidative stress caused by anti-cancer drug DOX and OH generated via Fenton-like reaction. Collectively, our CCCs NPs offered a therapeutic potential for effective breast cancer therapy while being free of side effects.",nocancer
"This paper reports for the first time the occurrence, fates, and carcinogenic risks of 20 substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (SPAHs) and 16 priority PAH species in two coking wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (plant E and central WWTP). The measured total concentrations of PAHs and SPAHs in raw wastewater of coking plant E were 3700 and 1200 mug L-1, respectively, with naphthalene (1400 mug L-1), and fluoranthene (353 mug L-1) as dominant PAH species and 2-methylnaphthalene (167 mug L-1), anthraquinone (133 mug L-1), and 1-methylnaphthalene (132 mug L-1) as dominant SPAHs. For the 11 methyl-PAHs (MPAHs), 4 oxygenated-PAHs (OPAHs), and 5 nitrated-PAHs (NPAHs) investigated, the biological wastewater treatment process removed 98.6% MPAHs, 83.9% OPAHs, and 89.1% NPAHs. Mass balance analysis result revealed that transformation was the major mechanism to remove low-molecular-weight (LMW) MPAHs (59.9-77.3%), a large part of OPAHs, including anthraquinone, methylanthraquinone, and 9-fluorenone (46.7-49.6%), and some NPAHs, including 2-nitrofluorene and 9-nitroanthrancene (52.9-59.1%). Adsorption by activated sludge mainly accounted for removing high-molecular-weight (HMW) SPAHs (59.6-71.01%). The relatively high concentrations of SPAHs in excess sludge (15,000 mug g-1) and treated effluent (104 mug L-1) are of great concern for their potential adverse ecological impacts. SPAHS exhibited similar behaviors in central WWTP, though the influent concentrations were much lower. The concentration levels of SPAHs in the ambient air of coking plant E and central WWTP may also pose potential lung cancer risks (LCR) to the workers through inhalation, where all studied SPAHs except 3-nitrofluoranthene and 7-nitrobenz[a]anthracene exceeded the acceptable cancer risk standards (>10-6) recommended by U.S EPA. This study could help identify the ecological and healthy risks during coking wastewater treatment and provide useful information for policy-making.",nocancer
"PURPOSE: To compare markers of health associated with chronic diseases between yoga and non-yoga participants. METHODS: 30 participants were categorized as either: 1) ""Yoga"" engaging in yoga >=2 times/week for >=6 months, or 2) ""Non-yoga"" not engaging in yoga. RESULTS: Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores were significantly different between the yoga and non-yoga groups (PSS: 8.0 vs. 17.5, respectively, p < 0.05; BDI-II: 1.0 vs. 5.5, respectively, p < 0.05). No significant differences were evident between groups for inflammatory markers nor Complex V of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate values differed between groups based on clinical cutoffs, with yoga participants categorized as normal (11.0 mm) and non-yoga above normal (21.5 mm). CONCLUSION: This research supports that yoga participation is associated with lower PSS and BDI-II scores but does not support a relationship with markers of inflammation. Further research is warranted.",nocancer
"Two series of olmutinib derivatives containing an acrylamide moiety were designed and synthesized, and their IC50 values against cancer cell lines (A549, H1975, NCI-H460, LO2, and MCF-7) were evaluated. Most of the compounds exhibited moderate cytotoxic activity against the five cancer cell lines. The most promising compound, H10, showed not only excellent activity against EGFR kinase but also positive biological activity against PI3K kinase. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) suggested that the introduction of dimethylamine scaffolds with smaller spatial structures was more favorable for antitumor activity. Additionally, the substitution of different acrylamide side chains had different effects on the activity of compounds. Generally, compounds H7 and H10 were confirmed as promising antitumor agents.",nocancer

"ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are commonly mutated in human cancer. Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes comprise three conserved multisubunit chromatin remodelers (cBAF, ncBAF and PBAF) that share the BRG1 (also known as SMARCA4) subunit responsible for the main ATPase activity. BRG1 is the most frequently mutated Snf2-like ATPase in cancer. In the present study, we have investigated the role of SWI/SNF in genome instability, a hallmark of cancer cells, given its role in transcription, DNA replication and DNA-damage repair. We show that depletion of BRG1 increases R-loops and R-loop-dependent DNA breaks, as well as transcription-replication (T-R) conflicts. BRG1 colocalizes with R-loops and replication fork blocks, as determined by FANCD2 foci, with BRG1 depletion being epistatic to FANCD2 silencing. Our study, extended to other components of SWI/SNF, uncovers a key role of the SWI/SNF complex, in particular cBAF, in helping resolve R-loop-mediated T-R conflicts, thus, unveiling a new mechanism by which chromatin remodeling protects genome integrity.",nocancer
"Construction of multifunctional nonviral gene vectors to execute defined tasks holds great potential for the precise and effective treatment of gene-associated diseases. Herein, we have developed four large pi-conjugation triphenylamine derivatives bearing two polar [12]aneN3 heads and a lipophilic tail for applications in gene delivery, one/two-photon-triggered near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence bioimaging, and combined photodynamic therapy (PDT) and gene therapy of cancer. These compounds possess typical NIR aggregation-induced emission characteristics, mega Stokes shifts, strong two-photon excitation fluorescence, and excellent DNA condensation abilities. Among them, vector 4 with a tail of n-hexadecane realized a transfection efficiency as high as 6.7 times that of the commercial transfection agent Lipofectamine 2000 in HEK293T cell lines. Using vector 4 as an example, transfection process tracking and ex vivo/in vivo tumoral imaging and retention with high resolution, high brightness, deep tissue penetration, and good biosafety were demonstrated. In addition, efficient singlet oxygen (1O2) generation by the DNA complex formed by vector 4 (4/DNA) resulted in effective PDT. Combined with anticancer gene therapy, collaborative cancer treatment with a dramatically enhanced cancer cell-killing effect was achieved. The development of this ""three birds, one stone"" approach suggests a new and promising strategy for better cancer treatment and real-time tracking of gene delivery.",nocancer
"The incidence of metabolic and chronic diseases including cancer, obesity, inflammation-related diseases sharply increased in the 21st century.

"Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] and its compounds have caused serious environmental pollution and health damage. Senescent cells can actively change the surrounding environment by secreting some factors, which are called senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Our previous work has confirmed that premature senescent hepatocytes induced by Cr(VI) expressed high level of Clusterin (CLU) and secrete interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8. CLU is involved in the regulation of tumor development and drug resistance, but whether CLU regulates SASP components and participates in Cr(VI)-induced malignant transformation is unclear. In this study we demonstrated that Cr(VI) induced the secretion of tumor promoting components of SASP such as IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in senescent L-02 hepatocytes, while the levels of the anti-tumor components of SASP such as chemokine (c-x-c motif) ligand-1 (CXCL-1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were not altered. CLU shRNA interference significantly reduced the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF in the culture medium of senescent cells, suggesting CLU may regulate SASP. The NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC significantly alleviated Cr(VI)-induced increase of IL-6, IL-8, and GM-CSF, confirming that NF-kappaB can regulate the tumor promoting components of SASP. CLU shRNA interference aggravated the inhibitory effect of PDTC on SASP secretion, indicating that CLU regulated the secretion of SASP in Cr(VI)-induced senescent hepatocytes through the NF-kappaB signaling. We speculated that SASP secreted by Cr(VI)-induced premature senescent hepatocytes was tightly related to the carcinogenic effect of Cr(VI). Therefore, elucidation of upstream regulatory mechanism of SASP is of great significance. In addition to further clarifying the carcinogenic mechanisms associated with Cr(VI), we could also seek out new targets for treatment of Cr(VI)-related cancer.",nocancer
"Bottom-up proteomics has been increasingly applied in clinical research to study the disease pathophysiology and to discover disease biomarkers. However, glycoproteomic analysis always requires tedious experimental steps for intact glycopeptide enrichment, which has been the technique bottleneck for large-scale analysis of clinical samples. Herein, we developed an automated glycopeptide enrichment method for the analysis of serum site-specific N-glycoproteome. This automated method allowed for processing one sample within 20 min. It showed higher enrichment specificity, more intact glycopeptide identifications, and better quantitative reproducibility than the traditional manual method using microtip enrichment devices. We further applied this method to investigate the serum site-specific N-glycosylation changes between four patients with pancreatic cancer and seven healthy controls. The principal component analysis of intact N-glycopeptides showed good clustering across cancer and normal groups. Furthermore, we found that the site-specific glycoforms, monofucosylated and nonsialylated oligosaccharides, on IgG1 site 180 expressed a significant decrease in pancreatic cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Together, the automated method is a powerful tool for site-specific N-glycoproteomic analysis of complex biological samples, and it has great potential for clinical utilities.",nocancer
"Chemo-immunotherapy based on immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. However, the effective ICD requires a high dosage of ICD stimulus, which could be associated to a dose-dependent toxicity. Therefore, in this study, a liposome remote-loaded with shikonin (a potent ICD stimulus) was developed, with the ability to effectively induce ICD at high dosage in vivo. However, a hepatotoxic effect was observed. To circumvent this problem, shikonin was combined with the anthracycline mitoxantrone or doxorubicin to develop co-loaded liposomes inducing a synergistic ICD effect and cytotoxicity to tumor cells. Cytotoxicity and uptake experiment in vitro were performed to analyze the optimal synergistic ratio of shikonin and anthracyclines based on a ""formulated strategy"". Interestingly, copper mediated co-loaded liposomes resulted in a pH and GSH dual-responsive release property. More importantly, pharmacokinetics and tumor biodistribution studies revealed an outstanding capacity of ratiometric delivery of dual drugs. Thus, the dual-loaded liposome enhanced the antitumor effect by the stimulation of a robust immune response at lower doses of the drugs with a higher safety compared to single-loaded liposomes. Summarized, the current work provided a reference for a rational design and development of liposomal co-delivery system of drugs and ICD-induced chemo-immunotherapy, and established a potential clinical application of shikonin-based drug combinations as a new chemo-immunotherapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.",nocancer
"Novel polysaccharide-platinum conjugated polymers bearing alendronate on Portulaca oleracea polysaccharides (PPS) were designed and synthesized. Their chemical structures and properties were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), 1H NMR and 31P NMR spectroscopy, Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-vis) and other analysis methods. The results demonstrated that alendronate can be used as the linker of Portulaca oleracea polysaccharides and platinum compounds. Portulaca oleracea polysaccharides-alendronate (PPS-ALN) conjugates exhibited stronger antioxidant ability than PPS. The cytotoxicity assay to cancer cells was tested in vitro, and the Portulaca oleracea polysaccharides-alendronate-platinum (PPS-ALN-Pt) conjugates strongly inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells than PPS and PPS-ALN. The evaluation of complexes affinity toward supercoiled plasmid DNA, displayed a high DNA interaction. Interestingly, the platinum conjugates displayed immunological competence in HeLa cells by cellular immunofluorescence assay. Besides, the cellular platinum accumulation of PPS-ALN-Pt conjugates was higher than that of cisplatin in HeLa cells, implying that the polysaccharide-platinum conjugated polymers might have a synergistically therapeutic application in metal anticancer drug delivery.",nocancer
